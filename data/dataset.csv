2007-05-21,45:22,10.0,0.333,10.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,"I know you say that you're a football player, but do you think football players would get some fouls?","(Laughing) It was definitely a physical game tonight.  You know, fouls were called at times and weren't called at times.  You know, this is what it's about.  You know, you can't look to get fouls and you've got to try to be as aggressive as possible."
2007-05-21,45:22,10.0,0.333,10.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,"The last play there, Coach said that was kind of a read-react for you.  Did you feel that you didn't have a shot at the layup and that's why you kicked it out to Donyell for the shot?","No, I go for the winning play.  If two guys come at you and your teammate is open, then give it up.  Simple as that."
2007-05-21,45:22,10.0,0.333,10.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,"As a franchise player, how do you justify only taking three shots in the fourth quarter of a pretty tight game?  Do you think the fact you didn't go to the free-throw line tonight is maybe a statement on your aggressiveness or lack thereof?","No, you've just got to take what's there.  It's not about taking a high volume of shots, it's about trying to win the basketball game.  You've got to take what's there.  We had an opportunity to me with me taking three shots in the fourth quarter.  We game is not solely on taking a lot of shots.  I'm going to continue to say that.  That's the only answer I can give you.  We had an opportunity to win."
2007-05-21,45:22,10.0,0.333,10.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,"Coach said that a couple of adjustments need to be made.  You played pretty well as a team overall, got away at the end.  Does anything stand out in your mind, adjustments to make for Game 2?","We definitely played pretty well.  Both teams are going to make adjustments, you just do that in the playoffs.  But as a whole we played pretty well.  You can't ask for nothing more than what we did tonight.  We always want to win the ballgame, but we always say if we play as hard as we did tonight for 48 minutes, like we did, we're not satisfied but we can look back and say, okay, we're okay with this loss tonight."
2007-05-21,45:22,10.0,0.333,10.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,"Third quarter, again, you guys fell behind 7-0, I think they started with a run, there was a 17-6 run before it settled down.  It's the third game in a row.  What seems to be the problem coming out of the locker room at halftime with you guys?","Not sure.  It's just something that we've got to work on and get better at.  At times we look to take too many jump shots to start the third quarter instead of attacking. Definitely with a team like Detroit that's very efficient on the offensive end, we've got to know how to pick your poison at times, and if there's a jump shot that's open, take your shot."
2007-05-21,45:22,10.0,0.333,10.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,What does it feel like to have a team play defense against you and not be able to do what you're normally used to?,"They played great.  I mean, their defensive mindset is very good.  But for me, I just -- you just take what's there.  You know, if you get a good look at it, you go for it.  If not you kick it to a teammate.  Simple as that. End of FastScripts"
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,Describe the last 24 seconds of the game.,"Just wanted to try to get the best shots possible to try to either give us the lead, get fouled, go to the line and try to send us home with a win."
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,Do you feel you got fouled on the last play?,"I believe there was some contact, but there's been a lot of contact throughout this series.  We're a no-excuse team, you know, and we can't look at the last play as why we lost.  We've just got to get better.  But I do feel there was some contact."
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,Enough to force you to miss the shot?,I think so.
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,"When you're kicking that ball out to Sasha, I mean, Flip used the expression ""Ground Hog Day,"" how much did it feel like, wow, here we go again with the same play that ended the game?","That was definitely a good look.  I thought Sasha had the opportunity to shoot the ball, and I guess he seen Chauncey closing out and he couldn't get the shot up.  It was a tough play for Sasha, tough play for us but we had to try to at least get the ball up at the rim.  We can't have a turnover."
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,How did you feel in general about your performance?,"I played pretty good.  I can play a lot better.  At the end of the day we didn't win.  You know, we gave ourselves a chance to win the game, when it came down to the final possessions and we can't make the right plays and we didn't get the stop that we needed to win the ballgame."
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,"Your body language was looking pretty frustrated all night, kind of slumping your shoulders, rolling your eyes and looking at your bench.  Was that call-related or --","That was just me wanting to win the basketball game.  I never felt frustrated.  I just wanted to execute as best we can on the offensive and on the defensive end trying to get stops. No frustrations at all, though, in my teammates.  I can't be frustrated out there me trying to be a leader.  I just want to win the ballgame."
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,"After that final Cleveland possession after the clock stopped with one second left, we could see you saying something to the referees, what were you saying?","That's over and done with.  Me and the ref had a good conversation, and I've moved on as a player."
2007-05-24,44:41,19.0,0.368,6.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,"This is the second game in a row where the Pistons came out of the locker room and really made a difference at the beginning of the third quarter, what do you think happens there that causes that problem?","I'm not sure.  They've definitely got a good plan coming out in the third quarter.  That's something as a team we've got to figure it out, but they do a great job in the third quarter of coming out and putting the pressure on you.  We haven't been a good third quarter team all year.  I don't know why.  That's something we'll have to figure out very soon or we're going home. End of FastScripts"
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, what was different tonight offensively for you guys throughout the entire game that allowed you guys to get better looks and shoot a better percentage?","Well, we did a great job of coming down the early offense and getting to our offense a lot quicker, attacking a lot quicker before their defense set.  They're very good when you allow them to set up.  So we did a great job of coming down early on offense, moving the ball, getting it from one side to the other, drive and kick, and it worked for us."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you said earlier today that this was the biggest game of your life; you responded.  What was different?  Did you realize that just you've got to play at a different level at this point?","It's all or nothing at this point.  You either make a series and be 2-1 or you make the impossible and be down 3-0.  It's common sense.  For me it was the biggest game of my career, and I was happy that my teammates were able to help me get through it, and we won a big game."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, the question on the dunk with Rasheed, just describe the play.","Any time you get on offensive rebound, it allows the defense not to set.  So I just wanted to try to be aggressive and I was able to get to the hole and seen the open lane and was able to make something happen."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,Can you talk about the last shot you made over Rip with 16 seconds to go.  Can you talk about that play.,"It was definitely an opportunity for me to just -- just wanting to be aggressive and try to see the whole floor.  If a double-team came, try to get the ball up, and if not, try to be as patient as I could, try to get the shot clock, try to get some time off of it.  I didn't want to force it to the basket.  I was able to take just a very comfortable mid-range jump shot and it was a big play for us."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, after all the debate over the first two games, are you feeling any sense of vindication whatsoever after this win?","No, all I'm excited about was I was able to get a team victory.  This guy sitting next to me is growing up before our eyes, and he played some big minutes for us tonight.  Defensively he was very in tune and we responded."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"You mentioned Daniel grew tonight.  Do you feel like you grew a little tonight, too?","I grow a little every night.  I need my teammates out on the court to make me grow.  You see a guy like Daniel, as young as he is and as young as I am, we're out there working as hard as we can to try to win ballgames.  It's a great opportunity and great to see he made the most of it. We ain't done yet.  We've still got to hold down home court and try to make it a three-game series."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,It just seemed like you were not only trying to push along Daniel but everybody else on your team.  We could see you during timeouts yelling encouragement.  What were you thinking during timeouts and what made you grow aggressively in the huddle?,"Being in the same situation honestly in the first two games, you don't want to let one slip away again.  I could see if we could just get over the hump finally, we could win this ballgame.  We finally got the stop that we needed.  We finally made the offensive execution play that we needed.  I wanted to make sure that the guys were very in tune and know that hey, we need one more stop here, we need the offensive execution, and win the ballgame, and the guys responded."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"Could you talk a little bit about Zydrunas and when he's playing like he did tonight, what that does for the rest of your offense?","Well, it definitely helps us perimeter guys when you have inside presence, and Z shot the ball extremely well.  He defended extremely well and it just spreads the defense out when you have a guy that's seven-foot tall that can shoot outside jumpers and get to the lane.  As perimeter guys we need that production out of our bigs, and he showed up tonight and it was great to see."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"When you were preparing for this game we asked you what you specifically wanted to do, and you said that you personally wanted to be more aggressive.  Can you analyze for us to what degree you were more aggressive in this game and how.","Just not holding the ball as much and allowing our defense to set.  Like I said before, they're very, very good when you allow them to set up.  I was very aggressive early in trying to attack before their five guys were able to set up on the defensive end.  I was a little bit more aggressive on the post, not allowing their guys to bump me out to the perimeter.  Once I started getting some easy buckets, that opened up my outside shot.  Very productive."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you talked about how starved this city is for a winner and a championship, can you talk about the crowd and what that means to both of you guys when you're out there.","Well, we knew it was going to be electrifying tonight, first time since '92.  Like I said before, I was a WWF fan at that time, so I don't know what Cleveland sports was doing at that time. The crowd was exciting.  We need them to be the same way on Tuesday because they really helped us.  It gets us a little bit more energy when they're out there cheering.  I mean, they deserve it.  We haven't had a Cleveland sports team or Ohio sports team win in a long time, so they really deserve it."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, having won a game like this, do you feel like now you've learned how to win close playoff games?","I've won a lot of playoff games in my two years in the playoffs.  I mean, I just try to be the best player I can be out there for my teammates.  You learn from mistakes, you learn from wins and you learn from losses, but this game doesn't put something on me where it's saying, hey, I've finally done it.  I've won playoff games before, I've won playoff series.  This is a big game and we won it and we need to move on."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,"You told us before you did a little bit more unusual pregame preparation for today, can you tell us more about your morning and afternoon and any meaningful conversations you might have had with your family.","It's the first time in my career I've ever showed up to the gym three hours before a game.  I usually take my nap before the game, and I woke up earlier today, so I had nothing else to do.  I didn't want to sit around.  I didn't want to continue to answer my phone about tickets (laughter), so I came to the gym and I turned my phone off and I was here, and the guys were still setting up the camera on the baskets. The mindset that I had today coming to this ballgame was we have to win, simple as that.  We have to win.  And me being the leader of this team, I have to be that guy that sparks this team, I have to be that guy that does it on both ends of the floor, but at the same time, my teammates, when they see that, they have to respond, also, with me, and I guess we did it."
2007-05-27,46:07,32.0,0.571,9.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,Will you do the same Tuesday?,I don't know. End of FastScripts
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,"2-2 now going back to Detroit, very similar two last year.  Can you take me through the mindset of this team able to get back to this point and make this a whole new series?","We were definitely a much better team going into Detroit last year.  We won the game just because we have more playoff experience.  Last year was based on us making the playoffs; this year is based on us getting to the championships, and we have to approach it with the same mentality that we had.  Honestly for the first four games we only have two games to show for it."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, earlier in the playoffs you were talking about the team in the fourth quarter and how you felt good about fourth quarter situations.  The last two games were won the game in the fourth quarter.","Have to clean up that third quarter.  Good in the fourth, but that third quarter is going to catch up to us sooner or later, and I don't know what we're going to do about it.  We'll have to put our finger on it some way, some how, but we got stops down the stretch and executed on the offensive end and made big shots and that's what it's about."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, Daniel stepping up big for you guys in key points.  Can you talk about what he meant to the team and the spark he provided.","He definitely gave us a lift throughout the whole game of attacking and getting to the rim.  You know, a lot of guys don't understand that Daniel is much better than shooting an outside shot, which I told you guys after Game 3.  He got to the line 12 times, made technical free-throws, and it's different when everybody else is up there.  It's about talent, I should be a GM someday, I guess."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, with four seconds left, you're on the line.  What are your thoughts that are going through your head?","Make both and the game is over.  You know, I don't want to make the first one, I wanted to make both and there is no way they can win the game with four seconds, and we're smart enough to know if we go up four, don't foul anyone and don't contest, we win the game. I've definitely stepped up with my free-throw percentage and it was something I had to get over with."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,Was Rip bothering you?  What was he doing there?,"The same thing I did to Gilbert last year.  I invented that -- no, no, Scottie Pippen invented that to Karl Malone.  But he tried to mess with me and I have to stay focused."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,I am going to ask you to put your scouting GM hat already:  Break down what was going on with you in the third quarter versus break down what you did so well and what worked for you in the third quarter.,"I missed a lot of shots I usually make in the third quarter, I missed two lay-ups, I missed a wide-open baseline shot, but in the fourth quarter the game is on the line and I live for the fourth quarter.  I love the fourth quarter and I told my teammates, get me to the fourth and it's close, and I'll try my best to win the game and I was able to do that."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,"uestions for both of you:  Drew got called for the technical on Rasheed, how big was that, Drew responding to Rasheed?","I think besides Drew grabbing eight rebounds and 18 points, what he did on Rasheed was big; he was able to front him and the way he played defense on Rasheed allowed us on the backside not to double Rasheed, and allowed us to stay home, and he did a heck of a job.  And to be able to guard Rasheed and score and get the rebound, it was a big inspiration to our team today."
2007-05-29,44:17,25.0,0.421,7.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, how surprised were you that Larry gutted it out, started, give you what he could, and can you talk about what that meant to the team.","I was very surprised, because I know Larry's history of injuries and -- but when I seen him in the training room with his uniform on, I asked him was he going to give it a go and he said ""yeah,"" and that showed me this is more about the team more than anything, and he did what he could. I mean, he came out there -- just being him out on the court and gutting it through.  What he's going through right now was an inspiration for us because we know he could have easily sat out tonight.  But him being on the court and saying, ""who cares about my injury.  It's about this team.""  And it don't get no bigger than that."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you scored 29 of your team's last 30 points in the fourth quarter and the two overtimes, was this just you taking the team on your back and not letting them lose?  What was your mindset?","Just the simple fact of us coming here in Game 1 and 2 and playing so well and falling short, and throughout this whole game we played the same way.  The same way we played in Games 1 and 2, and we couldn't leave out of here without getting at least one win, just as well as we've played in this building, and that was just my mindset."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,LeBron were you surprised at all that through the fourth quarter and the overtime there was so much one-on-one coverage and you were able to drive the lane so easily?,"I don't believe there was a lot of one-on-one coverage; there was a lot of double-teaming, a lot of triple-teaming, and I just tried to get the ball up.  They have to respect my shooters out on the court, with Daniel Gibson and Donyell Marshall and Sasha and Damon Jones and Z, you have to respect my shooters, you can't just leave them open.  So I was able to attack once I got the ball back, and make a lot of tough shots. I give all the credit to my teammates.  This is definitely not an individual performance on my part, but without those other 14 guys, we would be down 3-2 instead of up 3-2."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, were you surprised how easily you were able to get to the rim, especially down the stretch?  You beat Tayshaun Prince for two dunks, one in regular time and one in overtime.","Why do I have to be surprised?  I made a lot of good moves and I was able to finish.  It wasn't just like they opened up the lane and let me through there.  I made a lot of good moves, my teammates did a good job of spacing the floor and I just wanted to try to finish.  They're definitely a great defensive team, but at times I wanted to attack as much as possible and that's it."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, where does this rank for you in terms of performances you've had in a game?","Just for the simple fact that we won the ballgame means more than anything besides my performance.  If I did everything I did tonight and we lost, it means nothing.  So the win is the most important thing for us, and we are one more win from getting to our goal."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,How do you feel right now --,Terrible.

2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,Are you tired?  You feel like you can --,"I'm everything, I'm banged up, I'm winded, I'm fatigued.  I've got all day tomorrow.  It's going to be tough to get some rest when you got a crazy two-year-old running around the house.  So hopefully I can take him to one of his grandma's house."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, how emotional is this for you to have the kind of game you had in this environment, this situation in Game 5, and be able to play the way you played tonight?","The simple fact that I was able to will my team to victory and definitely pleasing to me.  This is definitely a big win, one of the biggest wins in Cavaliers' franchise history, for me and my teammates, it's definitely the biggest win.  But we have a goal, we can't dwell on this tonight when we have another game on Saturday.  We have got to do our best to try to win that ballgame and get where we wanted to be all year."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"When this run of yours started, this scoring, it was right after the Pistons ran off 10-0, about the middle of the fourth quarter, what are you thinking at that point?  At that point do you say, that's enough, I'm not letting this go any farther?","The Pistons do a great job of making runs and you kind of never know when it's going to happen, but when it happens it's quick.  So I just wanted to try to be aggressive and not allow them to make too much of a run, and give ourselves an opportunity to win down at the end of regulation.  And it took two overtimes to do it, but as a team we definitely -- this is a gutted-out victory."
2007-05-31,50:18,48.0,0.545,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you joked around in one of your television commercials about having to go through Detroit, for you what did the pitches represent?","Team passion, hard work, this is a group of guys that's never going to give up, and team basketball.  When you look at San Antonio and you look at Detroit, that's what you want to be at a certain point in your career.  They've done it year after year after year after year after year after year.  So I respect the Pistons more than any team in the league just because I'm in the Eastern Conference, and I play against them as much as I do. So this is definitely a group of guys that have a lot of fight in them, and we have to take the challenge on Saturday. End of FastScripts"
2007-06-02,46:12,20.0,0.273,14.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, can you just put into words what this means to you after what you've been through in this entire series, starting with Game 1, the criticism and everything, and then winning four straight and doing it here at home?","If I could put into words what's going on in my head right now, man, we would be up here for another three hours.  But this is special, the guys were really mentally prepared. We want to give Detroit a lot of credit because they definitely brought out the best in us, but we just believed and guides stepped up, no matter if it was the one guy all the way down to the 15th man on the roster, we believed."

Z has been through a lot, been through losing seasons, year after year after year, and I promised him when I got drafted I was going to try to change it.  If you guys remember when I was in New York, I said I was going to light it up like Vegas in Cleveland.  Awesome, I told you, I'm going to be a GM someday. I told Daniel before the game, I said, ""I believe Detroit is going to double-team me, triple me before I cross halfcourt, so get that gun and get it locked and loaded and just shoot it, don't second guess yourself, just shoot it.""  And that's exactly what happened, and guys stepped up.  Especially Boobie stepped in, knocked big shots down.  When they closed out on him hard, he drove the ball to the rim, got fouled and made free-throws.  This is definitely a big step in Cleveland Cavaliers history."
2007-06-02,46:12,20.0,0.273,14.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,Your individual attention on Daniel and building his confidence through the season and this series particularly.,"I mean, when we got Daniel in the second round I believe it was a blessing in disguise, I believe we got a steal.  I just knew how good of a basketball player he could be, and once I seen his work ethic during practice, after practice, before practice, I mean, I get to the gym early, he's there before me, we're shooting after practice every single day and I just seen his drive and his passion.  And one day we had a sit-around in the locker room when we were struggling and Daniel said, ""Man, if every guy in this locker room just plays as hard as I want to play on this basketball court, we're going to be something special.""  And for a rookie, a guy that really is not even supposed to say something or say nothing at all, I remember that, and you remember what I'm talking about, right? DANIEL GIBSON:  Yeah. LEBRON JAMES:  I remembered what he was talking about and I stayed on him from there.  I just knew he was going to be something special and tonight it was perfect."
2007-06-02,46:12,20.0,0.273,14.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, Game 5 when you scored 29 of 30 points, there was so much talk about this being a one-man team, how important was it to you tonight not only Boobie but other guys step up?  And what does this mean for the team going The Finals?","You guys know how I am about my team.  There is no way we would be here in the Eastern Conference Finals or winning the Eastern Conference Finals if it was a one-man show.  It's never happened in NBA history, it would never happen in the NBA where a team has one guy and he does it all.  My teammates are my family.  I'm with them more than I am with my own family, honestly.  And every time these guys come to the gym, we believe and we made it happen."
2007-06-02,46:12,20.0,0.273,14.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, I notice that in your locker you have a picture of you dunking over Tim Duncan that's been hanging up in your locker room all season.  Can you talk about it right now that you're in this position, you're going to be playing him in The Finals.  Can you talk about the emotion of getting to this point, having that picture in your locker room and now getting to have it happen.","San Antonio is the premier team in our league, playing the best basketball better than any team in this league; they're veterans, they've been there before, they're special.  And we've got to be even more intense, even more physically and mentally in tune to what's going on, when we enter into The Finals s on Thursday.  But just the simple fact of I've always believed in us, from day one, all you guys know I've chanted championship, one, two, three championships.  Every time we brought it up, funny faces at first looked at me.  I didn't care, I kept it going, championship, every single day.  And we've made it happen.  This is special."
2007-06-02,46:12,20.0,0.273,14.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, can you talk a little bit about how big of a switch in momentum it was, when Rasheed got ejected.  You guys had a double-digit lead but there was eight minutes to go and it seemed like everything swung your guys' way.","We felt when we made our run in the fourth quarter it was starting to swing our way, something had to go right for Cleveland sports, something had to go right, and we made a real big run.  This game reminds me of my freshman year in high school in the state championship, and what Boobie did tonight reminded me of our point guard, Drew Joyce hitting six consecutives threes, he hit seven threes in a row, and we won the state championship.  They doubled me, we kicked it to Drew and he hit back to back to back to back threes in a row. And Boobie is unbelievable, what he's done, how he's grown, and I'm lost for words right now, I'm not even answering your question, (Chuckles.)  I'm so excited, I'm not answering your question at all, but you guys know how I feel right now. Yeah, it was a turn when Rasheed got a technical, I guess.  (Laughter.)"
2007-06-02,46:12,20.0,0.273,14.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, when you first came into this league and joined this organization, did you have an idea of when you thought you could get this team to this point?  And also can you talk about Coach Brown who has gotten some criticism from a lot of people, including me all year long.","I never put a time limit on when I thought we could reach this point, but what I did -- I honestly believed we could get better every single year, and I mean, we won 30-something games my rookie year, we won 40 games my second year, missed the playoffs, and in my third year we win 50, my fourth year we win 50, and we've gotten better every single year I've been in this league, and we added the pieces that we needed to compete every single night and brought in a guy in Coach Brown that stresses defense, defense, defense, defense, defense, defense.  And it's unbelievable, you can have so many struggles during the course of a season, so many people criticizing your team, ""they don't have enough pieces, they're not a good outside-shooting team, Coach Brown lacks this, LeBron lacks this,"" but we've also believed and it's always been 15 guys in the locker room that just believed and we have a special team."

You could have beaten a lot of different teams in the Eastern Conference Finals, but beating Detroit had to be special.","If you've been up on my commercials, someone wise told me that I couldn't get through Detroit swimming in a pool, so I guess I had to do it on the court. I think it was just our time.  It was our time.  I think Detroit, we give all the respect in the world to that team.  That team is awesome, they're great but I believe it was just our time and we're here now and we've got -- still got business to do. We're going to enjoy tonight, enjoy our day off tomorrow and get back to work on Monday and get ready for the big bad wolf of the West. End of FastScripts"

What was going through your mind tonight?","You definitely give a lot of credit to the Spurs.  They definitely played well tonight defensively, offensively.  Some of it was me missing a lot of the shots that I usually make and some of it was the defense that they put on me and on our team in general.  It's like a half and half thing."

You're coming to Game 1 you don't know what to expect.  We don't know what they're going to run against us offensively.  We've got to make adjustments in Game 2.  A lot of credit to the, they played extremely well defensively.  It's a series.  Things happen.  They're up 1-0 and we'll make adjustments and be ready for Sunday."

If I went by one guy, another guy stepped up, something I'm going to have to make an adjustment for for Game 2.  I'll definitely be ready to counter some of the things they did defensively."

How would you describe how you played tonight?","I didn't play extremely well, definitely.  Not just shooting the ball, but the six turnovers was uncharacteristic of me in the postseason, tried to force a lot of passes in there that looked open at times but really wasn't.  I have to play better, and for us to win, me being the leader of this team, I have to play better in order for us to have a chance to win down the stretch, and my teammates know I'm going to bring my better effort in Game 2."
2007-06-07,44:00,14.0,0.25,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,0,How did it feel for you out there?,"I feel good.  A lot of shots I took is shots that I make.  They felt pretty good, they just didn't fall for me.  Things like that happen.  You have one off night, but the thing like this is it's not like the NCAA tournament where you have one game and you're out.  We've got to regroup and be ready for Game 2."

Their adjustments, your lack of adjustments?  What is it about the third quarter?","Same answer I keep giving.  We don't know.  We haven't put our finger on the third quarter yet.  We did a better job last year in Game 5 and Game 6 of playing great basketball in the third quarter, but once again it caught up with us again.  We don't know what it is but we did a great job of figuring it out.  We're going to do it pretty soon.  We definitely want to get a win on this floor before we go back home."
2007-06-07,44:00,14.0,0.25,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,0,"Seems like the deeper you go into the playoffs the more people they're sending at you and now it looks like basically you're being played by one, two and three people watching you all the time.  Does it change the game for you?","No, it doesn't.  I know I'm going to see a lot of double teams, at times triple teams.  It's something I've seen before and it's something I've been able to adjust to from game to game and in different series of this postseason.  It's not like I've never seen a double-team or triple-team before, I just have to play better, and I definitely have a better effort on Sunday."
2007-06-07,44:00,14.0,0.25,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, in the Eastern Conference playoffs a lot of the guys who were defending you overplayed you and tried to force you left.  Bruce tried to play you straight up and didn't force you either way.  How did that impact the way you played?","I think defensively he's very good.  He's one of the best defensive players in this league, and the guys behind him help him a lot.  It gives him an opportunity to get up into me and force me into the bigs, and the bigs are very good, Elson and Duncan, of course.  He has a lot behind him.  He doesn't have to do it by himself.  I'm able to go right and left, so there's nothing that I can't do out on the ball court.  I'll just have to make an adjustment and come into Game 2 with a better mindset and try to get a win."
2007-06-07,44:00,14.0,0.25,7.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,0,Here's a football analogy.  It seems like they wanted to make you go east and west instead of north and south.  Is that a fair assessment?,"That's definitely a fair assessment and I have to do a better job of trying to recognize that, trying to attack north and south instead of east and west.  They tried to make me dribble out towards the side line.  The bigs did a great job coming off pick-and-rolls, of showing hard and allowing Bruce to get underneath the big, try and attack me coming right underneath the big.  I think our coaching staff is very aware of what was going on, what happened in Game 1.  I think our players are very aware of what happened in Game 1, and we'll make an adjustment.  It's not like we haven't been in this situation before. End of FastScripts"

You came away fairly confident going back home.  These two games you were down 18 yesterday and 29 -- or two days ago, 18 and then 30.  What do you take from these first two games going back to Cleveland?  How different is the feeling?","We're definitely still confident.  It doesn't matter if you lose by 1 or lose by 30 with us.  A loss is a loss, and we've been down 2-0 before in this situation, so we have to find a way to bring the intensity that we did in the fourth quarter tonight and carry it on to Game 3."

You dig yourselves a big hole but in the fourth quarter it's there.,"I don't know, I think the fourth quarter we just realize that it's a pride thing then, and we don't want to get blown out.  We're here for a reason, and it becomes a pride thing in the fourth quarter when you're down so many points."

It doesn't matter who it is, the intensity level automatically picks up.  The team is better.  It doesn't matter if it's Detroit or the Spurs.  Every round gets a little harder."

Like I said, I don't -- you give the Spurs a lot of credit, but everyone knows that each round picks up, and the team picks up.  You get better after you win one series.  You get better when you win the Conference Finals and get to The Finals.  You get better as a team, and the intensity definitely picks up."

I can't remember the last time I didn't play 40-plus minutes.  I got two quick fouls and it definitely didn't work in our team's favor.  I wanted to be out there to try to help my team win, and being in early foul trouble definitely hurt us."

What do you think the team's effort was and how do you fix it?,"We can play better.  We can play harder.  It shows, the difference the first three quarters or the first half compared to the second half.  At one point we were shooting 57 percent from the field, and that hasn't been us.  We have to find a way to pick up our intensity and carry on what happened in the fourth quarter into the rest of the game."

Do you have any sense of what you guys can do to keep him out of the paint?,"I don't know (laughing)  you know, he's very good, probably the second best point guard we've played in this postseason.  Jason Kidd is one, I think Tony Parker is two.  No matter what you do he's going to find a way to get into the paint.  He can finish over big guys, finish over small guys.  They have a great one in Tony Parker for sure."

We're a man team, we have to man up and try to keep him out of the paint.  We have to make our best effort.  We made him take a lot of jump shots tonight, which he made.  He made a three.  I think when he's shooting the ball as well as he did tonight there's no way you can stop him."

I mean, he just did so many things tonight to kind of get this victory for him?","He definitely did a great job defensive, came up with a lot of blocked shots, rebounded the ball extremely well on the offensive and defensive rebound.  He's been here before, and it's nothing new to him.  It doesn't matter if he's out there for five minutes or for 25 minutes, he's definitely going to give his best effort, and he was definitely a spark off the bench."

Were you expecting to get it back on that play and make another move, or what was your thinking on that?","Oh, absolutely.  I had been aggressive in the fourth quarter.

I definitely wanted to try to get a good look at it or give my teammate a better look at it, but it was just miscommunication."

I had an offensive foul, but I didn't think that was a foul.  Their defense was definitely good, and they're definitely making me work for everything I do."

It seemed a lot of times coming off the picks that it's there and you're still going left to right when you don't drive.  Do you sense that at all in these three games?,"This is all about them.  They played very good defense.  They played elbows and boxes and if I'm coming off someone that's there and I have to swing the ball to a teammate or I come off a pick-and-roll and they're there again.  It's all about me not trying to force anything and to try to go for it when I can.

I think the Eastern Conference Finals was tough, and I knew it was going to pick up another level.  I think our team senses that, also.  You know, the experience factor, we don't like to make any excuse, but it definitely played a part in this Finals against a world power team in the Spurs."

I think Coach Pop and their defensive staff has put in a great defensive plan against me.  Any little crease I find they're still having guys coming over me, and if I do finish they make me finish over bodies.  I really expect that and I love the challenge.

You know, you're definitely disappointed.  I'm not disappointed in our effort the last two games, not at all.  I think we played well.  We definitely just faced a better team in this series, simple as that."
2007-06-14,46:29,24.0,0.333,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,"Can you just talk about how much you basically have carried this franchise, but you still need help; you can't do everything by yourself?  What needs to be done maybe supporting cast-wise, and did you feel heavy pressure during the series?","I really think the team we have now is good enough to win a championship, and I really stressed that from the beginning.  It just shows we went up against a better team, simple as that.  We went up against a better team in this series, and everybody has to be better coming into next season.  I have to be ten times better.  Our team has to be ten times better.  As individuals, if we all put in the work this summer and come to training camp next year, our level automatically rises."

You know, we gave it all.  We did what we said, made it to the championship, try to win the championship.  We won the Eastern Conference Championship.  We wanted to win the big thing, but when we look back on it, hopefully we can be satisfied, or not satisfied, but happy with what we have done."
2007-06-14,46:29,24.0,0.333,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,Can you just talk about your feelings when you saw the Spurs celebrating on your court and how much of a motivation will that be to have that be your team?,"I didn't.  I didn't want to turn around at all and look at it, but I've seen other teams win the title before, me watching on TV, so I know what they were doing.  But I didn't turn around and look at it (smiling).  I didn't want to look at it."

Now that it's over, was fatigue a factor?","I don't think so.  I felt great throughout the whole season.  Everyone at this point is -- everyone is injured at this point, everyone is a little fatigued.  It's not an excuse.  I definitely felt good coming into this series, and I think the defensive intensity and some of the things they did kept me off guard and kept the team off guard.  The turnovers are uncharacteristic of what happened.  It was a lot of unforced things, me losing the ball or me making bad passes.  It's all things I can control, and I wasn't able to do that."

Me, as an individual, I have to be much better on and off the court, and that will carry our team to higher levels.  I think it starts with me first and then it will trickle down to everybody else."
2007-06-14,46:29,24.0,0.333,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,What did this team learn from this series?,"I'm not sure.  We haven't really talked about it.  You know, we went up against a better team.  We know the Spurs is definitely the better team in this series.  They played like it.  They never got rattled when we made runs.  They never sped up.  They played their own tempo, and they kept us off balance.  I think we learned that as good as we thought we was, there was still a team out there that was better than us."
2007-06-14,46:29,24.0,0.333,6.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0,I saw you entering the pressroom and exchanging some words with Tim Duncan.  I was just wanting to know what you guys were talking about?,"I was just basically congratulating him on a wonderful season, on his championship.  He's definitely a great player and he has a great supporting cast around him.  I think it's great.  If I couldn't do it, why not Tim Duncan?  He's definitely a very good player, and he definitely brings out the best in his teammates.  I think I kind of want to do the same thing and try to do the same thing with my teammates, so we're kind of the same player, me in the perimeter, him in the post."

Two good teams continuing to execute down the stretch. It definitely hurt, but we got to adjust. Like we said before, a series is not won or lost in one game. It is a good start for them. We just have to make adjustments and get ready for Game 2."

Why or why not?",I'm not injured. Just caught a few cramps. That comes from maybe a little bit of dehydration. So I got to make sure I keep my fluids up for the next few days. I'm not hurt.
2009-05-20,41:14,49.0,0.667,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0,Not an ankle?,"Not an ankle, not a knee. I'm fine now. Just sometimes if you ever -- if you ever played sports before and you catch a cramp, your body will tell you when you are ready to move. If you try to move before your body tells you to move, it is going to hurt. I just got to stay a little more hydrated throughout these next few days."

It looks like you had one of the best games in the playoffs.","Well, my statistics don't mean anything when it ends in a loss. If I can do something else to help our team win, I'm going to do that. What I did is try to give us an opportunity to win. I tried to put us in the right position to win. That's all I can do as an individual. But you try to -- you got to find a way to will games away sometimes when they get away or continue with the same energy you had throughout the whole game. Tonight my individual performance means nothing, you know, because we didn't win the game."

He can still see over some of the guards or see over me sometimes when we are blitzing his pick-and-roll. He had to really -- he had a really all-around solid game. He adjusts in the second half, found some things that helped them win the game."
2009-05-20,41:14,49.0,0.667,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, you said, hey, it is a long series and we'll adjust. Take us through that mental process over the next couple days. How do you guys get yourselves in that place for Game 2?",We will prepare just like we do after a win. You make an adjustment. You try to play a little bit harder on the defensive end. For a team shooting 55 percent on our court in a game is unacceptable for all of us. We know that. That's not how we play basketball and that's not how we are going to win. We should have lost giving a team 55 percent from the field. So we are going to make adjustments tomorrow. We are going to watch some film. We are not going to add no more pressure on us than we need to be. Just go out there and play.
2009-05-20,41:14,49.0,0.667,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0,Anything else besides defense that's sticking with you and you want to change for Game 2?,"I mean, offensively we were stagnant at times, maybe because I felt the hot hand. I got back to the one-on-one play that I had in the past. But I felt I had it going individually. But we only had five turnovers as a team. It is not like we were not playing basketball the right way. We missed some really good shots, some easy shots, we made shots. We shot 48 percent from the field offensively, so for the most part that's a pretty good game when you have 19 assists and only 5 turnovers. MO WILLIAMS: I want to add to that last one. I don't think that him going one-on-one was the factor. I think he had it going. That's part of our offense, for him to attack his man. I think the key -- the key -- the biggest key to the game was myself. Myself was the key. I have to take pressure off that guy. I'm looking at the stats and I'm looking at Dwight and I'm looking at Rashard and I'm looking at Hedo, and those three guys was terrific tonight. And I look at myself, 6-19, LeBron is 20-30 from the field. I don't care, he can go one-on-one all he wants. I got 19 shots still. It wasn't him."
2009-05-20,41:14,49.0,0.667,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, could you foresee some change-up in the rotation maybe to get Sasha in for some of the defensive matchups in the next game? And also can you speak to the very last play, to the tip ball, did you guys just draw that up right in the moment? You didn't have a time-out there.","I think Sasha can be really good for us. Mentally if he is in tune with the game plan, he can give us some big minutes. His athleticism, his length, being 6'6"", 6'7"", he can help us. But the last play, Mo wanted the last shot, you know. He told me to tip it to him, he was going to take the last shot. We went with it. Almost went in."
2009-05-20,41:14,49.0,0.667,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, you guys haven't really faced much adversity in this post-season, you do know. Can a little bit of that be good, though?","I think it is always good. Nobody said it was going to be easy. It's one game, and if we just look at it and just one game and we just move on to the next game, then we'll be fine. If we think the world is coming down on our heads, then, you know, we are going to get beat pretty bad in Game 2. So like I said before, we always have been a one game or, you know, one team. That's our attitude. So win, lose or draw, you move on to the next."
2009-05-20,41:14,49.0,0.667,6.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, do you think the cramps, do you think it may have had anything to do with the long layoff?","It may have. Because I caught some cramps, too, before in Game 1 of the Atlanta series with the layoff that we had. You can never simulate practice or scrimmaging during practice because you can't add 20,000 fans, you can't add the lights, you can't add that type of atmosphere. With all the sweating that goes on during the course of the game, the mental and physical pounding that you take throughout the course of a game, it is easy for you to catch cramps. So it has something to do with it."

Just trying to get his guys basically saying you guys need to play a little harder and don't worry about his name, just -- you guys are in the NBA for a reason. I got to just continue with what I got to do to help us win ball games. You guys hear Stan all the time in time-outs, you know how he is. He's funny (smiling)."

Take us through what you talked about in the huddle, what the design was and Delonte is open for the 3.","Rashard hit a big shot. Couldn't believe he took the shot, but that's him. If you look at any other series, if you look at statistics and you guard the stat sheets and know percentages and things like that and guy's tendencies, Orlando, they like to go for the win on the road. Hedo took a 3 in the Philly series with a tie game. And Rashard, you just need a little bit of air space to knock down a 3. The play was drawn up to me to make a play, to go quickly, to give us a chance to get an offensive rebound, and I was able to drive. And my man failed, so it kind of got me off balance. So I drove and seen Mo, I saw one guy guard Mo and Delonte. Just like any other play, any other time, I see that happen, I made the skip to Mo. I know Mo wanted to shoot it bad, but his basketball instinct say if a man comes to you, swing, swing. Delonte, same spot to put us up one, had a good look at it, just didn't fall."

The MVP chants, your fans adoring you, is that something that you will soon forget?","Wow. I mean, the reaction from the fans and the teammates, the loudest it has ever been in this building was the first time I made the playoffs in my third year and we faced Washington and we ran out on the court on that game, the towels was out and it was unbelievable. I had lost my wind as soon as I ran out on the court. Tonight surpassed that by ten times. I mean, it was unbelievable. I mean, you couldn't -- I mean, you couldn't hear anything but just a roar of those 20,000-plus fans. And they deserve it. They deserve it."

Was it perhaps giving the Magic a taste of their own medicine, and was that perhaps your greatest highlight of all times?","The first option was for me to fake up and go for the lob. Two things happened. We had a 16 of Rashard Lewis on Mo, so it was going to be a difficult pass. When I went to go for the lob, Hedo had never been on it. I told Mo, whatever -- whatever it was going to take for me I was going to come get the ball, no matter what happened. If the first, third, second, if all options run, I'm going to come get the ball and I'm going to knock down the shot. It is the biggest shot I have made in my career."

These are the four best teams in the game right now, you know, and they are battling. We are battling. We are going up big and they are making runs. It is going to happen. They are not in our head at all. We don't look at it as that. It is just two really good teams just going at it and having a pretty good series so far."

You know, for others it is very short. I mean, those are -- as a kid, you practice those type of moments, as a kid. As a basketball player, you are sitting in your backyard, you are in the gym and you are five, four, three, two, one (buzzer sound). Those are the moments that as kids -- you don't have to be in the NBA to know what I'm talking about. Everybody know those type of moments. And to hit a shot like that at the buzzer at home, wow."

We ran it one time earlier in the season in Indiana right before the All-Star break, and I was able to get a foul on Danny Granger. Rashard Lewis played it perfect. He stood tall, got in Mo's way and dropped it. If you watch the replay, Rashard Lewis even got a contest on the shot when I got up, but just a little bit too late. I mean, they played it perfect. It is just a good shot. It is a good shot. (Smiling). The same way we guard Rashard, when Rashard hit that 3, we guarded it perfect. Good players or great players just make good shots, man."

Would you put one ahead of the other?","I wouldn't say put one ahead of the other. That was a great performance also from us as a team, from me as an individual. Tonight was another good performance by me as an individual and us as a team. That's a shot that you will see for a long time, you know? You watch classic games and you see Jordan hit game winners and you go all the way back, Jerry West hitting game winners, and Mattie Johnson going across the lane and hitting the jump hook against Boston. You see all these type of shots, man, always be played even when the game has left you as an individual. Hopefully I can stick my foot in that category with Magic and Jerry West and Jordan and all these other guys that made spectacular plays on the biggest stage in the world."

Have you already or will you at some point take stock of that shot in terms of what it does for, you know, your career?","It's something I will probably do after I'm done playing the game of basketball, man. I don't take time to look at what I do as an individual while I'm still playing this team game. When I'm done and retired and I'm gone away from the game, I'm by myself, my family, my kids, I can look back on what I did as an individual. As long as I have 14 teammates, I will never look upon what I do as an individual. That's not how I approach the game."

As you are watching it and Mo answered, too, was it in either of your minds that was going in? Can you tell when you released it was going in and did you think it was?","Honest answer, when I caught it square, it felt great. It was in the air, it even looked like it was going in. But the breaks we have been getting so far -- MO WILLIAMS: Oh, oh, my God. LeBRON JAMES: There was a great chance it wasn't going in. Hedo hit a tough shot over Sasha to take the lead. It was -- I just didn't know. I mean, it was like, you know -- I didn't pray as much as Mo did. (Smiling). MO WILLIAMS: I was praying. LeBRON JAMES: It felt great. It felt great. If it came out -- it is possible I could have missed that, too. But it felt great. I practice those type of things, man. You guys see me every day. You guys see me after the practice. I'm catching, shooting things that may not happen in a game, but, you know, it happened tonight."

No. As a kid, you wouldn't leave the gym until you made it, though. As a kid, you would do the five, four, three, two, one. And if you missed 20 in a row, you wasn't allowed to leave the gym until you finally made that shot. I was always Jordan when I made that shot, because in my era growing up Mike was always the one who made those five-to-one game winners, the light goes off and the crowd goes crazy. I wanted to be Mike when I did those things. I got that out of my bag of Michael Jordan tricks, I guess."

It seemed like this is one of the most challenging series you are going to have. What do you think you guys have to do in order to get ahold of these next couple games? What modifications do you have to make to the offense or defense?,"The first thing we need to do is realize that we are not going to blow this team out. When we get leads and they make a run, we just can't get down on ourselves. We have to continue to play. The best thing Orlando has, they have matchup -- they have matchup problems. They create matchup problems with Rashard being at the four, they create matchup players. Very good player, very talented. We have to understand that every possession matters. We cannot take a possession off, and if we have a scheme, we cannot break down because every time you break down against a really good team, they make you play. Just like we would do if a team breaks down against us, we are ready to hit the road. It has been a while. We look forward to it."

Are you starting to feel a little fatigued within the fourth quarters because of the physical nature of this series?,"No. You just try to do anything and everything possible to try to help your team win. At this point everybody is fatigued. There is no -- there is no room for excuses at this point in the season. I mean, everybody is fatigued at this point in the season. There is no way you can hide away from it because of the intensity of the playoffs, the magnitude of the games, the possessions of the games, and the two teams trying to compete to move on to the next level. Fatigue is within everybody who approaches the game."

And how is that manifesting itself on the court?","I think -- we just got to man up a little bit and take responsibility of who you are guarding. We have done it all year, and guarding the guys in front of us and then rely on help second. That's a very, very good team. A lot of credit to the Orlando Magic because it is a very good team. Take nothing away from them."
2009-05-24,41:57,41.0,0.393,7.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,Do you guys feel like -- you personally feel like you have gone back in time two years with the struggles you have had from getting your guys to help you out?,"Well, we've had a few games this season where if no one is making shots then we don't look that good of a team. We've had -- we are a very good shooting team, but we've not found a way to find our stroke. I hope -- and I think we will. Guys are going to be confident about every shot that they take. And if they don't, they think about making the next one."
2009-05-24,41:57,41.0,0.393,7.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,Mo talked at length about the matchup problems Orlando presents to you guys. You said something about that after the big loss here in March. Are you guys struggling to find an answer to the matchup problems that Hedo and Rashard present to you?,"At this point, we are. They create a lot of matchup problems. The way Rashard spaces the floor, our bigs are not used to it. I think our bigs will do a good job of continuing to watch film and find a way to stay out on the perimeter with Rashard. They do -- they got some very big players that can shoot the ball. Also, they can drive, too, if you close out on them a lot. They have done a good job of exploiting that. We run out their shooters, they go around us. If we don't, they stop and shoot the 3. They have done a good job, and their coach has prepared them the right way."
2009-05-24,41:57,41.0,0.393,7.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,Can you tell me how Pietrus is guarding you? And is he making it difficult for you when he is in the game?,"He is a very active player. But, I mean, coming into this game I was shooting 60 percent from the field. So, you know, I missed a few shots tonight I'm capable of making. He is a very active defender, but I don't believe anybody is an individual that can guard me."

Talk about that type of game where there are that many dead balls, stops, that many free throws.","Every time we got it close, there is a whistle blown. I think the refs did a great job tonight. There was a few of them we thought was a little ticky-tack, but, hey, it happens throughout the course of a game. I mean, you look at it and they shoot 51 free throws, and Hedo went 1-11 from the field and but he goes to the line 12 times and makes 11 of them. That's very difficult to guard. When a good shooting team like they are go to the free throw, Dwight goes to the free throw a lot, we can live with that. But we can't allow Hedo to go to the line 12 times and Pietrus come off the bench and go to the line seven times. It is not helping our cause."

I mean, you shot 38 percent and really didn't have --","We are missing some very easy shots, shots that we've always made and continue to make throughout the playoffs and throughout the regular season. I don't think it is the matchup problems on the offensive end."

How confident are you that you can turn it around in this series?,"We're very confident. I know I am as an individual. I make sure our team is. We will get ready for Game 4 and play the same intensity basketball that we played tonight. Hopefully a few shots can go in and a few of theirs can go out. So it is a very good team. Like I said, give them a lot of credit."

The foul was called and he continued to swing his elbows. I mean -- I mean, you see Mo's face. It wasn't a pretty sight. It is not called for in this game. Is that it? Thanks. End of FastScripts"

It looked like you were -- it looked like you were looking to distribute the ball.","I think the guys really knew that they had to play well for us to have a chance in this game tonight. Those guys definitely made shots the whole first half, and it was good to see that. Mo definitely put a lot of pressure on himself and he played well. And I think our bench came in in the first half and gave us a great lift."

What can you guys do differently to close out these games to help you all out?,"We just got to continue to play hard, man. We've had -- we've lost two games off inbound plays. And being up two in Game 1, being up one, you know, tonight, and we've lost two games off inbound plays. So we got to be more in tune in our inbound plays. You got to communicate during that situation and not give up open shots or good looks down the stretch like that."

And before that did you tell Mo, like in Game 2, definitely come to me?","Of course I want the shot, man. I always feel like I can make any shot that I take. As it traveled, it didn't look good. It felt good leaving my hand but didn't look good in the air. Those are the breaks we have gotten this series, man. It just didn't go."

So we weren't able to get it at half court because we had to use our last time-out before I hit the 3 before that play. So it didn't go -- you know, I didn't go back to Game 2 and review it in my mind. I was just hoping that I could make one more."

And I think in that instance, if he got dunks, we got to try to wrap him up and try to foul him and make two free throws. I think Dwight has done a great job of making his free throws. But, you know, statistically he might miss one. And we know he ain't going to miss no dunks or no lay-ups. We got to foul him in those situations, especially in a close game like that."

We are giving ourselves a chance, and we are breaking down in areas that we haven't broke down all year. It is a great three-point shooting team. We got to give up something. I mean, Dwight is playing well, and he's a beast down the middle. So you try to shrink the floor. We open it up to their shooters, and then Dwight continues to get dunks and lay-ups. But we are executing on the other end. We need one stop. We haven't got one stop to win a ball game yet."

This is the best I felt during the post-season in my NBA career. So fatigue hasn't played a factor. I continue to try to help our team, put our team in a position to win ball games. The ball is in my hand a lot, and I may have a few turnovers. That happens. But I have to figure out how to not have eight. Eight is unacceptable for me. That's way over what I've done throughout the whole playoffs or throughout this series. I won't turn the ball over as much. Some of them is just misqueue, some of them is just trying to make the right play. But fatigue has nothing to do with it."
2009-05-26,49:24,44.0,0.448,12.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,5.0,0,"Given how the season has gone for you guys, how the playoffs went, find yourself down three games, put it in perspective. How do you guys deal with this?","Well, you deal with it, move on to the next game. We had our chances tonight. And we didn't execute. You move on to the next game. You try to get the game on Thursday back home and come back down here and try to get Game 6. We are looking forward to the challenge. I know I am. I'm up for the challenge, and I think my play, my leadership has spoke for that. So I will be ready, and I think our guys will be ready also."

In your mind, did you have something else you wanted to try to do?","We had another play called. But I was doubled at the time-out. Courtney Lee played under and Pietrus played right behind. So by any means, I went to go get the ball. That's the shot I can definitely make from that range. Just didn't go."

Did you not have a good shot at a 3?","If I was Rashard Lewis, we would have won. I would have took the 3. But me being who I am, I took the two and got fouled and went up there and made two free throws. End of FastScripts"

What did you guys do tonight to win by at least ten points?","We covered the three-point line really well today. They killed us from the three-point line last game making, 17 3s, and the whole just great shooting team is 32 percent from the three-point line was to our benefit. We had a conscious effort of getting out to their shooters. If they were going to make some, they were going to make it over a contested hand. It worked to our benefit."

But the one thing I liked about it, you got back to getting stops at crucial times in the fourth quarter. How big was that?","That's what we make our mark at, man. We got to find a way to get stops down the stretch. We haven't done that throughout this series until tonight. In Game 1 we gave up a 3 to Rashard Lewis when we was up two. In Game 4 we give up another 3 to Rashard Lewis. That's when we made our mark at it all season, man, by just clamping down in crucial situations throughout the course of a season and throughout the course of a game, especially in the fourth quarter. We finally did that tonight."
2009-05-28,45:30,37.0,0.458,14.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you had a streak in the fourth quarter where you were either making or assisting on every field goal. What were you doing to facilitate out there?","Just take what the defense give me. When my guys make shots, it makes it a lot easier on myself because they're -- now it allows me to go one-on-one with a defender. They can't help as much. And when they did help, they knocked down three-point shots and Andy got a one-handed layup. That's what I need from my guys. I don't add no more pressure on my teammates, but they know we're a very strong team when they knock down shots."

Talk about your mental approach in the fourth quarter and what was going through your head.,"Just close out. We was down one to start the fourth and I knew coach was just going to -- it was win or go home at this point, so I knew I was going to play the whole fourth. Just wanted to -- my guys, they had made shots through the first three quarters, so I knew it was going to be an opportunity for me to probably press the gas a little bit on the offensive end. And they continued to make shots in the fourth. I always feel like myself individually I can always get going any part of the game."
2009-05-28,45:30,37.0,0.458,14.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you were able to get the ball a lot in the fourth quarter right at the top of the key, having not used a dribble yet. Is that something fairly new you put in? And what advantage is it for you to have that where you can already shoot the ball or do what you want?","That's key. Something that as a unit players and coaches we came up with, trying to figure out a way we can try to exploit their defense with all our shooters out there. And having a live dribble either at the top of the key or free-throw line is key for myself and for our team because now it adds a threat of me jabbing, jabbing, taking a shot or getting to the paint and either taking a shot for myself or creating for my teammates. So any time you are as dangerous as I am or the best guys in this League and you have a live dribble, it makes you that much more dangerous because they don't know what you are going to do."
2009-05-28,45:30,37.0,0.458,14.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you guys offensively, how much of a conscious effort did y'all make to make sure the ball kept moving rather than it getting stagnant and you kind of doing everything?","That was huge. I mean, that defense is very good when you allow the ball to just stay on one side and you just dribble and dribble and now you are getting down to five seconds on the shot clock and now you got to try to race and get up a good shot. By Mo and Delonte and also Daniel coming and pushing the ball up the court and getting us into our sets early, it allows us now to be comfortable with now attacking it with ten on the shot clock instead of five. Getting the ball moving against this team is key."

What do you have to do defensively on a guy like Hedo to really keep him from dictating action?","Hedo is an all-star in my mind. You look at their team, you can say they have four all-stars with injured Jameer and Rashard and Dwight. Hedo is -- him and Rashard, they are clutch players they have. Just try to take the challenge. At this point it's -- you got to just take the challenge, man. Especially when you are on your last leg, you just got to take the challenge, and I did that."
2009-05-28,45:30,37.0,0.458,14.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"Dwight fouled out again tonight. You stated before the series began that you were still going to try to take it to him. Has that been the one consistent factor that you continue to have success, taking it right to him?","That's what I do. I attack no matter who is in the paint. No matter what's going on, I just try to attack. Even though I know he is a defensive player of the year, you just got to try to attack a guy like that, man. He is very good with space. If you allow a guy like that to get space, then he is able to jump and create and block shots. That's how he gets a lot of his weak side blocks and coming across and blocking shots. If you don't give him much space, you hit him, make contact with him, it is tough for a guy like that to get off the court."

They just made a run and we weren't able to slow it down. They just caught us off guard. At this time, either you win or you chill at the house, you are playing with the kids a lot. You sit back and watch the finals. Something I envisioned. I signed up to play for a long time in the series and this season. There is always a sense urgency when you are on the brink of elimination.

Describe what you were seeing out there.","I was seeing two defenders all night. Two or three defenders. I came into the game knowing that they were going to try to load up on myself and D-Wade. So I just changed my game plan tonight, be more of a facilitator. If I needed to get it going offensively, I could. The great thing about it CB had it going. When we have someone going on our team, we continue to give the ball to him and continue to feed off their energy offensively. And he brought it home for us tonight."

We have a system, and we make adjustments at times. But we stick to our guns. We know defensively when we're active and guys are on the string and if one guy gets beat, another guy is there to help him, we're very good. So Derrick Rose is a great player. He's going to find creases. He's going to get his shots. That's what great players do. We try to make it tough for him. Try to make it tough for not only him but his teammates, also, make them take tough contested shots. It's a long series still. Through three games we found a way to just play our defense and not dictate our defense on what they do. We just play our game."

Can you talk about the point guard play tonight.","They were great tonight. Bibby knocking down two huge threes for us in the third. And I think 'Rio (Chalmers) coming in and having his hand. He also got a strip, a big steal for us. He was solid. Derrick Rose is a great player. Our point guards just try to stay in front of him as much as possible, trying to contain him. They're doing a great job so far. Our point guards are very key to our team. When they play big and make shots and also defend like they are doing, we're a pretty good team."

How big is Tuesday?,"I mean, I think they're looking at it how we looked at it after Game 1, saying if we can walk out of here with a split, then we feel comfortable going home. That's what they're thinking. Coming into our home building, we have to continue to give our fans what they want. That's wins. We come in with the same mindset as we had Game 2 and Game 3. Defending, executing offensively, we give ourselves a good chance. It's a very good rebounding team. We've done a great job of just trying to lower those offensive rebounds and second-chance points each game from Game 1 to Game 2 to tonight. And if we do that, we give ourselves a good chance. We're looking forward to it."

You had to hit the deck to get it, saved it to Haslem, he hit the deck. Describe that play from your vantage point and describe it. You had been playing 45, 48 minutes to that point. How much did you have left?","First you missed the block on that play. D-Wade coming weak side and getting that block. It's whatever it takes at that point. Joakim got a hand on it. I wanted to try to fight him as much as possible. I was able to strip the ball away from him. Dove on the ball. The ball was headed out of bounds. Once I tipped it and I saw it rolling and I saw UD, I already knew we had the ball. Nobody is going to take the ball from him. That was just a great all-around team possession for us. It came at a big moment in the game in overtime."

And what's it like, you're out there, it's a really tough defensive game, and all of a sudden guys are making really spectacular plays and the level of play just seems like it's going up?","First of all, the two dunks were great. There's no point guard in our league I think -- besides, you have Russell Westbrook, he makes plays like that. But D-Rose on the break, he goes to a jump-stop and finish it with an and-one and then he breaks down our defense, split pick-and-roll and he gets in there against probably our best shot-blocker in Joel Anthony, and dunks the ball for an and-one. He's a special player. Those plays are spectacular. That's why he is who he is. What was the second question?"
2011-05-24,49:23,35.0,0.423,6.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, can you talk about defending Derrick on the last play of regulation and just defending him in general for the last quarter and overtime.","With a player like that, you just try to keep him out of the paint as best as you can. He was attacking our defense a lot, getting to the free-throw line. The last shot all you could do is contest. There's not too many guys that are going to block his shot on the jumpshot. But I just tried to make it hard on him, get the contest. I made him take a tough one. As far as guarding him throughout the game, I take pride defensively. It doesn't matter who it is, if it's Derrick Rose or starting off on Luol, it's whatever it takes for myself and for our team. If that means me playing extensive minutes guarding D-Rose, then I'll do it. I don't have a problem with that. I play both sides of the floor. I love defense much more than I do offensively. I just take pride on that side of the floor. We were able to get enough stops. It's great when you have guys behind you that also love to play defense, also. So you know you got help if you get beat. I got beat on the baseline, D-Wade got the spectacular block. So you take pride on that side of the floor and it pays off for you."

We know in order for us to win basketball games we have to get stops and we have to play at a high level. That's all we're about. We know offensively -- at times we have rough stretches where we don't score, but we give ourselves a great chance to win every game because we defend. And that's what it's about."

We're going to every game saying it's a must-win for us. We take it upon that challenge, going back into the madhouse. We know it's going to be extremely loud. They're going to feed off their fans. We're going to try to play as desperate as we've played the last three games. It's been since '06 for D-Wade, '07 for myself since we've been to The Finals and it's one game away. We're not taking anything for granted. We're just continuing to play our game and take one game at a time. It starts with Game 5."

Just talk about his importance as a friendship you have.","We have a family bond. Drake has always been supportive of myself, and everything that he do I'm a supporter of his. So it goes beyond what you guys see at the game. We talk on a regular -- everything, about family and everything. What we have is a real family. It's not just because we are successful what we do. We really care about one another on a day-to-day basis. Anytime you get a friend that can come and support you in what you do, I really respect that. He has a busy schedule. I respect that.

I know he's had a tough year with the injuries and everything else he's had to deal with.","Absolutely. Tonight he just played free. Everything that he gave us tonight was what we always expected out of him. He didn't think about it tonight. Every time he caught the ball -- what we've been telling him all year, ""when you catch the ball, just shoot it."" He's probably the only guy on our team that can shoot any shot he wants to. Even me, D-Wade and CB, Coach gets on us sometimes if we take ill-advised shots and things like that. Mike Miller is a guy who can shoot any shot he wants. Tonight he did that. He caught the ball, he shot threes, made a pull-up, and then what he's always been doing when he gets minutes, he rebounds the ball extremely well. He had nine rebounds for us and they were all key. Like I said before, that lineup we talked about this summer, myself and D-Wade and CB, Udonis and Mike is something we always envisioned, and it's coming together at the right time."

Like they were playing more to not to lose rather than to win?,"No, we've just seen our body language change. Me and D-Wade said we want to watch the last four minutes of the game and see exactly what happened. We don't honestly know what happened. We know some big plays happened, and we know we won the game. It went so fast. Our body language changed, once we got stops and finally made a few shots. I have to give a lot of credit to Chicago, Coach Thibs, D-Rose and the rest of those guys. That defense we faced this round is tremendous. Like I said, coming -- I said it coming into this series, this was going to be an offensive struggle for both teams. That's exactly what it was. We both, Chicago and us, we both pride on the defensive end. You know, once we made a few shots, we felt like we could get stops in the fourth quarter. That's what we build on. We build on getting fourth quarter stops. D-Wade made some unbelievable plays. Got an and-one on transition on D-Rose. Got a four-point play. I was able to make a few shots and we continued to get stops."

I've been in situations where I say why me at this point? But you have to keep working and be put in those positions time after time after time where if you fail, you have to be ready to take that challenge again and again and again. When you're a leader, D-Rose -- he earned the MVP. He's a great talent, unbelievable player. Chicago got a great -- not only a great basketball player, but a great kid, too. What he's done for this city and what he's done for this franchise in just three years is remarkable. The sky is the limit for that guy. I mean, wow, as a fan, he's going to get better and better. Hopefully we don't have to continue to see him in the postseason. DWYANE WADE: We will. LeBRON JAMES: Yeah, we will."
2011-05-26,45:46,28.0,0.421,11.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, at what point did you refine yourself late in the games or was it a feel you had in the postseason?","It's not refine, it's just being put in those positions. I never lost confidence in my ability. I know what I'm capable of. My teammates never lost confidence in me either. That's the huge thing. When your teammates continue to look at you down the stretch and say, we need you to bring this game home for us, we need you to make plays offensively and defensively, you never lose confidence in yourself, too. This postseason has been a good run for myself as far as being able to close games. But I've done it in the past. It's just the thing when you fail in late-game situations, those are the ones that people remember. They don't even remember the ones when you do well. I just got to keep being put in those situations, like I said, and not be afraid to fail."
2011-05-26,45:46,28.0,0.421,11.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,"LeBron and Dwyane, just being at this point, after what happened last summer with all the expectations, how does it feel? What's it like? Is it a sense of relief? Or how would you describe it right now?","It's no sense of relief right now. We still have work to do. Like I said, we will look at this moment tonight, have a little bit of time tomorrow to go over this moment, what we just accomplished, but we get ready for Dallas very soon. We don't take for granted this win and take for granted being the Eastern Conference champs. We're not going to take that for granted. There's a lot of teams, 15 teams in the Eastern Conference that set out to do the same thing starting the season. But we have a lot of work to do still. We look forward to the challenge once the Finals begin on Tuesday."
2011-05-26,45:46,28.0,0.421,11.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, your three-point shooting has improved over the years. For what you've done in the last minutes of the last couple of rounds, is it just something you've grown into? Or did you feel like you were really shooting it well coming into the playoffs, that and your free-throw shooting?","I guess it's work, first of all. Putting the extra hours of work. Me and D-Wade always, for the most part, we stay after, get shots. Late-night get shots. Just trying to work on our craft to get better for our teammates. Not only for ourselves, but for our teammates to come through in situations like that. When you have confidence in your ability to go out there and perform, that helps. Being put in those positions help. Like I said before, when you have the confidence from your teammates to take those shots, or even when you miss, they still look at you like we want you to take those shots again. We have that confidence coming from the other 13 guys in our locker room. For myself, just stepping up. Just stepping up for this team and trying to do whatever it takes to win. And if that's making a big shot late in the game or if that's trying to get a defensive stop, I try to take the challenge."
2011-05-26,45:46,28.0,0.421,11.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,Is it something technical?,Nothing technical. Just repetition.
2011-05-26,45:46,28.0,0.421,11.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, when you see this surge in interest, year-long interest, since you went to Miami, so much of it, whether people are hating or loving you, it has to do a lot with you, how do you feel about that?","I understand a lot of the backlash that came with me going to Miami, but I understand also that I did what was best for me, what was best for my family and what was best for me being a professional athlete. I understand what this league is all about. I wanted to team up with some guys that I understood that would never die down in the moment. The opportunity presented itself with this great organization, and D-Wade came to me and said it was possible. We made it happen. You know, I'm happy. In anyone's job, they always try to find some way they can do their job and be happy doing it. And that's where I am right now in my life, as far as on the court and off the court. I just keep on -- I'm trying to get better every day. Not only as a basketball player, but as a father, as a friend. All the above, I guess."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, in the Chicago series Erik said you asked to be on Rose in the fourth quarter. Was that the same case tonight with Terry?","No, I mean whatever. Whatever it takes for our team. You know, if I need to be on Terry or anyone on their team, I try to take the challenge. Our defense is pretty good. It's never me just guarding someone individually. But I do take the challenge on any individual matchup that I'm against. And tonight happened to be Terry mostly in the second half."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, you guys fell behind by eight early in the third. You called a timeout and they only scored a few points in the next three and a half minutes. What changed defensively?","We needed to lock in. We came out in the third quarter not paying attention to detail. Gave them an open three. DeShawn Stevenson hit an open three. Dirk hit an open shot at the top of the key. We just weren't paying attention to detail about how we were going to defend this team coming into the game. Once we slowed down and got back into what we know, what our strong point is, and that's getting stops, we were able to get out, D-Wade was able to get an and-one. Make another shot and we made a run."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, what goes through your mind as you go into these fourth quarters of games, especially these key games?","Defense. I think in order for us to win basketball games, we have to defend and we have to get stops, and our offense will speak for itself when we continue to get stops. I think for me going into the fourth quarter, I know it's winning time. That's when the game is won. So I got to try to dominate my individual matchup defensively, and then try to execute as best as possible. Try to get good looks, not turn the ball over. And we did a good job of doing that tonight. We got stops and we executed on the offensive end."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"Your first Finals victory, how much different does this one feel? Obviously you guys still have a lot of work left to do? How does this feel from 2007 when you were frustrated for four games?","D-Wade said that to me. Congratulated me after the game on my first Finals victory. I mean, it feels good because it's the first game. And we played well as a team. We got a lot of work to do. We'll come in with the same mindset on Thursday, and looking forward to this challenge once again that's in front of us. It's one in the books. We're excited about this game. Tomorrow we prepare for Game 2, and obviously there's ways we can get better."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"38% overall, 45% from three, what were they giving you guys?","They play a lot of zone, and the zone is to pack the paint, keep our drivers out of the paint, myself and D-Wade. And dare us to shoot threes. I think our bench came in and did a great job, Rio (Chalmers), Mike Miller did a great job against that zone, knocking shots down. We needed that boost off the bench. We know how strong their bench is, and our bench matched them tonight. And they played extremely well. When they were in the zone, they knocked down shots. Rio gave us a big boost. Mike Miller gave us a big boost, and everyone contributed."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, with the rhythm you seem to be in on the threes lately, is the idea you can be defended by making you shoot, like San Antonio did a couple of years ago, is that gone forever now?","Pretty much. Yeah, dare me to shoot, that's pretty much gone. I think people will still live with keeping myself and keeping D-Wade on the perimeter, but it's just my confidence. I put a lot of hard work into it, and understanding that you got to be a two-way player in this league. You have to be able to shoot the ball, you have to be able to drive and do other things to not only get yourself involved, but get your teammates involved. Tonight once again I shot the ball extremely well from the outside, but more importantly, it helped our team get a win. That's what it's all about."
2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,"You know, if a player has been in the Super Bowl before, even if he's the backup fullback on a team, you might tell the quarterback it's a little different. We've been in a big game. We're experienced. I want to know did Dwyane or even Udonis tell you, LeBron, anything about this being The Finals and it being different? Or was that left unsaid?","I think it was left unsaid. They understand I've been in some big games. I've been in the Finals. Didn't win a ballgame in '07, but I've been in big games before. So basically it's the same conversation we had before every game. Let's get ready to go out and continue to improve as a team, as individuals, and help lead this team to a victory."

2011-05-31,45:15,24.0,0.563,9.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1,Dirk.,He's right-handed. He'll be all right.
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"Guys, Dwyane, when you hit the three to go up 15, LeBron, you kind of started the celebration right in front of the Mavs' bench, which turned into a kind of synchronized handshake in front of the Mavs' bench. Some of the Mavs players mentioned that may have been the turning tide. What were your thoughts on how that all went down?","It was no celebration at all. I was excited about the fact that he hit a big shot, and we went up 15. The same thing we've done over the course of the season. There was no celebration at all. We knew we had seven minutes to go still to close out the game. As far as celebration, that word has been used with us all year. But we knew how much time was left in the game still."
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, you guys seemed to be pounding the ball a bunch at the end instead of running through the offense that got you to that point. Was there a sense sometimes that you felt you can run enough clock and it would end or did you get out of what had been working?","I think offensively we just weren't in a good rhythm. But it's not even -- offensively we've been out of rhythm before. At the end of the day, we hang our hats on our defense. I think they were 1-for-10 the first four or five minutes in the first part of the fourth quarter. It was 88-73; end up scoring 22 points in the last seven minutes. They only scored 24 in the whole fourth. We're up 15. If they go on a 12-0 run for the rest of the game, if we don't score another basket, we still win by three. Defensively we just have to be more in tune and not allow a great team, a great offensive team to get as many great looks as they did down the stretch. Jason Kidd had an open three. Jason Terry had a leak-out lay-up. He also had a corner jumper. Dirk 90/90 he hit a wide-open three. That's not our defense at all. We have to do a better job and be more in tune."
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"Can you talk about the difference in your mindset from going up with a 2-0 lead, where they have to win four of the last five, to suddenly the series is even, they've regained home-court advantage, and you're going there for the next three?","It's a different mindset, of course. It's a ballgame now. With the series tied 1-1, we're looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be a difficult challenge for us but we're looking forward to it. We're a confident bunch. We play great on the road. It's going to be a hostile environment. Their fans and team are going to bring everything they have. We have to come out with it all. Play as close to 48 minutes as possible on both ends."
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"For two guys who pride yourselves on defense as much as you guys do, to lose in this particular way, does that get your competitive juices or affect you in a different way than another loss?","It's not going to affect us for Game 3. It hurts right now because it's right now. We're competitors. We want to win the game. We feel like we have a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, that our defense will prevail. That's how much confidence we have in our defense. It hurts now, but we'll be fine. I don't feel like our confidence will be down going into Game 3. We'll be back to square one and figure out how to win the game."
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, one last thing about the celebration thing: Do you think maybe it's a bigger issue because it happened right in front of their bench, in their personal kind of space, maybe that's why it's a bigger deal than just a normal celebration?","No, I don't think it's an issue."
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"Dwyane and LeBron, both of you, a lot was made of Dirk and his left hand during the week. He finished two of the last three baskets at the rim with his left hand. Can you comment on his ability to go to his off hand when he was hurt at the end of the game when it mattered most?","We were asked about it after Game 1, I said it would be a non-issue. He's a great scorer. He understands he can use both hands. He got the left-hand lay-up to tie the game up at 90, and then the game-winner going left once again. So as you can tell, it has no effect on his left hand at all, if any."
2011-06-02,39:37,20.0,0.533,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, it seemed like the Mavs were trapping you pretty hard coming off screens there at the end of the fourth quarter. Was that differently than they played you the rest of the game? And if not, what exactly bogged down your offense?","They did. They did a great job of playing two on the ball. They used Tyson Chandler to come off pick-and-rolls, Tyson Chandler or Dirk. They blitzed me and D-Wade's pick-and-roll. Something different. Something we can go to the film to figure out how to exploit that or do a better job of executing later in the game. They didn't do that till the fourth quarter. They picked up the aggression and it got us out of the flow of the offense where we were taking shots at the end of the shot clock. I know I took a few fadeaway threes at the end of the shot clock because we couldn't get into our offense. It's something we'll work on and be better on in Game 3. THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

2011-06-05,45:15,17.0,0.429,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, we've seen you keep going at guys even if they're having cold shooting nights. Describe that mentality in particular as applied to Bosh tonight, wasn't having a great night and the game on the line, you gave him the ball.","It's all about trusting your teammates. D-Wade, we ran a two-three pick-and-roll. They put two on the ball. D-Wade hit me first. I had Tyson Chandler closing on me. I saw CB wide open. I don't care if he missed 15 in a row, he was wide open and that's his sweet spot. He was able to knock it down. It's the trust we have in each other's ability, no matter what the point of the game is at."
2011-06-05,45:15,17.0,0.429,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"For both you guys, a lot of what the Mavericks do starts on the perimeter a long ways from the basket. Seemed like tonight you pushed farther and farther out to make what they were doing at the beginning of plays tougher and you created a lot of turnovers on the perimeter. Is that because you don't have a fear of what happens against this team closer to the basket? Does that make sense? Are they so perimeter-driven by how they run their offense and shooting so many jumpshots that it makes it easier on you guys to take chances out high?","It's not even that. We play our defense. This is the toughest offense we've played all year as far as how many guys they put on the floor that can make plays. Not only for themselves, but for others. Unbelievable shooting team. And they make you stay in tune. You can never relax or they make you pay. Our defense always tries to extend offenses further than where they usually start. That's just our defense. It has nothing to do about them not being a paint presence or anything like that. It's just our defense. That's how we played all postseason all year."
2011-06-05,45:15,17.0,0.429,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, three games in a row for you fourth quarter, not much. That's the moment superstars become superstars. Seems like you are almost shrinking from it. What's going on?","I think you're concentrating on one side of the floor. All you're looking at is the stat sheet. Honestly, I'm a two-way player. Since D-Wade had it going offensively, so we allow him to handle the ball, bring it on offensively. You should watch the film again and see what I did defensively. You'll ask me a better question tomorrow."
2011-06-05,45:15,17.0,0.429,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what did you think when you saw it?","Like D-Wade said, we had all the confidence in the world in our defensive scheme. UD wanted that matchup in Game 2. So we knew when he got this matchup, he was going to make Dirk take a tough shot. He made that shot before. He will make it again. At least we just make him work for it. Make him take a turn-around jumper. UD stayed in front of him and it rimmed out. It was a huge stop for our team."
2011-06-05,45:15,17.0,0.429,3.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, it doesn't seem like there have been many teammates who feel empowered enough to do that. What's that moment like and what's it like having a teammate that, heck, at this moment I'm going to tell you what I need to tell you whether you're LeBron James or just the 12th guy on the roster?","It's just we're teammates. At this point there's no room to hold anything back. There's nine or eight days left in the season. I think our friendship allows us to don't care about that moment. It's living in the moment. That situation he had every right to say what he had to say to me. As a competitor, you love when guys challenge you. He challenged me in the locker room at halftime. He challenged me on the court. As a competitor, like I said, I respect that."

I got to do a better job of being more assertive offensively, not staying out of rhythm offensively the whole game. But I think one thing I try to concentrate is, if I get two guys on me, try to make my teammates better, hit those guys for open looks. They made some great looks, but at the same time I have to keep myself in rhythm while I'm doing that as well."
2011-06-07,45:43,8.0,0.273,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, in the last series when Dwyane said he felt his shot was out of rhythm, he came to the gym extra and shot. What are some of the things you're going to do over the next day and a half to be a better player in Game 5?","You know, with these games, every other day, there's not much gym time you can have. You want to try to stay off your feet as much as possible. If I feel like I need to come to the gym and get some extra shots up, I will. Absolutely just to get my shot back going and my confidence with my shot going. If I feel I need to do that after practice, tomorrow night I will do that."
2011-06-07,45:43,8.0,0.273,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0,Where do you feel your confidence is with your shot right now?,"I'm confident with my ability. It's about going out there and knocking them down. When you have the opportunity, you have to knock them down. Your teammates give you the confidence. They give me the confidence all year, all postseason. So I have to go out there and make them count."
2011-06-07,45:43,8.0,0.273,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, you guys had a commanding lead in the fourth. You guys would have gone up 3-1. Mavericks had nothing going. Shooting a low percentage. Dirk was sick. How do you think you guys ended up losing this game? What happened?","I don't think anything is commanding in this series. These are two games teams trying to figure out a way to make plays down the stretch. We've seen in this series seven or eight-point lead is nothing. You just got to continue to execute offensively, continue to grind defensively. And put yourself in the best possible chance to win late."
2011-06-07,45:43,8.0,0.273,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, what were they specifically showing you defensively that didn't let you get going offensively?","I think they haven't changed their coverages on me. Me just being more assertive, that's what it's about. I got the ball in the post a few times, and I seen double-teams. I tried to kick it out to guys and they've made shots for us. At the same time I can't let that stop my aggression when they bring two on the ball. I still got to make plays for my team, but also make plays for myself to keep me in the rhythm of the game."

What's the emotion right now? Is it anger? Is it frustration? Is it letting it go? Is it some combination? How can you sum up what's going through you right now?","I think the fact that it happened in a loss is the anger part about it. That's all that matters to me. If I had had eight points and we won the game, I could be satisfied. I don't really care about that. The fact I could have did more offensively to help our team, that's the anger part about it, and myself. I'll come back in Game 5 and do things that needs to be done to help our team win."

How will it inspire you to come back even stronger with more of a vengeance?","We've always been a good bounce-back team. Anytime we have a loss or we feel like we could have did better in one game, we've always been able to bounce back. Individuals have been able to bounce back, including myself, D-Wade and CB and the guys. We understand it's a golden opportunity. Game 5 we come here and we play as well as we did tonight, we execute a little better down the stretch, we give ourselves a good chance to win Game 5 and go home and be able to close out."

When he plays well, Dallas plays well. He's the reason why these guys are in The Finals and that's the reason why he's been one of the top guys and Sixth Man Award every year, because he plays well for this team. It's a good show tonight by both teams. They made one or two more plays down the stretch than we did. We look forward to Game 5, and try to come out here with a win.

Are you struggling at all with the pressure of The Finals, the pressure of the fourth quarter?","No, I don't think so. I don't believe so. I know I'm not. We as a team, we played good enough to win again. Put ourself in position to win down the stretch. Everyone, guys made plays. They just made a few more than we did. That's what it came down to."

2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,You guys suffocated Derrick Rose and Jet in the fourth quarter of Game 1. Last two games Jet fourth quarter outscored you 16-2. Is he wearing you guys down? Is he just getting different looks? Why has Jet been able to explode in these last two fourth quarters?,"He made big shots. He made some great three-point shots tonight. A hand contested in his face. Some of them was open. He's just aggressive. We always said when he plays well, they're very tough to beat. That's what he's done the last two games."
2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,Erik came in here and said the thing you guys need to do the most over the next day and a half is work through the idea of closing out games. What did you learn in that stretch in March about closing out games that you can apply now?,"Well, it starts defensively. We've had a few breakdowns late in games in this series that we didn't have in the first three series. So it's something we know we can do. We just got to push through it. At this point we have no choice, honestly. We got two games left, and we worked hard all year to get home-court advantage. So we have to take advantage of it."
2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, what was the adjustment process like for you guys once Dwyane was out? Obviously coming out and starting the third quarter without him is not anything you guys are accustomed to doing.","Just try to work our same offense. I was able to get into the lane a couple of times, hit out for threes, hit out for guys that got some lay-ups, and also I was able to get to the rim a couple of times, put a little pressure on the defense. But it's nothing that you really can change. It's our habits we've been working through all season. With him being out, we just try to do the same thing as if he was in, but knowing that one of our scorers is down. But guys had to come in and try to make plays and pick up the slack while he was out."
2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, you said many times that your stats are irrelevant to you. Is that true at all with a triple-double, or does that rule still apply?","Absolutely. The only thing that applies to me is a win. A win or a loss. I could have made a couple more plays for my team. But at the end of the day, all it's about is a win or a loss. Triple-double means absolutely nothing in a loss. So we will be better in Game 6 on Sunday."
2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, in the two games you guys have won, Jason Terry didn't score a single point in the fourth quarter. In the games that they won, he scores eight or nine. Going forward, how much do you take on yourself to really shut him down in the fourth quarter?","Like I said, it's never a one-on-one matchup. I said that when he was struggling in the first couple of games, the games that we won. I said it's never a one-on-one matchup. JT is the reason why, like I said, in the top vote-getters of Sixth Man of the Year every year. He does a great job of staying active, staying in rhythm and they get him the ball in the fourth quarter. So I take pride in it. Like I said, I'm not going to always stop him or hold him under his average. I would hope so. He gets enough looks, he gets enough cracks at it, he's going to make a few in. We have to make sure we stay locked in and not allow him to get open ones like he had tonight."
2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, in the second quarter there seemed to be a concerted effort to get the ball to you in the post. They seemed to get away from that in the second half. Why did you get away from it and did you think about going down low in the stretch particularly with three minutes left when things were tight?","Honestly, we just worked our game. I was able to get the ball in the post a few times in the first half. It worked. Some of them didn't work. Second half with D-Wade being out to start the second half, I took it upon to be a little more of a ball-handler, get guys into our offense. But we just try to take what the defense gives us. We have nothing to say about our offense tonight. We shot 53% from the floor. These guys shot 57. Shot almost 70% from the three-point line. Offensively had nothing to do with why we lost this game. We just couldn't get enough stops down the stretch."
2011-06-09,45:38,17.0,0.421,10.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, at 102-100 you had the ball at the top and you took a three there. Did you think about maybe trying to drive by him, or was he giving you so much space that was the best play?","I didn't think about it. D-Wade gave it to me, I had enough room and I shot it. Shots I made before. I just didn't make it that time."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, given your performances late in games in these Finals, what's your assessment of your ability to play well under pressure?","I mean, sometimes you got it, sometimes you don't. And that was this case in this series. I was able to do things in the last two series to help us win ballgames. Wasn't able to do that in this series. Once you get to the playoffs, every game is pressure. You want to win. You have to win. And I mean, we've seen some of that in the Chicago series, we seen some of that in the Boston series. Even though we lost Game 4, we lost Game 4 in Philly, there's pressure in that series as well. So it doesn't matter which round it is. Once you get to the postseason, every possession counts."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, what in this Finals round were you personally unable to do that you wanted to do?","Live in the paint. They did a great job of every time I drove, they brought another extra defender in front of me. They did a great job defensively. Very underrated defensive team. Took me out of a lot of things that I'm capable of doing or used to doing. It took us out of a lot of things we're capable of doing, that's getting points to the paint and getting to the free-throw line. So they did a good job. Much respect to them."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"Considering all that you went through this past summer and all the effort you made to get here to specifically win a championship, what are your emotions losing The Finals now?","It hurts of course. I'm not going to hang my head low. I know how much work as a team we put into it. I know how much work individually that I've put into it, when you guys are not around. That's something people don't see. I think you can never hang your head low when you know how much work, how much dedication you put into the game of basketball when the lights are off and the cameras are not on."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, obviously you've dealt with so much criticism for the last year that wasn't at all to do with basketball. When you're getting criticized for what's happening on the court, does that bother you?","No, that doesn't bother me. I understand this is a huge stage, and you want to perform well for nobody else besides your teammates. That's ultimately what it's about for me. If I can play well for my teammates, help my teammates win basketball games, then I'm always satisfied with that. It hurts me, and I get on myself when I'm not able to play well and help my teammates win."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,Does it bother you that so many people are happy to see you fail?,"Absolutely not. Because at the end of the day, all the people that was rooting on me to fail, at the end of the day they have to wake up tomorrow and have the same life that they had before they woke up today. They have the same personal problems they had today. I'm going to continue to live the way I want to live and continue to do the things that I want to do with me and my family and be happy with that. They can get a few days or a few months or whatever the case may be on being happy about not only myself, but the Miami Heat not accomplishing their goal, but they have to get back to the real world at some point."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, with all the pressure, the criticism, the expectations, did it ever get to a point where it just weighed heavy and affected you in any way?","I don't think so. I pretty much don't listen to what everybody has to say about me or my game or what I've done with my career. I don't get involved in that. This is year after year after year for me. Me as an individual, people write or say what they want to say about me. It doesn't weigh on me at all. Like I said, the only thing that weighs on me is when I don't perform well for my teammates and the guys that I play for every day. That's the only thing that weighs on me. Because I take pride in going out there and doing the things that need to be done to help my teammates win. That's it."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,What was going through your mind entering the fourth quarter knowing you guys had that hole to get out of? What was your mentality?,"Honestly, it was about fourth-quarter defense and trying to get buckets. We got into a good groove to start the fourth. I think J.J. Barea's three at the end of the shot clock was a huge shot. Put them up seven. That was a huge shot. I think it was 81-77 at that time. He hit a shot, the three at the end of the shot clock. We played defense 23 straight -- great defense for 23 straight seconds and he hit a shot like that. So it took a little bit out of us. You don't want to dig a hole like that against anyone. Especially on your home floor going into the fourth."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, we know it's a team game and a team loss, but we know the player you are. We've seen the things you've done. We know the aspirations you have. Do you take this as a personal failing?","Any time you feel like you get to the top of the mountain and you fall off, there's definitely a personal failure. It was a failure in '07 when we lost to the Spurs when I was in Cleveland, it's a failure now for myself losing to the Mavericks. Absolutely."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, I know this may be tough to think about, but right now what do you feel like it's going to take for you to win a championship?","I can only prepare myself each year. In the summertime I'll put a lot of hard work into my individual game, try to bring my individual game to a team, and I work hard every day as an individual to go out there and perform at a high level for my teammates and for myself. I got close. Won two more games than I did in '07, and hopefully next time I get here I'll win two more games than I did in '11."
2011-06-12,40:21,21.0,0.6,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, you were a closer in the Chicago series, probably the best player in the NBA. No offense, Dwyane. Everyone is going to figure out or try to figure out what happened in these fourth quarters in terms of not closing like you did in the East Finals. What was the reason for that? And in terms of lacking your usual aggression, the way it appeared, everything okay off the court in terms of distractions or anything like that?","I've been in this league eight years. There's no distractions that can stop me from trying to chase an NBA championship. Not you guys, not anything that goes on that's not focused on my team and my teammates and what we're out there -- what we're out set to do. Like I said before, I work hard to try to put myself in position to play at a high level. When you go out on the court, does the ball always go in? Absolutely not. But the one thing I know, I never hold my head low in saying, I didn't do it the right way or I wish I would have did this. It's not about that. I put a lot of hard work into this season individually. We all did. So we have nothing to hang our heads low. Just use this as an extra motivation to help myself become a better player for next year.

We try to make it tough on him, like we do any other guard or any other player in this league  We try to make it tough for him and wear him throughout the game  But he's a great talent."
2012-05-28,43:53,32.0,0.591,13.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you've obviously played against them a lot of times  Had some success in the half court against them and some not so much  What worked for you in the half court tonight that maybe didn't work earlier in the season?","Defensively, no matter what year or group they have out there, they're great  So you try to get the ball moving from one side to another  When it comes back to you, I try to attack  I was able to attack early in the game  Also in a lot of my post‑ups I was able to get to a lot of my shots I was comfortable with making. So just always try to be on attack, no matter what point of the game it is  And I was able to get a couple to fall for me tonight."
2012-05-28,43:53,32.0,0.591,13.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you play a lot of teams where the centers don't necessarily respect your centers offensively, Ronny and Joel and they'll play off of them  KG probably does that better than anybody in the league  What do you look for from your centers in order to sort of counteract that?Â  And at the end of the game what makes you think those guys had a good game?Â  What are you looking at?","It doesn't‑‑ what our complementary guys do never show up in the boxscore, especially our centers  They go out there, they defend at a high level  They get us open offensively, setting great screens and transition and also in the half‑court set  We find them, they try to go up there and finish  Everything we get offensively from our centers is always a bonus  It puts no pressure on them offensively  We just want them to play hard, rebound and defend. We know the opposing team is going to sag off our centers, try to clog up the paint  It's been like that the last two years  But they understand their role, and that's what makes them so good."

It's a good sign  It's a good thing for us, but we understand we didn't have our best game tonight  So we will prepare and we will be better on Wednesday."

As far as after the game, it was a battle  We never felt like we won the game or lost the game until there were zeros on the clock and we looked up there and there was 115 to 111  We were able to win this game with so many ups and downs throughout the whole game  But it was exciting to be a part of it and to win."

He made some big plays for us."

And then started the overtime, I missed two free throws  Like you said, I tried to help us win  Whatever it took, whether it was offensive rebounds, trying to get a defensive stop or whatever the case may be, trying to be out there to help my teammates win  I was happy to be able to make a few plays."

They showed us something different tonight defensively, which we knew they would  We knew they would make a change  That's why this series is going to be great, because both coaches are going to make adjustments throughout the series  We get an opportunity to watch the film tomorrow, and we'll go from there."

We don't know when Chris will be back  We're not going into next game hoping that he's going to be there, or whatever the case may be  We have to prepare like he's not playing  We will prepare for Game 4 like he's not playing."

So we made a good run, but they was up too much and we got in too much in the hole."

But we're attack guys  We'll continue to attack and try to, you know, force the issue  That's what we do, and that's why we're in this position now."

2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"Following up on that point, do you feel this was your best playoff performance?","I don't know  I don't know  I haven't really‑‑ I haven't watched the film or anything like that  I just tried to make plays for our team throughout the whole game, as long as I was on the court I wanted to make plays, both offensively and defensively, to give ourselves a chance to win  I think I did that tonight."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, as much as what was at stake tonight and as much as what you guys have heard the last couple of days about you and about the team, did you come in feeling like this was a game you had to have?Â  I'm not saying you pre‑planned it.","In an environment like this you want to have a big game  I wanted to be there for my teammates, no matter what was going on throughout the course of the game  So like I said, I'm happy I was able to make some plays both offensively and defensively to help us win this game. This was a gut‑check for us  And it's good to see we were able to bounce back after that loss, after that Game 5 loss at home."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what's it feel like when you're out there dominating a game like that?Â  When was the last time you felt that way?","You just try to keep the pedal going, keep the pedal down and just continue to be aggressive  I felt like I was aggressive from the opening tip, and the guys continued to find me  I tried to keep it going. I felt like that a few times in this postseason  And it's a great feeling to be in when you feel like everything you put up is going in  But you just can't‑‑ you can never let go  You can never let it die down or anything like that  You know you have to continue to put pressure on their defense, and I was able to do that."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,Can you do this again in a Game 7?Â  And will you have to?,"I don't know  I take every game as its own  I will continue to be aggressive  I will try to continue to play at a high level like I done the whole postseason  If it results in these numbers or whatever the case may be, I'm going to go out there and play my game and play as hard as I can  I don't really care what the stats say  I won't regret Game 7  Win, lose or draw, I'm going to go in with the mindset like I've had this whole season  And we'll see what happens."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, Doc talked about how it's hard, it takes a lot out of a team when a guy hits you like that  Can you tell that you took their heart a little bit in that first and second quarter?","I wasn't paying too much attention to those guys  I was focused on what we had to do as a team, as an individual, to help us win this ballgame  I was in such a zone I really didn't‑‑ I wasn't trying to pay too close attention to their expressions or what they were going through over there  I was just doing what I had to do to help our team win this game. I have no idea."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what did you use as motivation for this game?Â  Did you think at all about the last two times you had elimination games here?","I don't know  I didn't use any motivation  I just went to my habits  I went to what I built over the course of the season, over the course of the years, and just went out and played  I wasn't going to feel sorry for myself or anything tonight  I just go out and play as hard as I can, as I said, and try to make plays for our team  And at the end of the day, whatever happens happens  I can be satisfied with that. I didn't need no extra motivation tonight  It's the postseason  I know how big these games are  Every game is big  So that's my motivation itself  But I didn't need any extra motivation in this game  I just went to my habits, what I built ever since I started playing this game."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, Coach Spoelstra talked about clearing out the noise  I'm interested how you did that  Did you turn off the TV?Â  Not listen to the radio?Â  How did you approach the last couple of days?","I don't really get too far in sports talk radio or anything like that too much  Over the postseason I've been doing a lot of reading and been watching movies and things like that  I don't really hear the outside noise of what's said about me or what's said about our team. As a team, we never get too high, we never get too low  So we kind of just try to stay focused on what's at hand  And over the course of these 48 hours we've just been worried about Game 6, how can we prepare to win Game 6  And our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and as players we tried to go out and execute that."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"Fantastic game  Listen, it's obvious you do any and everything to help your team win, but has it ever really been more apparent how central it is for you in particular to really look to shoot the ball, even if it's over two or three defenders?Â  Seriously.","For me this game is all about team  I was coached that way as a kid, and it was instilled in me ever since I picked up a basketball  As an individual you can't do it by yourself  No matter what my numbers was tonight, nowhere near we would have won this game if the other 14 guys weren't in tune and wasn't focused about us trying to win this game. So two guys come to me or three guys come to me, I'm very good at math, that means someone is open  I believe in my teammates, and they're going to knock that shot down  So that's how I play the game, and I will continue to play the game like that, because it's gotten me to this point."
2012-06-07,44:49,45.0,0.731,15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you said, I won't regret Game 7, and that's been my mindset all season  Where did that mindset spawn from?Â  I guess to not regret means you had to at one point regret.","No, it doesn't mean that  I'm basically saying this whole team is about getting back to the way I play the game of basketball  I said that to all you guys, seen the interview I did with Rachel before the season  You guys have all seen it  In a great place right now as far as the game of basketball on the court and off the court  So I'm looking forward to Game 7  See you all in Miami.

But everything we were saying going into the fourth, it's time  Let's play our fourth‑quarter defense, what we're capable of doing  I'm glad we were able to do that. DWYANE WADE:Â  Kind of the same message  We got to the huddle  It was take a deep breath  Everyone take a deep breath  Breathe  30 seconds before we start talking  And then let's focus on what we need to do  And what we needed to do, as LeBron just said, is we needed to lock down defensively  And we needed to rebound the ball and get out in transition, and not see a set defense  And we were able to do that to open the game up, get better opportunities to score and attack the rim."
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,The follow‑up:Â  LeBron did you sort of see that and adjust your game to be more aggressive in the first half because of that?,"No  I got to be in attack mode, no matter what's going on throughout the course of the game  I always know that he's going to figure it out  So it's not to say that I see what's going on with his game, so I have to be more aggressive; I have to stay aggressive  It's going to help our team a lot. I don't have to worry about him  Last series in the Indiana game where he didn't play well, I didn't even go to him or say anything to him. Â I know he's going to figure it out  It's just the player he is  For me I always have to be in attack mode and try to help our team."
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, how many times this fall when you were working with KD in Akron did you envision this moment?","I envisioned it every day we worked out  I understood what his passion was  I understood what his drive was  We pushed each other every single day  That four‑day span, we called it hell week, that we worked out in Akron  He was a little upset about the series in Dallas, where they got eliminated by Dallas, and I was as well  So we pushed each other each and every day. I envisioned us getting to this point  Like I said, I was happy for him that he's able to get to the Finals  I'm looking forward to going against him."
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,(No microphone.),It's only right  It's only right  We look forward to the challenge  It's going to be a big test for us.
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,"This is for both of you guys:Â  Did Chris tell you guys that that three‑pointer in the corner would be available?Â  Because he said he saw it in tape, whatever, especially after the last game  And what does it say about him that he's able in his third game to come back and perform like that in a Game 7?","Chris is big. DWYANE WADE:Â  Huge. LeBRON JAMES:Â  Game ball automatically goes to him  Without his production tonight, we don't win  Come off the bench, 19‑8  It's huge  It's something we haven't had  We haven't had that type of activity, that firepower off the bench since we got here  It's unique  It's very unique that CB is coming off the bench, but it may be something great for us. As far as the play, the three‑pointer in the corner, I felt like when I got the drive, that KG may sink in and try to take my drive away  So when I seen that happen, I just kicked it to him, and he just lined it up and made it  He made three of them tonight, and all of them was big. The game ball definitely goes to him  He was big time."
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,"In the last five years of playing against the Celtics, what have you learned from playing against Allen and Garnett and Pierce?","Competitors. DWYANE WADE:Â  They're great. LeBRON JAMES:Â  They're great  You can never relax  You can never relax at all on the court when you're competing against those guys  You can never feel comfortable  You always feel on edge when you go against them  This is their chemistry that they built over the years  It's like no other team that I've ever faced in the postseason  They're great  They're great. DWYANE WADE:Â  I think one thing we take away from looking at the Boston Celtics is you want to talk about someone throwing dirt on them, they get dirt thrown on them all the time, said 2‑0, they can't do it again  They've been saying that three years now  They continue to come out and prove they're going to be there  Kevin Garnett is 36 years old, you can't tell  He looked amazing  He had an amazing series  All of them guys. So we look at them as a team and say, look what they deal with, look what they go through on a yearly basis  That's something that hopefully one day we strive to be  Because that would mean we're successful and that means we're still together. They are great champions  It was tough to beat them the last two years  We thankful we were able to."
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, Doc Rivers calls you the most scrutinized athlete that he can ever think of  Do you agree with that?Â  And how do you kind of continue to overcome that the way you did the last two games as you play in your third Finals?","As far as the scrutinized, I don't get involved in that  For me as a competitor and as a player individually, I just try to do whatever it takes to help our team win  I do the things in the offseason to prepare myself to come into the season to be dominant, and I try to lead by example and lead by my voice every night we step on the floor  That's on and off the court. I can't worry about what people say about me, about my game, about who I am as a person  I can't get involved in that  People can have their own opinions, and rightfully so they can have their own opinions  For me I just go out and play at a high level, and do whatever it takes for us to win  And I can be happy with that."
2012-06-09,47:32,31.0,0.429,12.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1,"That it's even up for debate, it's interesting, right?","No, I don't think it's interesting  I don't think it's interesting at all  We've played some good ball  It doesn't matter who starts or who finishes the game  James Harden doesn't start, but he's always on the court at the end of the game  Jason Terry doesn't start, but last year in The Finals he was in the fourth quarter every game  CB didn't start tonight, but he was in the fourth quarter  It doesn't matter who starts, or finishes the game, it's who is being productive  That's what it all boils down to.

2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, you only played six guys really, a good amount of the time  You played a few more, but it was a short bench  Did that play a part in the game late in terms of getting tired?","I don't think so  You know, we know we have to have more production for sure  We're going to have to have more guys in there to give me and D Wade a rest  And Shane, Shane played a lot of minutes  But Spoel will figure that out  We'll be more conscious about it, just trying to get a minute or two here or there so we can finish strong, but I don't think it was much of a problem tonight."
2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,What was going on with you guys able to free up Shane Battier with so many open looks?,"I think offensively we just moved the ball  We moved the ball, and Shane was the recipient of those‑‑ of us moving the ball, especially in the first half  He knocked down a lot of shots, you know, and he helped us a lot to spread the floor  He's a big part of our unit, and when he knocks down shots, we're a very, very good team  He was just the recipient of us moving the ball and getting the ball from one side to another, and he was able to get some shots down."
2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"Erik said that you guys felt even to the middle of the fourth quarter you were in position to make a move, and then they just, quote, went away  What do you think happened there?","I think they made shots and we missed shots  The couple offensive rebounds they got, they didn't make many mistakes in the fourth quarter  I don't think we made many mistakes in the fourth quarter, it's just they made more plays, especially offensively  They made more shots  Russell made some big‑time shots, KD made some big‑time shots, and Nick Collison got a few offensive rebounds that allowed him to extra possessions when we did a stop  So I think that's what it's about."
2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"So how do you guys get those shots, make those shots, and be in those position yourself?","You take them with confidence, take more shots with confidence, and at the end of the day you live with it  All your shots are not going to go in, of course not, but you try to put pressure on the defense, and then when you shoot the ball, you shoot it with confidence."
2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,You guys gave up 56 points in the paint  How do you plan on stopping that next game?,Not give up 56 points in the paint  (Laughter).
2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"Talk about going forward after this loss, you've definitely got to make adjustments on defending KD and Russell  Talk about the efforts that's going to take to stop those guys  You did do a good job on Harden because he only had five points.","Well, first of all, those two guys are all stars for a reason  You can't stop them, you just try to limit them  And Russ made some big plays late, but I think we can live with him shooting 10 for 24 from the field. I think KD got a couple looks that we don't like  He had two transition threes that we gave up where he had nobody on him, and he had a couple jumpers that we didn't like, either, with nobody on him  We need to make adjustments with that  We will make adjustments  Like D Wade said, this was the feel out game  We come out with a lot of energy, try to steal Game 1, and now we get an opportunity to go to the chalkboard, go to the film and have a better game plan in Game 2 since we've already seen them to see to see what they're capable of doing."
2012-06-12,45:50,30.0,0.458,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,Kevin had the big fourth quarter  Could you sense he was being aggressive and looking for his shot more?,"He's always aggressive  Any time he's on the floor, tonight 46 minutes, he's always aggressive  It doesn't matter what court it is."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, could you just talk about, again, the start your team got off to, 18‑2, and how important that was?","It was very important  Any time you get a lead in this series, it's important, no matter if it's a double digit lead or one‑point lead, because both teams are playing great basketball  Any time you can get a quick start and get a lead, it helps."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,Can you talk about your teammate Shane Battier and the series that he's putting together?Â  He's had two great games and just talk about what Battier is doing.,"He's been a huge lift  He's been a huge lift for us  He's shooting the ball extremely well from the outside  He's making plays both offensively and defensively  We're going to need it  We're going to need it  The series is going to be so tight that we're going to need guys to step up, and Shane has been there in the first two games."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"After winning Game 2, what do you guys feel is most important going into Game 3?","We've just got to continue to do what our staples are, try to get back in transition, level them off, make them take contested shots  They're very good when you miss a shot or you turn the ball over at getting out and getting early buckets  We've got to continue to be conscious about our turnovers, and then when we miss a shot we've got to have three guys back just to try to level them off and not allow them to get those transition buckets."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, just the fact of can you address how important this game was, especially when it started slipping away, knowing you have a chance to go home 1‑1, regain home court in the moment there, how much did that mean to a potential championship run to hold on somehow?","It meant everything  We had played too well in the first 36 minutes to try to let this one slip away from us  We knew we were going to keep coming  We knew they were going to keep fighting  They've been doing it the whole postseason against all the teams they've played against, especially on their home floor  We just wanted to make one more or two more plays than they made and come out with a victory, and we was able to do that."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,What did you want to do early on inside the paint?,"For me it's all about aggression  You know, I just try to get into the paint, make things happen, create for myself, create for others and put some pressure on their defense  For me that's what my game is all built around."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"Erik said that the decision for you to guard Durant with about seven minutes left was mutual  How did that come about in the huddle, and can you go through what happened on the final play with you guarding Durant?","Well, I mean, for me, I want to guard the best and the biggest point of the game  KD is an unbelievable talent  I think we all know that, we all see that  He can make every shot on the floor  Just try to keep a body on him, take contested shots  He got away from me a couple times, got a couple threes that I am not too happy about  So I'll watch the film and try to figure that out  On the last play they were down two and I figured they were going to go to him  He got a small step on me, I just wanted to try to keep a body on him, make him take a tough shot, and he's made tough shots all year, all series, and just that one he missed it."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,You were on the other side of the two‑three‑two format last year  What do you think of the format and do you think it gives an advantage to either side?,"I mean, when you get to the championship, teams got to win on each other's floor  The two‑three‑two doesn't mean much, I guess  I don't know, you've got to‑‑ these are the two best teams  They're confident no matter what building they're in  We're happy now that it's a 1‑1 series and we're going back to Miami and will take control of the home court  It doesn't mean that the series has changed  Both teams can win on each other's floor, and both teams are confident."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,Would you have been surprised to have heard a whistle on that last play?Â  Would you have been angry?,"I mean, as a competitor, of course you would have been angry  Like I said, I just tried to keep a body on him and make him take a tough one."

2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"When so much is made of you and your team's fourth quarter meltdowns and you hit 12 of 12 free throws, including four in the fourth quarter, is that a milestone, or is that just a game in which you've got a little confidence?","I mean, I'm a confident guy  On a big stage like this in a big game like this, every point counts, every point matters  So you go to the free‑throw line, no matter how hostile the environment, and try to knock them down  You live with your routine, things you practice all year, and you live with the results  Like I said, I'm happy that I was able to go up there and make a few plays, go up there and make my free throws  We needed it  We needed every point tonight."
2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"But that's not like a larger statement about you guys in the fourth quarter, that's just one game?","That's just‑‑ we want to make enough plays to win basketball games, not to answer any questions about what people have to say about us."

2012-06-14,42:19,32.0,0.455,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1,"As you were going to the basket and being so aggressive early, are you in that mindset thinking that there's nobody on this floor that can guard me?","You know, for me I always want to be aggressive, and I don't think there was just one guy that can guard me  You know, I'm always looking at the next line of defense and seeing the rotation coming  Sometimes it doesn't work in my favor  I got into the hole one time, Ibaka got me from behind, got a block  But I don't think it's just one guy  You can't just put one guy on me and allow him to be on an island and defend me one‑on‑one  It's about being aggressive and taking what the defense gives me  When I shoot double digit free throws, that means I know personally I'm being aggressive when I'm getting to the rim  At the end of the day, it's helping our team.

2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,"How did you feel when you guys were down by 10 in the third quarter?Â  And how would you characterize the comeback?Â  Was it just kind of a grind it out, not pretty but get the job done come back?","Well, how I was feeling down 10, we weren't playing our game  They made us stagnant and they came out in the third quarter and attacked us, and we didn't attack back  We did that the last minutes of the third quarter and we was able to cut the lead, I think even taking the lead with D Wade's free throw. We didn't play good to start the third, and we can't do that  We can't do that against an explosive team like that  But it just shows our character, how we was able to come back from that and make plays and regain the lead."
2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,Was it kind of a grind‑it‑out mentality?,"Well, that's our mindset, period  That's just how we play  We always feel like we want to grind out games  No matter how well we may be shooting the ball from the outside, no matter how many lay‑ups or dunks or fast‑break points we get, we always feel it's going to be a grind‑out game especially since we're playing against a great opponent  So it was that."

In the fourth quarter we had an opportunity to extend the lead, and we turned the ball over  We turned the ball over nine times in the fourth, I believe, and that's not winning basketball. We know they're not broken  For us, we just want to improve  We want to improve each and every game, and we look forward to the challenge of Game 4."
2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Chris was in here earlier sort of talking about what you said about the series last year in Dallas, that this year you're not leaving anything on the table, you're putting it all together  At the end of the fourth quarter it was you, it was Chris, it was Dwyane getting it done  How much is there resolve now that while you have nice supporting players, we have to step up, we have to step forward, us three, we have to get it done?","Well, we've got to make big plays  You know, we understand our supporting cast is going to be there for us no matter what's going on throughout the game  But if the game gets tight, one of the three of us, or all three of us, have to make plays to bring home the win. You know, it was great to see us able to close this game out tonight  We had a comfortable lead, but they made a run  They made a quick run, cut the lead to one, and then I was able to hit Chris for a lay‑up  He got fouled, made two free throws, was able to get a stop, and that's what it's about  It's about us just trying to step up when our teammates need us the most."
2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,"You talk about wanting to attack  It just seemed around the rim tonight that you were very physical from the very beginning, taking the ball from Perkins in a couple situations, going up with put‑backs  Again, your mentality tonight played into that?","Well, we felt like they were going to come out aggressive, so I wanted to counter their aggression with aggression  Put pressure on the rim offensively or get offensive rebounds, I was able to get five offensive rebounds to give us extra possessions and get some second‑chance points  Looking at the stat sheet, we had 46 points in the paint, 11 second‑chance points  So that's good  And also we had 35 free throws  That's a really good number for us  When we're getting to the free‑throw line, even when we don't shoot the ball well, that's a plus for us  Just always trying to be in aggressive mode and do whatever it takes to help our team come out with a win."
2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Can you explain how you guys continuously overcome a size disadvantage even as your team rotation kind of seems to get smaller  And also, at this point are you just used to being a big basically for this team?","I mean, size doesn't matter  It's about just will and determination  It doesn't matter if someone is taller than you or bigger than you or weighs more than you  You just try to put yourself in a position to get rebounds or make plays to help your team  That's what it comes down to  We don't care about teams being taller than us or I guess, quote‑unquote, bigger than us  Every last one of our guys plays bigger than what their height is, bigger than what their weight is  As a team we don't feel like it's a disadvantage whoever we're going against."

2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,"For the unprofessional eyes, it seems as if you can score whenever you want, just a matter of a decision of yours  What do you think about it?","I wish it was that easy  You know, that's a great team we're going against, and defensively they have some very active players, so they kind of bring the double‑team sometimes when I'm in the post or if I'm in the perimeter they kind of put two on the ball  I just try to take what the defense gives me, try to get into the paint  If I can't do it with the ball, just try to be active on the weak side or cutting or getting offensive rebounds or getting put‑backs that way, just try to do a little bit of everything where I'm not just isolating on the post or on the elbow. You know, it's a good mixture of what I have right now, and my teammates do a good job of finding me when I don't have the ball."
2012-06-17,43:50,29.0,0.478,14.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Chris said you guys talked about the pain from last year all the time  Is that true?Â  And if so, how can you avoid it this time?","Well, it's absolutely true  We talk about it all the time  We understand that it's been a great teacher for us, just the experience  We don't take things for granted  We understand that we accept each challenge as its own, and we know Game 4 is going to be a different game  No matter what happened in Game 1, Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 is its own, and we will approach it like that  We understand that there's going to be a team that's going to come in and try to get the home‑court advantage back once again, try to win on our floor  But if we do what we need to do defensively, we make them make tough shots, we rebound, and we don't turn the ball over, we give ourselves a good chance to win Game 4  Looking forward to it.

I think they hit their first three or four shots  He was in attack mode, and you get a couple lay‑ups, his jumper started falling  He gave them an opportunity to win this game  And at the same time it just shows that we can still win those games  If someone has a spectacular game against us, we're still able to find a way to win  But he had a hell of a game  He had a big‑time game."

But I've been there before  I've had cramps before, like I said, and it's not a pleasant feeling  But I'm happy that we've got a great training staff, a great organization, and they helped me get back on my feet  I was able to walk up here and talk to you guys.

The best thing that happened to me last year was us losing The Finals, you know, and me playing the way I played, it was the best thing to ever happen to me in my career because basically I got back to the basics  It humbled me  I knew what it was going to have to take, and I was going to have to change as a basketball player, and I was going to have to change as a person to get what I wanted.

You know, I'm happy now that eight years later, nine years later since I've been drafted that I can finally say that I'm a champion, and I did it the right way  I didn't shortcut anything  You know, I put a lot of hard work and dedication in it, and hard work pays off  It's a great moment for myself."

In the summertime we worked out together  I envisioned it, but I didn't know it was going to happen, but to see a few months later that we was going to meet each other in The Finals, it was a great moment for myself and for him. But as far as your second question, I don't know  That's for you guys to write, to say if I'm the best player in the league or the No.1 player in the league  All I know is I'm a champion, and that's all that matters."
2012-06-21,44:09,26.0,0.474,11.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,1,"This question isn't intended to bait you or intended as some negative question, but what would you say to the Cleveland fans tonight that wanted to share this moment with you, wanted to win this championship with you?Â  What words would you offer them?","I mean, right here I'm sitting here as a member of the Miami Heat  The hard work and dedication that we put in these last two years to get to this point, I mean, it was unbelievable  I wanted to become a champion someday  I didn't know exactly when it would happen, but I put in a lot of hard work. For me, I'm happy  I'm very excited  I'm very happy right now to be a champion  Nobody can take that away from me."
2012-06-21,44:09,26.0,0.474,11.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,1,"Can you give us your thoughts on the Thunder  And you've been there, do you have any suggestions for KD or any of that group as to what it will take to reach that next step?","Well, first of all, I think it's a great team  Like I said before, we're the two best teams in The Finals  They create some unbelievable matchup problems with their attack, Russ and KD and James, and they have Ibaka the shotblocker, the phenomenal presence of Perkins and the list goes on  Collison is a big‑time player, as well. So they're going to be a team to be reckoned with for a lot of years because they're young, and they're going to use this experience as motivation  You know, this is not the last time we'll see the Oklahoma City  I wouldn't be surprised‑‑ this won't be the last time we see them in The Finals."
2012-06-21,44:09,26.0,0.474,11.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,1,"I wanted to ask you, your journey has taken you to very highs and very lows  What have you learned about yourself as a ballplayer and as a man through your journey to the championship?","The biggest thing I learned is that you can't control what people say about you, what people think about you  You just have to be true to yourself and true to the people that surround you and your loved ones  You know, like I said, I put a lot of hard work into this  I took one week‑‑ I took, I think, one and a half, maybe two weeks off after we lost the NBA Finals, and I just got in the gym and I got back to the basics. It just shows when you're committed and you give everything to the game, the game pays off and it gives back to you."

Love you guys. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, the final sequence, including whether the play changed after the timeout by the Pacers, if you were surprised that Hibbert wasn't in there?Â  And just your thought process on the play, please.","Well, our play didn't change at all  We went into the timeout, we had two different calls, and me and Spo looked at each other, and he asked me which one I felt comfortable doing  I had enough time where I could get to the basket and make a play. I don't know if I was surprised or not  I really wasn't worried if Hibbert was in the game at all or if he was in  I was worried about trying to get a bucket for our team."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, the decision there, once you were on the court and to basically go left, to have a step, did you ever think you may have to pull up in that situation?Â  Paul said maybe he should have played off of you a little bit, force you to shoot the jumper.","I knew I had enough time to get to the rim  Two‑plus seconds is plenty of time  I only need one dribble to get to the rim  And the set that we ran, the space that I had, you know, CB first having the first trigger, going to the rim for a lob, and Ray slipping to the corner, a thread and then I was able to be the option at that point and get to the rim."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"For LeBron, did you feel George overcommit there on the final play?Â  Or Battier hit you in stride with the pass?","Shane definitely gave me a great pass  All I had to do was just, you know‑‑ I peeked over my left shoulder  I seen Paul George was a little out of place  So I just took off  I knew I had enough time to do either‑‑ I could either get to the rim or I could get one dribble in and get up a jumper or a shot. So I seen him leaning a little bit  Just a quick second  I just took off."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, it seemed like your offense came in flurries in this game, and then you look at the final stat line and it's still 30‑10‑10  Was there anything their defense was doing that you noticed there was opportunities at certain times?Â  Or was it flow‑of‑the‑game type of situation?","Yeah, for me it's just flow of the game  I take what the defense gives me  I was able to turn the corner a few times and either get a look up at the shot or at the rim or find my bigs cutting and finishing some plays  The contribution that we got from Bird tonight was unbelievable  Without his effort we don't win this game  Just his energy and his effort once again. For me it's just the flow of the game  I don't really predetermine what I'm going to do  I just read and react  The best thing about it, the coaching staff and my teammates put me in position to be successful, and I try to take advantage of it."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"In a best‑of‑seven series with an emotional win like this, does it count a little more?","We wish we could take two wins, but we only get one  That's what it's all about  No matter if you win by one or if you win by 30 or whatever the case may be  You just want to win  We have to be better Friday if we want to win again  We'll come here to prepare tomorrow and see the ways that we can do that."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, can you talk about your nonchalant demeanor  After you hit the shot, you almost felt like I'm supposed to do that.","Well, I mean, like I said, my teammates put me in a position  Coach Spo drove a good play to put me in position to be successful  It's my job to go out there and make it happen  I mean, I made a lay‑up  It's not like I made something half‑court  I made a lay‑up  I've been doing that since I was eight years old. I understand the circumstances a little bit  It happened to have been in the Eastern Conference Finals  When you practice something over and over and over, and you just‑‑ it's just second nature to you. I also know, hey, we protect home court  This is Game 1  That's what it's about."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, on your 30‑10‑10 tonight, Spo talked about how you might need to continue at that level for you guys to win this series  Talk about it just from the emphasis of rebounding  You raised your rebounding against this team last year  How important is that?","It's very important  When we go against guys that are taller than us, a little bit bigger than us, our front court and our back court have to help out with the rebounding  I got to go out and‑‑ if I have to average ten rebounds in this series or whatever the case may be, I have to be out there for my bigs  My bigs are fighting with Hibbert and fighting with David West all game long  When some of those long rebounds come off, myself and D‑Wade and Norris have to be able to clean the glass to help our bigs out. So just trying to contribute the best way I can when I'm out on the floor."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, on the last two possessions, when you scored with lay‑ups, Hibbert was not on the floor  Vogel said when he came in, maybe next time I'll put him out there  Paul George said, I'm 100% sure that he would have been there at the rim if he was out there  How do you think it might have been different if he was out there?","I mean, I don't know  We don't‑‑ any of us know that?Â  D‑Wade was not there either, because he fouled out  I mean, you can't say what would have been different  Ten guys out on the floor, and I was able to get the lane against George Hill in the first one, and I was able to get the lane on Paul George in the second one. You know, I was on attackwhen Hibbert was in the game, I was on attack when Hibbert wasn't in the game  That's not for us to worry about."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron on the last play, if you said Chris was an option and Ray was an option, how soon after the inbounds pass did you realize they were no longer options for you?","Once I got the ball I was the only option  I was the only option at that point  Especially with only being 2‑plus seconds  As unselfish as a player I am, I cannot no way try to make a pass at that point. Like I said, I'm blessed to be in that position  My teammates put me in a great position each and every night  My coaching staff  And I just try to come through for them."
2013-05-22,46:33,30.0,0.5,10.0,10.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1,"LeBron, it was like five hours ago by now, but the play with your elbow, any problems with that?Â  And also did you get any feel for whether there's concern about Mario's status going into Friday?","I mean, after it happened, I landed on the elbow, and it would have happened when I decided not to wear my elbow sleeve  I shot the two free throws  My fingers were still tingling a little bit  But it kind of wore off. There's concern for our starting point guard  Any time one of our players go down, especially in the postseason, where every game and every possession counts and we need everyone out there, there's a little concern  But I think our training staff is amazing  Rio is a tough guy  So we'll see what happens  Hopefully he's available by Friday  He should be  We don't know  If not Norris will step up, and I know Mike Miller is looking for the opportunity to probably be back on the floor  You know, call in the righty.

2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, can you take us through obviously the final two plays, those sequences, what you saw and what happened.","First one, Ray came to set a pick‑and‑roll in the first one, and David West basically just put his hands up and he was able to get his hands on the ball  A little careless on my part obviously. And then the second go‑round, I was able to get in the lane, I spun and I seen Ray once again wide open and I was careless once again  I had the lane for Ray  I maybe should have jump‑passed it over the top  I tried to throw it through the lane, and they was able to get the hand on it again. Can't happen in that situation  Especially being down two in a big game."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"How surprising was that to you?Â  Maybe one, but not two  And what's the sort of disappointment feeling right now after two plays like that?","Very disappointing, of course, for me  That's the first thing I always look at on the stat sheet is my turnovers  I had two key ones at a big point of the game  I am very disappointed in my judgment and my plays down the stretch  But I'll make up for them."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, emotionally, how do you sort of go from what happened in Game 1 with you winning it in the final seconds, to sort of stumbling in Game 2?","I get ready for Game 3, like I did in Game 1 and Game 2  I didn't have any emotions after making the game‑winner in Game 1  We won one game and tonight we lost one  So emotionally I'm still at the same level I've been at  We had an opportunity, but they played well enough to win Game 2."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, you had what looked like a respectful exchange with Paul at the end of the third quarter  When you have a little back‑and‑forth with a guy and you're pushing a guy in a night like this, it seems to take your game to another level.","We're just two guys trying to do what it takes to help our team win  He's really good  He's going to be a great one  His maturity and his game has definitely risen in just one year because of the opportunity Frank Vogel has given him  His teammates have a lot of confidence in him, and he has confidence in himself. I love competition  I try to step up to the challenge and try to be there for my team as well."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, you've lost home court, obviously  The outside shot just isn't there from guys who have been hitting it all year  What's the level of concern right now as you head up to Indy for Game 3?","I think the outside shot isn't there for the guys who have been hitting all year for a couple of reasons; the rhythm  We have to figure out a way to get our shooters into the game more instead of trying to get them the ball and make them make a tough one late in the game for Ray or from Rio or from Shane  We have to figure out how to get them some shots early in the game, where they feel like they're part of the offense  That has to come from me, come from D‑Wade, come from CB  We're the three guys that have the ball in our hands a lot  Try to get our shooters in the game early. We know they've been there for us all year  We're going to continue to have confidence in them  We know it'll help us out a lot. I think having them a part of the flow offensively, they'll feel like they're part of the offense, they'll be there late for us."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"I know you're right in the middle of a series right now, but you've been where Paul George was in terms of becoming whatever it is you're going to be  What's the next step for a young guy with talent, with the work ethic to take that next level to be an elite player?","I mean, I know the answer to that  I'm not going to say it right now while I'm competing against the guy  He may try to use that during our match‑up right now. I know the answer to that  I'll answer it after the series."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,Your team was in a similar position last year going up there 1‑1  I know the circumstances are different; Chris is healthy right now  Can you draw anything from going up to that building with the 1‑1 situation?,"Just our experiences over the years  We've had home court and we lost a game at home  But like I said, every game, every series is different  We will figure out ways what we could have did better  Tonight we had some opportunities  We had some really, really good opportunities tonight  One that sticks out in my head a couple of plays, I think we were up four, got a stop, CB got a good look at a three  We missed it  Then Lance Stephenson I think hit a three  If CB makes that, it may be a different ballgame. Also getting another stop and Rio having a clean look from the corner. But I mean, there are experiences over the year, we just stay even keeled  We don't get too high, we don't get too low in the series  We know we're going to go into a hostile environment against a very good team, and we look forward to the challenge."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, just when we thought there was nothing new to say about the way you've been playing lately, George Hill a minute ago said, quote, ""There's only one person scarier than him and that was God.""Â  That's you  What do you think about that description?","I'm nowhere near close  I made two mistakes tonight  That hurt our team  And that hurt more than anything  Let my teammates down  They expect me to make plays down the stretch, and I had the ballwith the opportunity to make a couple of plays and I came up short  That burns. But the best thing about it is this isn't college  It's not one loss and you're done  I have another opportunity to get better in Game 3, and if I'm put in that position again, to be able to learn from it."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, because you do take such pride in not turning the ball over, and to do it twice in such a key moment, how much more does this hurt than just other kinds of physical mistakes that you could possibly have made in a game this big?","My turnovers hurt more than anything  I think the careless turnovers  My mind seen the right play in my head; two guys on the ball, Ray Allen is open  But if I could take it back, I would maybe throw the bounce pass on the first one, because David West had high hands  And on the second one I would still make the same play, but I would probably jump pass over the defense instead of going through the lane, the passing lane. When I took the spin on Paul George, I seen Ray wide open  So I tried to throw the ball through the lane, through the passing lane instead of doing the jump pass  And I would have been able to complete it. Me turning the ball over, no matter what point of the game, but especially like tonight, with us down to a one‑possession game, those hurt more than anything, more than missing a free throw, more than missing a shot, more than anything."
2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, you are focusing on the missed opportunities on offense  They also came in here and shot 50% in your building  How disappointing is that?","It is disappointing  But at the end of the day, we had a chance to win  We still had a chance to win  I thought Hibbert was big tonight  Every time we kind of made a run, he was able to make some big shots  Especially in the fourth quarter  He had his jump‑hook going, he had his rolls going. I thought George Hill was the X factor tonight  18 points, hit some big shots, some big free‑throws  Just kept them above water. We can't allow 50% on our floor  But at the end of the day, it was 40 points in the paint  It was 9‑8 second‑chance points, 8‑6 fast‑break points  We had 14 turnovers; they had 13  It was a pretty much even game  And they just made one more play, or two more plays than we made down the stretch."

2013-05-24,45:17,36.0,0.7,8.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0,"From the perspective of where Roy Hibbert was, because Chris Bosh was on the perimeter  Was he able to successfully split between the basket and Bosh so he wasn't open?","No  No  The first play, like I said, I was careless with it  I threw it back to Ray  He was open  I was still on the perimeter  Hibbert was not even around  The second play I drove and I spun away from Hibbert, and seen Ray and turned the ball over. So, no, he wasn't a distraction for me at all. THE MODERATOR:Â  Thank you, LeBron. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2013-05-26,41:13,22.0,0.471,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, could you talk about your approach in the post today  Was it something you went over with the coaching staff?Â  Erik said they wanted to get the ball deeper  Or was it something you watched film and you decided it's something you can do with Paul to give you guys an advantage?","I think it was a little bit of everything  I made a conscious effort to sit down in the post tonight, try to put pressure on the defense  Spo and the coaching staff wanted me to be down there tonight, and my teammates allowed me to do that  It was a little bit of everything."
2013-05-26,41:13,22.0,0.471,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,Can you guys explain why you think you're so good coming off losses in the playoffs over the last few years?,"We wish we can not come off losses, but it happens  It happens in the playoffs  That's what playoff basketball is all about  But we're a team who just bounces back from diversity  We love the fact that you know they took the home court away from us, and now let's see what we are made of  I think we know what we're made of as well. This is a great group of guys that always loved, I think, the pressure moments of being, I guess, 1‑1, a team taking our home court away  And we have to go on the road to win. DWYANE WADE:Â  To add to that, I also think once you come off a loss, when you win, a lot of things are massed  You don't really look at everything once you win  But once you lose, you get to break down everything  I think our attention to detail coming off a loss is a lot better  We're a mature team and once the coaches put the game plan in front of us, once they point the mistakes, et cetera in front of us, we take it for what it is, we try to correct it. I think our attention to detail is what's important in it."
2013-05-26,41:13,22.0,0.471,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, Hibbert was in here taking responsibility for not helping Paul George more when you would go into the post  What did you see in the ways that they did try to defend you?Â  And what did that open up for the rest of your offense?","Well, I mean, I seen I had a one‑on‑one match‑up  They didn't come down in the post all game, so I just tried to take advantage of it  My teammates gave me space  I just tried to sit in the post, not get the ball in the wing as much tonight  Tried to anchor myself down on the block and go to work  I was able to do that."
2013-05-26,41:13,22.0,0.471,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,"Question for both of you guys:Â  Hibbert said the game plan for them was make the big three do all the work and limit the other guys  And clearly when he said ""other guys,"" he was thinking three‑point shooters  How did Udonis become the key for you guys in this game?","He's always the key  He's the heartbeat of our team, first of all  He's the captain, one of the captains of our team  There's no one in our roster that plays that goes out there and we don't have the utmost confidence in their ability. For him to come through tonight and do what he was able to do offensively from the start, Rio stepping it up in the third, also Shane and Ray contributing, Bird giving his usual  We needed everyone's effort tonight, and it allowed us to get a big win on the road."
2013-05-26,41:13,22.0,0.471,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,"LeBron, in the second quarter, that's when you guys put the distance between yourselves and the Pacers  Talk about the keys to making that happen  And then Dwyane, talk about the ability to make that thing stand up for the rest of the second half.","Well, we have to get stops, first of all  The 34‑30 first quarter was something both teams are not accustomed to doing, being defensive‑minded teams  But we had to get stops, we had to rebound and then we had to execute  We went from a 34‑point quarter to a 36‑point quarter  It just showed the ball movement that we had. And also not turning the ball over; we had five turnovers for the whole game, and that's big time  Especially on the road  We're a team who doesn't turn the ball over a lot, but when you have under 10, you're going to give yourself an unbelievable chance to win  To have five turnovers on the road in a tough building was big‑time for our team tonight. DWYANE WADE:Â  I think that as LeBron just alluded to, what we did by not turning the ball over was we let them see our half‑court defense  That's key  They didn't get a lot of transition buckets, because we didn't turn the ball over  We was able to set our defense  When we set our defense, we're a pretty good defensive team. Also we were very efficient on the offensive end  We got the shots that we wanted, we needed  We moved the ball around  We got to a lot of post‑ups, a lot of different things  So I think even when they made their run, we continued to work the game that worked for us in the beginning  But most importantly it was all about the defensive end, not turning the ball over, so they can see all five of us on the other end of the floor."
2013-05-26,41:13,22.0,0.471,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,"The latter part of that third quarter, the Pacers, you could see the body language of the Pacers just start to fall apart  Did you guys see that and then take advantage of it?","We just wanted to keep putting the pressure on them  We scored 70 points in the first half, and we knew they were going to make a run  That's a really good team  We knew they were going to make a run  They did  They cut the lead to seven in the third  Right after that I think Rio got an and‑one to put us back up 10. We wanted to try to continue to put the pressure on them, continue to execute offensively, not turn the ball over, get stops defensively  And we could see their body language start to change a little bit  That's when we just keep going  Just keep going and not play the score, not play the lead  Just play the game  Understand every possession matters, every possession counts  At the end of the game we see what happens  We were able to continue to do that and come out with a well‑needed win."

2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"LeBron, this is the second time you foul out of a playoff game in your career  If you can explain the emotions of the moment, knowing your team has a chance to win when that happens.","You would like to be out there on the floor, especially me  Be there for my teammates especially in the closing minutes when we have a chance to win  Wasn't able to do that."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,Can you talk about your guys' execution tonight  Was it a matter of them stepping up defensively?Â  Was it a matter of not getting to what you wanted to?Â  It seemed like it wasn't as fluid as it was when you guys were playing better.,That's obvious  They did a good job of taking away our first option  Sometimes our second option  I believe though we had some really good looks and some of them just didn't go down  You give a lot of credit to their D.
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"LeBron, they were trying to give you a lot of different looks tonight  Can you just talk about the job that Lance Stephenson did and what he tried to do against you.","As a team they D'ed in on me, especially in the low post  But for me, I've seen every defense, I've seen every individual  I was able to get it going a little bit in the second half  I played mostly with foul trouble."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,It seemed like you guys answered each one of their runs every time they made one  The last three or four minutes you guys scored three points the rest of the way  What happened with the offense at that point?,"I thought we got some great looks  I thought CB had a great look by their bench, a three‑pointer  I thought D‑Wade was going to get a good look on my offensive foul  You know, you give some credit to them for sure, for holding us to only three points  But some of the shots that we had just didn't go down."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"LeBron, you guys got beat on the glass pretty good  In all 49‑30 and then beat in the paint pretty good, 50‑32, but you only lost by seven points  I know a loss is a loss, but how much confidence does that give you guys going back to Miami?","We can't afford to get beat on the glass by 20  Can't happen  It allows them to get second‑chance points  Then they shot the ball from the field 50%  As a collective group, we can't allow that. But we don't need confidence to go into any game  We're a confident bunch  We're excited to get the opportunity to go back to our home and play Game 5."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"LeBron, you competed against Stephenson a number of times  His teammates were saying he wanted and asked to guard you in this game, especially when George got in foul trouble, but even before  With a kind of impact did he have overall on the outcome of this game?","I thought, I mean, offensively he played extremely well  He attacked us  He got some offensive rebounds  He got one offensive rebound for a tip‑back  I think he played well  He played really well  But if you are sitting here and talking about an individual one‑on‑one match‑up between me and Lance Stephenson, I'm not going to harp on that."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"LeBron, how much did the foul trouble sort of keep you out of your rhythm?Â  And what did you think about the sixth foul?","I didn't believe it was an offensive foul  I was going to set a screen, and I felt like I was stationary  And D‑Wade rejected the pick‑and‑roll  Lance actually ran into me  I believe I was straight up and down on Paul George's drive, on the and‑one  Hibbert, they reversed a call with Hibbert, called a foul for me on that one  And at the end of the third they called a push‑off on David West in the end of the third. It was a couple of calls that I didn't feel like were fouls, personal fouls on me  That's how the game goes sometimes."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"As a follow‑up, even in games you guys won, Roy Hibbert was still a problem  What do you have to do to sort of compete with him a little better the rest of the series?","He's playing well  He has his jump‑hook going  I think we just got to try to clean up some of those offensive rebounds that he's getting, because he's going to make some shots in the low post  We're playing some great defense, getting them down to late seconds  One that sticks out in my mind tonight is the long heave three by Paul George that went off the backboard, and he got the offensive rebound  That was a big‑time play  I think I fouled him on that to give him a three‑point play. And then there's a couple of other ones  He's so big and being around the rim, he's able to get a lot of offensive rebounds  If we can cut that in half, it would help us out a lot."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"You get one here  Despite losing this one, do you go back home doing what you needed to do, at least get the home court then?","Yeah  We wanted to be greedy and get two  We were able to come here and regain home court  We feel good about that  It's a three‑game series with two on our home floor, if needed  We look forward to Game 5."
2013-05-28,43:19,24.0,0.444,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,0,"On a non‑basketball note, I know you had the inscription in your shoes  There's a big story in South Florida  How did you learn about this young girl?","D‑Wade told me about it today  Obviously I'm not on social media right now during the playoffs  D‑Wade came to me with the story today, and it was a no‑brainer for me  It's sad  It puts everything in perspective  At the end of the day, this game is just basketball  Two great teams, we're competing  But it's just basketball  You have a little girl or any kid that loses her life over an illness, it's very sad  It's very sad. It puts everything in perspective  I understand that this game is so magnified, and this is the talk of a lot of people throughout the day  But what happened to Bella puts everything in perspective.

2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, sort of one question in two parts:Â  Can you sort of take us through the Juwan throwing and yelling various things at halftime and what you reiterated before the third quarter?Â  Just what that third quarter felt like for you, even though you've been in that moment so many times.","Juwan's voice in our locker room on the floor is as big as anyone  As big as Spo, as big as mine, UD, D‑Wade  That's why we brought him back because he's an instrumental part of our team. He got us on at halftime, letting us know how we weren't connected as a team, we weren't playing as a team  We were wasting an opportunity. At the beginning of the third, I just tried to reiterate that in my own words, and get on the guys and just let them know we can't just win with talent  We are playing a great team  Luckily we were only down four at halftime, at the half  We had to play with a little more sense of urgency, well, a lot more sense of urgency in the second half, if we wanted to win that game."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, in the third quarter there did it reach a point where you sort of realized, for whatever reason, it wasn't going to be Dwyane's game, it wasn't going to be Chris's game, maybe instead of equal opportunity, that's just when you had to go and make it your game?","Yeah, I kind of just went back to my Cleveland days at that point and just said, hey, let's try to make more plays and be more of a scoring threat as well, and just try to figure out a way that I can‑‑ I don't know, just see if the guys would just follow me, and just lead them the best way I could. I was just in attack mode in the third quarter, look for my shot  And luckily I was able to make some."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, Dwyane Wade said after the game that you were perhaps the most vocal maybe since you've been here to rally the troops  He even punched his fists towards his hand to say how you were  Is that an accurate characterization?","Well, I mean D‑Wade is not a liar, so..  If he said it, it happened  I have a big voice in our locker room  I have a big voice on this team  I sensed what was going on with our team, you know, in the first half  And before we took the floor in the third quarter, I just gave them a little piece of my mind and a piece of my voice, and we was able to respond."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,It seemed like you had a little extra edge out there with Lance Stephenson tonight.,"Yeah  As a competitor you love challenges, and Lance is one of those guys who likes to talk some  And I'm for it, too  I really don't start it, but if it gets started, then I love to do it  It's cool. I think it's great  It shows a competitive spirit between two individuals, between two teams to go out there and just try to figure out ways to help their team win. But I'm all for it if it's there."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you and Udonis both mentioned you guys only had 40 points in the first half  What went on in the first half that you guys were so upset with and knew you needed to change?","We just had no sense of urgency  We were just waiting for the game to change instead of going to get it  Instead of going to make plays and make things happen and make changes, we were waiting for things to happen. We made a great run to actually tie it at 40‑40, but they went on on a 4‑0 run to end the half  There was a few plays in the first half that were just like, didn't make any sense to us  Didn't make any sense to me and to some of the guys, like a couple of plays we know we're capable of making that we just wasn't making  And it had nothing to do with X's and O's  It was about a sense of urgency  I think we all sensed that, we all felt that  I am glad we were able to turn it around."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"The last couple of games in particular Mario has been going to the rim pretty consistently and finding creases, getting lay‑ups and stuff like that  Have you had a conversation with him about that?Â  Or anybody?Â  It seems he has been as aggressive as we've seen him all year.","Yeah, I have  I talked to him before the game today  I talked to him after shoot‑around this morning  Letting him know where he can be aggressive, where he can make plays not only for himself but for our teammates in certain situations  Most of his possessions are coming off 1‑3 pick‑and‑roll with me and him  I just tell him just to use me  My man is sometimes kind of in between of trying to help on the point guard and not help as much off of me  So that gives Rio a lot of creases. Rio has done a great job of using me as a screen or to get in the paint, either make plays for himself or for teammates."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you said you went back to your Cleveland days  What made you think and know that that was the right move for tonight and that your team needed that from you?","I just seen how we were playing in the first half  Like I said, we were in wait mode in the first half instead of going and getting it  Just waiting for things to happen  I took it upon myself to stop waiting and just go  Just try to figure out a way to go and get it  I don't know, I just stepped outside the box a little bit and UD was amazing  I mean with his ability to shoot the ball as well and finish around the rim. As one of the leaders on the team, I just tried to do whatever it takes to try help those guys to try to follow me and lead them to the right place."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,Your flurry of jumpshots at the end of the third quarter came after Udonis's confrontation with David West  Any coincidence with that or did that stir something inside of you that was waiting to come out?,"No, I don't think so  I think UD is, like I said, he's our heartbeat  Any time there's a confrontation, if he's on the floor, he goes to protect. We're not going to let anybody talk down on our point guard  He's one of the smallest guys on our team  UD was there to protect him  I was just trying to take advantage of what I seen after that point  I don't think the confrontation had anything to do with it  I think the emotions of being in a Game 5 with the series tied 2‑2 on our home floor and being able to make plays had everything  That's where the emotion came from  I'm blessed I was able to make a few plays."
2013-05-30,44:29,30.0,0.5,8.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,"You've been here a few times, obviously, but does the realization set in yet that you're one win away from getting back to The Finals?","That's what I came here for  That's what I came here for, is to be able to compete for a championship each and every year  We are one step away from doing it once again. But it's not a promise  It's not promised at all  I made a tough decision, obviously  I think we all know the story  I'm not going to harp on that  I envisioned something that was bigger as far as a team  Sacrificed a lot for me individually, what I had going on in the summer of 2010 because I wanted to do something special with a team  And we got an opportunity as a team once again for the third year straight to make a trip to the NBA Finals  But we have to try to go out on the road in a hostile environment and take it.

It just needed one quarter  One quarter to separate the two teams  23‑21 first  17‑18 second, 23‑22 fourth  And you know, 29‑15 in that third  That was the separation."
2013-06-01,42:17,29.0,0.476,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, you're just not getting much help from Dwyane and Chris  Do you feel like you have to do it all in Game 7?","No  No  I believe in my teammates  They are struggling right now, obviously  So they got another opportunity on Monday, and I look forward to the challenge  I know they do as well."
2013-06-01,42:17,29.0,0.476,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, to piggyback on his question, Bosh and Wade were 4‑of‑19 all night  How much of that was because of the Pacers' defense or they just had a bad night?","I mean, obviously it's a little bit of both  They're two great players  When they don't shoot well or play well, it's more them  It's not taking no discredit away from Indiana's defense; they were amazing tonight  They forced us to have more turnovers than assists  And we only shot 36% from the floor. But I think Dwyane and Chris have seen every defense ever been applied to them in their ten‑year career, and they've been able to figure it out  This one just took a little longer."
2013-06-01,42:17,29.0,0.476,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, can you just take us through the play as far as the offensive foul and running down the court, the technical.","I had to run down the court to stop from being kicked out  I thought it was a pretty bad call  I don't complain about calls too much  I thought me and Hibbert met at the mountaintop  I didn't throw an elbow  Basically I went straight up  And I knew he was going to go high hands, like he had been doing  So I went to a double‑clutch to try to let him go down  Then I was able to go over the top  I don't have no idea why that was called an offensive foul. So, you know, just stopped me from being ejected  I think at that moment I just got away from the ref that called it."
2013-06-01,42:17,29.0,0.476,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,Was it your understanding the tech was for the way you ran down the court?Â  Or did you say something as you went down there?,"I said absolutely nothing  I ran down the court to get me away from the scene of the crime, I guess."
2013-06-01,42:17,29.0,0.476,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, Dwyane said after the game that he felt he just didn't have enough opportunities  What's your take on that?","I may have to look over the film  I am able to replay a lot of plays in my head  I know for him I know he missed a couple of chippies that he wished he could get back  He had a lay‑up or two lay‑ups in the third, pretty good ones, pretty good looks, some looks he hadn't had all series  He went around Hibbert I think and he missed one at the rim, it rimmed out  He had another one that rimmed out for him as well  I know he wish he could get those back  Those are rhythm plays for anyone  When you're struggling, the best thing to get is a lay‑up or a dunk  He missed a couple of them. So I can go over the film  I will watch the film tonight and I will watch it tomorrow and see ways that we can try to help him get on track  That will be great for our team."
2013-06-01,42:17,29.0,0.476,7.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"As far as Chris, we know he hurt his ankle the other night  He says it's been just not happening for him the entire series, and he's not sure why  Any thoughts on Chris?","I mean, we can state the obvious; they're both struggling  Chris is struggling with his shot, and him hurting his ankle didn't help him a lot as well  I think he will find it  He will find it  It's my job as a leader to keep him motivated, to let him know how important he is to our movement, to our chances of returning to The Finals. The best thing about this opportunity is right here we worked all season long to get home‑court advantage  If we ever had an opportunity or we put ourselves in position where we weren't taking care of business on the road, we always have one more to fall back on at home  This is the position we're in and those guys as professionals, as champions, we'll figure it out  And me as the leader, I'll have to help them figure it out."

We'd hate to be in this position, but it's an opportunity and we look forward to it on Monday, I believe."

Hey, you save it to the last game, and it allows us to advance, then I'm okay with that."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, I know you read a game, early in this game it did seem like you were kind of allowing your teammates to get into it a little bit until you started to see some openings  Go through your strategy a little bit about what you were trying to do there.","Absolutely  The first play of the game I called a play for D‑Wade  Even though he didn't shoot the ball, he got a good touch in the paint  Just to make him feel like he was a part of the offense, make him feel in a good rhythm  I called a couple of sets for him early in the game, just to get a feel for it  And it showed throughout the whole game that he was in the rhythm  He started to make lay‑ups, he started to attack, he started to make his free throws  So it was big time."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron earlier Spo said no one remembers the easy wins, the sweeps  People remember the Game 7s  What's your mindset attacking a Game 7?Â  And how important is it for big players to step up in big moments?","This is what it's all about  I dreamed about opportunities like this as a kid to have a Game 7, no matter at home or on the road  And that game allows you to advance to The Finals  I have had multiple dreams about it  To see a dream become a reality, I'm just very blessed  Our team is blessed  And we're just happy that we are able to represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals."

2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, how soon did you start thinking about the Spurs?Â  And considering that was the team you faced the first time in The Finals, how much of an incentive is it to show your growth since then?","Well, I'm not going to take this win for granted  I'm definitely going to savor this win tonight  This league is so hard to win in  It's so hard to advance, that you can't take these moments for granted. So tonight I'm definitely going to savor this for my friends and my family  And deciding what we do as a team tomorrow, I'll start to get back into the books and get back into the film on a team that's very good, very disciplined, well coached  They've got a bunch of Hall‑of‑Famers. So I look forward to the challenge, but I'm not quite there yet mentally, because I'm not going to take it for granted what we were able to accomplish tonight."

2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, it's a different team for you going back into The Finals against the Spurs  We talked a couple of days ago about what they were when you saw them the first time  It's still those same big three  How much better do you feel going back in armed with what you've got now?","First of all, I think our team is more experienced, first of all  My Cleveland team, we were very young, and we went up against a very experienced team, well‑coached team  And they took advantage of everything that we did. I think for this team, this is our third year advancing to The Finals  So we're very experienced as well  We're not young, we're not inexperienced  We understand the opportunity that we have. And I'm a much better player  I'm 20, 40, 50 times better than I was in the '07 Finals, very young, and you know  So, yeah, we're all better."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, Dwyane kind of unveiled the Euro step in the first quarter and shook Lance Stephenson  He just kept on coming  What did you see from him?Â  And the fact that you kind of took the burden with Paul George, how much do you think that meant to him?","Well, I mean, any little pressure I could take off D‑Wade I wanted to do that, especially in tonight's game  I told him we kind of talked about it this morning, about the match‑ups coming out  I told him I would take Paul George  I want to allow him to focus on his offense, not have to worry about stopping Paul George every possession and allow him to get out in transition, allow him to get out in transition, allow him to make a couple of cuts and get to the line. I think that was huge for him."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, a year ago when you beat the Celtics in the Conference Finals, you entered the Finals 0‑2, having lost two Finals  Now you enter with a championship under your belt  Does your frame of mind change compared to a year ago entering The Finals?","No  Ever since I lost The Finals to Dallas, my mind frame changed that off‑season  I just wanted to get back to playing the game that I love and have fun and play it at a high level and just‑‑ I'll take this opportunity and this unbelievable game that we have for granted. So my mindset has been the same since we lost to Dallas  I'm looking forward to it."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, what's more relieving, defeating the Pacers, a very difficult Pacers team, or reaching The Finals?",What's more relieving?
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,Yeah  What's more a relief?Â  Getting past a very difficult Indiana team or achieving the goal of getting to The Finals again?,"I mean, I don't know  As a team this is what we had as a goal, that's to get back to The Finals  But we didn't cut any corners throughout the process, throughout the whole season  This is an opportunity for us again to be able to win another championship. So I don't have a relief at all of anything right now because I have a lot of work to still do  But it's a great thing to be in this position."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you had 15 free throws, and the Pacers had 14  Was that just a product of being the veteran team in a Game 7 and wanting to establish that aggressiveness early?","Yes, we were just aggressive  We were very aggressive  I was very aggressive  That's how you control tempo  You control tempo by getting to the free‑throw line  One thing it allows us to do, it allows us to set our half‑court defense  When we get to the free‑throw line, we shot 86% from the free‑throw line  We got there 38 times. We know that we're very good in the half court  And the games that Indiana won, they put a lot of pressure on us in transition  And tonight we only gave them five points in transition  We only gave them 12 second‑chance points and only 28 points in the paint  It was a by‑product of us getting to the free‑throw line and allowing us to get our defense set."
2013-06-03,40:49,32.0,0.471,8.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,You talked about having a perspective where you remind yourself that basketball is just a game  What helped you sort of get to that thinking or made you have to take that thinking?Â  And also how has that helped you as a leader on this team?,"I think the zone and the comfort level I'm in right now happened because Dallas beat us  Dallas beat us in The Finals two years ago‑‑ or three years ago, whenever it was  I just went back to the basics  I went back home, I went back to Ohio  I worked out with my high school coach  I went back to my high school gym, and just put myself in the mindset of what made me fall in love with the game  And it's because I had a lot of fun with it. Every night I stepped on the basketball court, I wanted to have fun  I wanted to represent myself and my family and friends at the highest level. But at the end of the day, it is just a basketball game  There are so many things in life that happens that you can just put the game‑‑ you can put life in perspective  Like I said the other day with the little girl that passed away, ""live like Bella,"" that we had on our shoes  A little girl that passed away here in South Florida  Once again that just put the game of basketball, it's just a game; it put life in perspective. I'm happy I'm able to play this game at the highest level  I love to compete  I love to represent what basketball stands for  But I don't put too much added pressure on myself, because I know it's just a game.

2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,2‑3‑2 format is always tough when you lose one of those first two at home  You guys experienced that a couple of years ago  How does that change your mindset as you go forward?,"It is what it is  It's a seven‑game series  You know, we got to see ways we can get better for Game 2  We can only focus on the next game  That's what it's about."
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,What did the Spurs do to you defensively?Â  Did they try to force you to become a distributor?,"Well, yeah  They did a good job of putting two guys on the ball  When I got the ball, they kind of shrunk the floor and set a guy at the elbow and dared me to pass the ball. I know my guys will be there to knock those shots down the next game  We had some really good looks, especially in the third quarter  Rio had some very good looks  It just didn't go down. They did a good job tonight."
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, I guess along the same lines, it looked like in the fourth quarter you weren't getting a whole lot of help  Did it seem that way?",We had our chances to win  We go into the fourth quarter with a three‑point lead  So we had our chances  We had five turnovers in the fourth  We gave them some offensive rebounds in the fourth as well  And Tim Duncan had one putback; Kawhi Leonard had another one  We can't allow that.
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you guys obviously made the adjustment  You ended up on Tony Parker in the crunchtime situation  You always talk about how you guys present a pick‑your‑poison type situation to other teams  Is this a team that you guys have to look at it that way?","Yeah, against this team you can't make many mistakes  You look at statistics, you know, we put in ourselves in position to win  They shot 31%  We outrebounded them by 9  We had more assists  But we turned the ball over five times in the fourth. I was looking at the stat sheet  It says they had 21 second‑chance points  I don't really understand how is that possible with only six offensive rebounds  I'm very good at math, and the only way you can get a second‑chance point is if you get off a rebound  Am I correct?Â  Even if you hit a three, six offensive rebounds, that's still 18 points  I don't understand how that works. But we had chances  That's kind of weird  I don't understand this  Am I right or am I wrong?Â  Am I right?Â  Okay  It's crazy."
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you talked yesterday about how you have a much better team than in 2007 when you faced the Spurs  How do the Spurs compare?Â  Do they look like the same old Spurs even though their Big Three are six years older or what?","The Spurs are the Spurs  They're going to put you in positions where you feel uncomfortable offensively and defensively  And every time you make a mistake, they're going to capitalize on it."
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, I asked Erik about you and Dwyane sitting to start the fourth  He said both of you needed a minute  Do you go to him or did he go to you?","I told him I needed one  At that point I had played the whole third  I had been accustomed to being able to start the fourth  But the third quarter was so‑‑ I was in the paint, defensive rebounding, I was closing out Kawhi Leonard on shooters  It took all in the tank from me in the third quarter  So I needed a little breather."
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, when Dwyane came in, he said that the Heat looked a little bit like a fatigued team that had played a seven‑game series in the fourth quarter  Was that in part the difference in this game tonight?","The fourth quarter was the difference  I can see it on a few of our guys' faces  Felt a little fatigued, still a little banged up from that seven‑game series  They looked like they were rested in the fourth quarter  They took advantage of that  We had some mental mistakes, and we played some really good basketball  But in the closing quarter we had some mental mistakes  And it's only a couple of teams you can't have mistakes against, especially in the fourth  And San Antonio is definitely the number one team."
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you guys often talk about how in these three years together you have seen and experienced absolutely everything at this point  Do you rely on that right now to get through the next couple of days and not let this one loss overshadow what could be coming up?",It's the first team to four  They came in and beat us on our own floor in Game 1  I know they're going to be hungry to try to get two  So we have to be able to combat that and come back with a Game 2 plan that's better than Game 1 and even the series.
2013-06-06,41:35,18.0,0.438,18.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you had 18 points on 16 field‑goal attempts  How do you get that offensive efficiency up?","I mean, I missed some shots  I missed some really good looks  As far as being efficient, I'm not worried about that  I also had 18 rebounds and 10 assists as well  So you know, I'm not too much worried about what I do as far as scoring."

2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you had that great block on Tiago Splitter  Can you talk about the play and how you think it affected the game.","Just wanted to, I guess, make an impact some way  Offensively it was a struggle for me; couldn't make a shot, missed lay‑ups  Some things I'm accustomed to making  So I just wanted to make some plays and try to help our team  And I was able to protect the rim on that one. Basically I told myself, you'll end up on Sports Center where you're going to get dunked on or you're going to get a block  Luckily I was on the good side of the Top Ten and the Not So Top Ten."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you spoke after Game 1 about distributing confidence to your teammates, the balance  You have a game today where you got five guys in double figures  A couple of guys with nine points  Does this maybe show a little bit more of why when people say, why weren't you more assertive, and you said, ""because of what we have""?Â  And how comforting was it, while you were struggling to a degree, to have that kind of support system?","I already know what we have here  Like I said, I don't really read into it of what people want more of me or whatever the case may be  I will continue to find my shooters, if they're open  And I will continue to try to put pressure on the defense  If I draw two, I'll find my shooters  I have confidence they're going to knock them down  They did that tonight  Ray, Mike Miller, Rio made big plays after big plays for us."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"You talked about how in that moment you were thinking about, it's going to be a Top Ten play either way  Is the game really that slow for you where in the time Tony makes a pocket pass and Tiago takes one dribble, you can slow the game down that much where you know that one way or another something really good or really bad is going to happen?","Yeah  Absolutely  I was, I guess, the last line of defense  I just pride myself on that side of the floor, honestly  It didn't matter to me  I was going to try to protect the rim the best way I could. Like I said, I was fortunate enough that I was able to make a big play for us  We were able to go down the other end and I think Ray hit a three after that, I believe. Just being on both sides of the floor, being able to make an impact is what it's all about."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you've talked about how Mario has been aggressive on the pick‑and‑rolls especially and gone to the basket in a couple of instances today, ending up with and‑one situations  And then he said he had a conversation with you where he said basically let's go for the kill here  Can you recount that conversation?","Rio, he has to play big for us in multiple facets  I think that especially defensively he's guarding arguably the best point guard in the league  But I think he also has to make Tony work on the defensive end  He can't be passive  He has to attack the paint  He has to shoot his shots when he has them. We started to get a little flow, and I started to see him start to play really well, especially coming off pick‑and‑rolls  We ran a lot of pick‑and‑rolls between the two of us, and I told him to keep attacking and let's try to push this lead up and go for the kill  And we were able to do that."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, after all the focus on your Game 1, what you did do or didn't do, what your boxscore looked like, your numbers aren't that radically different from Game 1  You lose Game 1 by four and win this by 19  What conclusion should we draw out of that?",I don't know  Whatever conclusion you want  It's a 1‑1 series  That's the only conclusion I know  We look forward to Game 3.
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Do you come in knowing that if you play the same style of game, guys are making shots and the ball is getting distributed, that it's going to go your way more often than not?","What I do know is sharing the ball is contagious, and it allows everyone to feel involved in the offense  For me personally, I know I attract a lot of attention  This team has been set up the right way where when I do attract attention, we have guys that can make plays. Tonight was another case of that  They packed the paint on me  I seen two bodies, unless I was in transition when I missed a couple of bunnies  But when I felt like‑‑ my shooters just need a little bit of room  Mike showed that, Ray showed that and Rio showed that tonight."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"On a night like this when you're not as efficient as you normally are and you're not as in rhythm and not even getting to the free‑throw line, take us into your mindset as you try to kind of figure out the game and get your own game going, how you did that.","Now offensively if I'm not in the rhythm, you need to make a couple of plays to make an impact  That's what you're on the floor for  You need to do it on both sides of the floor, however you can do it  I think what helped me was the late third quarter pocket pass from Rio, I was able to get a lay‑up  Then I came out in the fourth, I was able to make an elbow jumper  And then I made some plays defensively to try to help  I made some defensive rebounds  I was able to get the block on Tiago, and then my shooters finished some shots I was able to get them in transition. You know, that's just part of my game  When I'm not scoring or I'm not as efficient offensively where I feel like I'm missing some shots, I just figure out ways that I can still help the team, even if it's not scoring as much."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,Did you feel you were controlling the game even at that point before you kind of got a little rhythm?,"Well, honestly for me, when I was struggling offensively, my teammates continue to keep it in range  And we even had a lead at one point  Especially late in the second quarter when we made that run and I was struggling a little bit. So I think Rio more than anybody kept us aggressive, him getting into the paint, him getting those and‑ones and making a couple of threes  It allowed me to sit back and wait for my time."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, one of your shooters, Mike Miller, seemed to be kind of everywhere defensively, had that little flip pass also over to you  How much sort of a refreshing boost has he been?Â  Because he seems to have a whole lot of energy.","We want him on the floor  As teammates, we want him on the floor  We know what he brings  He's a 6'7"", 6'8"" two guard/small forward that can shoot the ball from anywhere and can rebound at a high clip  With the lineup we had in the late third to the fourth, me, Rio, Ray, Bird and Mike it spreads the floor  It spreads the floor for our attackers. When Mike gets the ball‑‑ our shooters got the fluorescent light on our team  They're not even allowed to pass  When Ray and Mike get the ball, they have to shoot it  No matter how close the defenders are, they have to shoot it  When you have that leeway and that confidence, you just have to let it go."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,You talked about the rosters of both teams and how they're built to complement the Big Threes  How much is that supporting cast for both sides going to impact this series moving forward?,"I mean, it's key  The Big Three I guess on both sides  You know, you can kind of rely on them at all times  But I think the supporting cast is really why both teams are here  They've been making an impact all year long, and they feel like their supporting cast is better  We feel like our supporting cast is better  It's who goes out and do it each and every night to help seal wins."
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, what is your take on the 2‑3‑2 format?Â  And do you look at it as no big deal now playing three straight in San Antonio?Â  Because you guys historically have been so good on the road.",I really don't‑‑ it doesn't matter  Two best teams in the NBA at this point  Both teams have won and can win on each other's floor  So it's not a biggie.
2013-06-09,40:33,17.0,0.412,8.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,"I know how much you love discussing injuries, but you had a wrap on your knee tonight that was noticeable  Is that a new thing?","No  I got a floor burn in Game 1  Instead of the band‑aid, I wrapped it so the band‑aid won't fall off."

2013-06-13,41:23,33.0,0.6,11.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you never get the feel of what Dwyane Wade is going to do some nights, it feels like from outside perspective  Do you know something about him?Â  And how he could show up on a night like this, when other nights he just looks like a woozy fighter walking down the court.","Well, he's a competitor, and every time he's down, he responds  For him to go out there and play the way he played tonight, it was amazing  32, 6 boards, 4 assists, 6 steals  The 6 steals let me know he's very active both offensively and defensively. He went back in his bag today  He was Flash tonight  We needed every bit of it."
2013-06-13,41:23,33.0,0.6,11.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,"Is he hurting, do you think, physically?","Yeah, he's hurting  Of course he's hurting  He's been playing with a bum knee all year  He's hurting, but he's not making no excuses about it  A performance like tonight will make you feel better."
2013-06-13,41:23,33.0,0.6,11.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you talked about how you wanted to get out and run, get rebounds, get out in the open floor  You were able to do that pretty much from the beginning  Did you execute your game plan tonight the way that you wanted to?","We had a game plan, and we played well  We played well offensively and defensively, and we needed it  We needed everybody, contributions tonight from the starters to the bench  We stuck with the game plan, even as they were making their run in the second quarter and some of the runs they made in the third."
2013-06-13,41:23,33.0,0.6,11.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, when Spo had to pull you out so you could catch your breath, you looked like you were extremely gassed  How big of a break did you need right there?","Well, I needed a break a few minutes, for sure  I gave it everything I had  I was just playing as hard as I could until the tank was empty  And that's how it's going to have to be for the rest of this series  I was just trying to keep my foot on the gas, me personally, and just play till, like I said, until the tank was empty  That's why we have guys that can come in, when guys get tired, just keep the momentum going."
2013-06-13,41:23,33.0,0.6,11.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you've talked a few times this series about shooters need to see the ball go through the basket  You saw it go through the basket the first time midway through the first quarter and then kind of took off  How big was that when Norris Cole hit you with that pass and the bucket and you took off?",I just came into the game confident  Before I even made a shot I came into the game confident  I knew what my mindset was going to be  I didn't worry about last game  Last game was history  And I just worried in the present  I'm blessed and happy I was able to make a contribution to our win tonight.
2013-06-13,41:23,33.0,0.6,11.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you guys talk a lot about must‑wins and coming back when your back is against the wall  Is the next challenge now to try to handle prosperity and put two of these wins together?Â  You guys haven't had two consecutive playoff wins in about three weeks.","That's exactly right  You said it perfectly  We can't wait until our back is against the wall every time to respond  We have to build some momentum  And we can use tonight as momentum, but we still have work to do. We still got to get better  There was some stretches tonight where we didn't play well  And if we understand and if we own it, we come in with a mindset on Sunday that we are desperate once again, and our back is against the wall. So it's going to be a challenge for us, and we have to be ready for that."

As bad as I played in Game 3, I put all the pressure on me to say I can't afford to play like that and hope for us to win  Not at this level  So I was able to forget about it  It hurt  I watched the film  It hurt watching it  I didn't like the way I was playing  But I just came in with a whole new clean slate tonight, and like I said, I was blessed to be able to make a few plays to help us win."

Sometimes you're lucky, and sometimes you're in the right position  So it's been a little bit of both."

That dude was amazing  Like I said, he was '06 Flash tonight  And we needed every bit of him  Thanks, guys. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

So it is what it is  We have a Game 6 on our home floor."

2013-06-16,43:41,25.0,0.364,6.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0,How do you keep your focus small and not on the legacy of the implications of all of this?,"I always kind of focus on the present  And for us the next challenge is Tuesday night  We will get better tomorrow  We're going to watch film, see ways we can clean up our starts, especially our first quarter  We're not playing well in the first quarter  We have to figure that out. But our next challenge, biggest challenge will be Tuesday night  We have an opportunity on our home floor with our home fans to keep the series going, and we look forward to it."

2013-06-16,43:41,25.0,0.364,6.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, you had been asked about why this team has been unable to win two games in a row, and you said, ""Now is the time  Now is the time.""Â  Why have the Heat been unable to win two games in a row?",If I knew the answer we would have won two games in a row  I don't know  Just haven't been able to do it.
2013-06-16,43:41,25.0,0.364,6.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0,"LeBron and Dwyane, talk about how important it is for both of you guys to reestablish your individual offense inside the paint in Game 6.","I think that's where it starts for us, honestly  Getting into the paint  I think between the two of us, we probably missed 12 lay‑ups tonight  Transition lay‑ups that we usually convert  I missed a lob  I missed two lay‑ups  Transition on the same possession  I know D‑Wade had a few lay‑ups that we're accustomed to making  Those are points in the paint that we weren't able to convert which we are not worried about  Those are shots we make  And maybe it would be a different turnout at that point."

2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what do you remember about that play?Â  And I know it's not a big deal, it's your headband  What do you remember about that play and your decision to not go with it from then on?","I don't even remember the play much  I was just focused on the job, the task at hand, and just trying to be aggressive, just trying to figure out ways I could help the team get back into the game  And you know, I guess the headband was the least of my worries at that point."
2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, Chris Bosh said after the game this was maybe the best Finals game he's ever seen in person or on TV, whatever  Put it in perspective how exciting this game was, and how dramatic was it among games you've played in and all that.","It was by far the best game I've ever been a part of  The ups and downs, the roller coaster, the emotions, good and bad throughout the whole game  To be a part of something like this is something you would never be able to recreate once you're done playing the game  And I'm blessed to be a part of something like this  And I'm happy about the way we dug down and was able to get a win  It didn't look like we could muster up at some point in the game."

2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you made the three that got it within two and then on the possession Ray‑‑ you missed the first three  When Chris got the rebound, you were screaming for the ball  You were jumping  Your arms were up in the air  Did you think Ray was going to take the shot or did you want to take that shot?","If it's not me taking the shot, I have no problem with Ray take that shot, man  He's got ice water in his veins  Ray can‑‑ like I said, Ray can be 0‑for‑99 in a game and if he get an open look late in the game, it's going down  That's just the confidence he have in himself  It's the preparation that he prepares for every game  It's the confidence that we have in him  We seen it before  We seen it before. We're happy to have him on our side  And this is the reason why we wanted him in games like this."

But I don't think fatigue played a part in the game  I think both teams had a will to win  We just made one more play at the end of the day."
2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you had been on the other end of a lot of Ray's threes in the past  Talk about what you remember when you guys acquired him  And also how much recruiting did you do to try to get him here?","I did a lot  I called him, texted him  I just knew what he could bring to our team  Just like you said, I've been on the other end of seeing him get them feet down, putting them stupid two fingers after he make the shot  Not so stupid anymore now that he's my teammate; I love it. He's big‑time  He's big‑time  We love‑‑ we're so happy to have him, man  He creates so much for our team  And to have someone as dangerous as that on our roster, man, it means so much."

Â CB made some unbelievable plays tonight  He got the offensive rebound  Hit Ray, and once Ray got them feet down, I seen it in the air and I was like ""It's going in  It got a chance  It's going in.""Â  And he drained it. Just gave us another life."
2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, I don't think maybe even you would admit we have not seen that great team we saw in the regular season yet, but I know you have a great opponent here  Do you feel like you are at all lucky or fortunate that you've made it this far to a Game 7 with a chance to win on your home court with the way that you've played?","I think luck plays a part, of course  But at the end of the day, we're out there busting our tails to make‑‑ to put ourself in a position to have a little luck  But at the end of the day we have a Game 7 on our floor to win the NBA championship. So I really don't care how the hell we done played so far  (Laughing)  We could have played the worst six games of our lives, but we got a Game 7 on our floor  So Thursday is for all the marbles."
2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, in the third quarter I think you were 3‑for‑11  The team was down by 13 points  You're playing a team with a championship pedigree  Talk about what happened just inside of you and the will that you drew upon to turn that thing around  Take us inside what's that's like.","I was struggling shooting the ball  We were struggling  And they took a commanding 12‑point lead to start the fourth  After we came out before we entered the ball, I basically just told myself, give it all I got  If we go down losing, I'm going to go down with no bullets  I'm going all out  I can be satisfied with the results. That's exactly what I did  I just tried to play both sides of the floor on a high‑intense level until I had no more left in the tank  Looked at Spo a few times  Told him I need a timeout, so I can get a rest  And just go back on the floor and try to make plays happen  Just try to do whatever it takes for our team to win, man  And that's what it's about."
2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,What made it the greatest game that you've ever been a part of?,"I just think the emotions  The emotions, the ups and downs, us being up, us being down  I think more than anything just our mental toughness  Our mental toughness to make it almost look like the game was out of our hands, and to come through victorious  And to be a part of something like this, like I said, once you're done playing this game, you would never be able to recreate a feeling like I had, we had, the fans had, you guys had, people at home  Never be able to recreate that  I'm just blessed I could be a part of such an unbelievable moment."
2013-06-18,49:46,32.0,0.423,10.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you just said that fourth quarter you got into this kind of desperation mode  What do you guys need to do to start the same thing quarter No. 1 for Game 7, the same intensity?","I thought we did a better job in quarter one today of coming out with a sense of urgency  I think Tim Duncan, he was amazing in the first quarter  They made some tough shots  But we still had a two‑point lead. It was the second quarter that really killed us  We got outscored by eight in that quarter  And in the third quarter we got outscored by four. If we come out ‑‑ at the end of the day, it's the last game of the season  It's the last game of the season  You have to muster up all the energy that you might have  It's not about X's and O's at this point  They know what we're running  We know what they're running  We know their personnel  They know our personnel  It's about getting stops defensively, staying in it mentally, not turning the ball over, and making a few shots. The best team will be crowned Thursday night  Thank you. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Can you talk about stepping outside, hitting the five threes  What did you see that led you to do that?Â  When you're making shots like that, you're totally unstoppable  I'm sure you would agree.","Yeah, I am  (Laughter)  You said it  I mean, two‑and‑a‑half games I watched film, and my mind started to work and I said, okay, this is how they're going to play me for the whole series  I looked at all my regular‑season stats, all my playoff stats, and I was one of the best mid‑range shooters in the game  I shot a career high from the three‑point line. I just told myself why ‑‑ don't abandon what you've done all year  Don't abandon now because they're going under  Don't force the paint  If it's there, take it  If not, take the jumper  And I think the last‑‑ I did a good job in Game 4  Didn't make as many shots I would like to from the outside in Game 5, but I kept on getting into the rhythm of it. Just saying everything you've worked on, the repetition, the practices, the off‑season training, no matter how big the stakes are, no matter what's on the line, just go with it  And I was able to do that."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, three straight Finals trips  Two straight championships  Do you guys feel like you're just starting to scratch the surface of the potential of this thing?","I hope so  I hope so  I mean, this is what it's all about  I came here to win championships and to be able to go back to back  Two championships in three years so far  It's the ultimate  I don't want to think about next year right now, what our possibilities are next year  Got to take full advantage of this one  It's an unbelievable moment for our team."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you were drafted ten years ago this week  Can you put in perspective the improvement you've made as a player  And was that on display tonight?","I mean, I said before the series that I was a better player than I was last time I faced the Spurs  Didn't look that way the first couple of games  But I stuck with it  Through all that adversity and throughout, I guess, the rhythm that I was in at that point, I just kept going  Just trusted all the work that I put into my game  And to be able to come through for your teammates, for me, I think‑‑ you know more than anybody how much I care about my teammates and hate letting my teammates down  To be able to come through for my teammates in the biggest moment on the biggest stage makes me more satisfied than anything in the world."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you have probably taken two, maybe three weeks off since you came out of the cave after the 2011 Finals  How is it possible that‑‑ you haven't really complained about it either, with the whole thing on your shoulders you come up with 37 tonight  How is that possible even for you?","The saying ""hard work pays off"" is a true testament of what happened tonight  I know I'm not the only one that works hard  Give a lot of credit, first of all‑‑ I forgot to state that at the beginning‑‑ to the San Antonio Spurs  First‑class organization  First‑class players  But to be able to put in the work that I've put in since I got out of the cave, like you said, after that Dallas series and for it to pay off like this, it's the ultimate  It makes you want to work even harder. I guarantee myself I'll take more than two‑and‑a‑half weeks off this offseason  I need it."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,Do you know when the next time you're going to touch a ball will be?Â  Have you thought about some of the other stuff you have going on this summer?,"I have a basketball camp in Las Vegas  The top 100 high‑school kids from July 5th to the 9th  Hopefully I don't see many of you guys  I don't mind seeing you guys, by the way  I probably will touch a basketball to mess around a little bit  But I don't know, I haven't set my goals yet for my offseason training  I will, but not right now  Please don't ask me about my offseason training right now."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, with regard to the last two games, defensively, Tony Parker had gotten away from you guys  What did you do in the last two games as a team‑‑ because you ended up on him a lot‑‑ to shut him down and corral him?","Just pressure  Trying to keep a body on him at all times  I think more than anything, having guys back in transition  I think we all know, if you watch the NBA over the last ten years, Tony Parker is always in the top‑‑ I don't know‑‑ five, ten at points in the paint  It comes from early transition buckets and also comes from halfcourt sets when guys are just not alert. So our number one key with Tony Parker was when the ball went up, made or misses, we had to get three guys back  The guy that was guarding him, the big and another guy to see bodies, because if it's one‑on‑one with Tony Parker, he's going to make you pay  He's going to make you pay  And the simple fact that we just keyed in on our details defensively, it helped us out a lot."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, so many people are saying this was tougher, but everybody always says the first one is the toughest  Was this tougher for you?Â  And what made it‑‑","Last year when I was sitting up here, with my first championship, I said it was the toughest thing I had ever done  This year I'll tell last year he's absolutely wrong  This was the toughest championship right here, between the two  I mean, everything that we've been throughout this postseason, especially in these Finals, to be down‑‑ we were down every odd game  We were down 1‑0  We tied it  We were able to take a lead, but then we were down  We were down‑‑ we were scratching for our lives in Game 6 down five with 28 seconds to go. To be able to win that game and force a Game 7 is a true testament of our, I guess, perseverance  And us being able to handle adversity throughout everything  It meant a lot for us to be able to do that and force a Game 7 and being able to close out at home."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"What did it mean to see Dwyane come out, do what he did early, aggressive, even waving you off at the half to make that last shot.","Right  He was big‑time tonight  He didn't wait  He had I think five or six one‑on‑one iso situations, jumpers  He was in attack mode all night  He had 10 rebounds  He had 23 points  He had two blocked shots. I think one of the most important plays of the game, that he didn't even make, was his attack at the rim when he tried to dunk on Tim Duncan, and Tim Duncan got a piece of it  It just showed at that point you knew that this was the D‑Wade that we've all wanted to see. What can you say?Â  He's a three‑time champion, gold medalist, Finals MVP  He's one of the greatest two‑guards, one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen  He continues to add to his rÃ©sumÃ©."
2013-06-20,45:00,37.0,0.522,12.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you've won it all now for two years in a row  What's the goal now for your career going forward?Â  Where do you want to go from here?","I mean, I have a few goals  My goal, one of my first goals is to continue to inspire the youth to want to play this game of basketball or to be better at whatever they do  I mean, I love kids  Hopefully tonight I was able to inspire a lot  Inspire millions to‑‑ no matter what they've gone through in their lives at that point in time, they can always overcome it  That's the first thing. Second thing for me is to continue to lead my teammates  Every single day in practice, every single day in film sessions, I know the grass isn't always green and there's going to be trials and tribulations  But hopefully I can continue to be the leader for my teammates. And then lastly, I want to be, if not the greatest, one of the greatest to ever play this game  And I will continue to work for that, and continue to put on this uniform and be the best I can be every night."

So now it's going to be one of the best weddings ever  I'm going to sign off with that  And I will see you guys when I see you guys  And please continue to motivate me  I need you guys  Thank you.

Obviously, a three‑point shot is a big thing for our team, and tonight they weren't there  No one had it going  We had some really good looks  They didn't fall, and we just got to do a better job executing in the next game."
2014-05-18,40:50,25.0,0.611,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, what was the breakdown defensively?","A little bit of everywhere  I mean, they got some threes early on  Our pick‑and‑roll coverage had a lot of breakdowns, including myself; I broke down a few times defensively, and we allowed them to get into the paint  I mean, they shot 37 free throws to our 15, which is definitely something that we can't duplicate going into Game 2. But we had some breakdowns throughout the game, and that's what resulted in us losing this game  As a veteran ball club, we will watch the film and break it down and be better prepared in Game 2."
2014-05-18,40:50,25.0,0.611,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, normally your team in the playoffs especially is really good at pick‑and‑roll defense  You kind of touched on it  Is that something that you all have to go back and watch film and try to figure it out, or is it just instinct?","It will be a little bit of both  Just because you watch it on film doesn't mean it's going to be exactly how you want to play in it  You've got to be able to read and adjust on the fly. But I think going into Game 2 we'll be more mentally prepared for their actions and have a game plan of how we're going to cover their pick‑and‑rolls  They did a great job with their pick‑and‑rolls, with Roy setting it or David setting it and exploited us."
2014-05-18,40:50,25.0,0.611,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0,"Besides cleaning up the pick‑and‑roll defense, what are some of the things you guys feel like you need to do in Game 2 to even this thing up?","The game's still so fresh  It's too hard just to say, well, we need to do this better in Game 2  We need to evaluate our mistakes and things we did well in Game 1 first before I can say what we need to bring to Game 2. Tomorrow will be a game‑‑ I mean, will be a day when we watch film and start to prepare for Tuesday."
2014-05-18,40:50,25.0,0.611,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, going with Shane instead of Udonis, which I think you guys had spoken about was possibly more likely, put you at the four a little bit more  Against this type of physical team, considering the success you had with U.D. in last two games against them, one, were you surprised by the lineup?Â  And how does this change the dynamic with you having to go in the four and play smaller against us?","We wasn't surprised because Spo told us what the lineup was going to be  So we weren't surprised  It's got to be a collective group, not just one guys or two guys. We all have to get down there and help everybody out  They outrebounded us by nine  So we've got to do a better job of that. We will see  We'll make adjustments, and we'll be a better team in Game 2."
2014-05-18,40:50,25.0,0.611,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, following up on that, how did you think that the small lineup at the start affected the team?","We just gave them too many points in the first quarter  We let George Hill get into a real good groove to start the game  And from that point on, I mean, they hit 30 on us, and we just broke down defensively, had a couple of breakdowns, couple of miscommunication errors  Like I said, which we will clean up. They took care of business Game 1, and we'll figure it out going into Game 2."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you had a pretty quiet night for three quarters, then the fourth quarter you exploded for 12  Do you already have the mindset that you can get buckets whenever you want?","I mean, I just play the game  However the game presents itself, I just try to take advantage of it. I needed to do something in the fourth  I did a great job in the third quarter of attacking and getting my guys some open looks  I hit Cole for two threes, hit C.B. for a three, but I needed to make a few buckets as well to help us in the fourth quarter, and I was able to come through for us."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, were you happy with the way you all banged with David West tonight?Â  He went 5 of 16 from the field  Can you talk about what you did defensively on him this time.","Just tried to keep a body on him  Very good player  Our bigs took a challenge on him all night  Just try to run him off the shot  When he drove, just tried to keep a chest in front of him  Made him take contested shots over the top  Offensively, we just tried to attack him as well  Put him in some pick‑and‑rolls. He got a couple of early quick fouls  So that maybe got him out of rhythm, too  But our bigs did a great job on him."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"For both of you guys, what was the biggest difference defensively between Game 1 and Game 2?","We got back to play Miami Heat basketball  We flew around, covered for one another. Â Even when we made mistakes, we still covered for one another. We allowed them in Game 1 to dictate what our defense did, and that's not us  They had us on our heels the whole game, and that's not how we play basketball  Every time we lose, we always‑‑ that's the first thing that we can see. Defensively today, we came out with an aggressive mindset  Even if we made mistakes, guys had to cover for one another, and I think we did that for 48 minutes."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, Norris said in the locker room that you actually were the one that kind of tabbed him and said, ""Why don't you pick up Stephenson?""Â  Is that right?Â  And he said you continued to do it as the game went on.","Yeah, absolutely  Norris is‑‑ I mean, he's all about defense  He's all about team. Â Whatever it takes to win. I believe that he'll be a good matchup on Stephenson, even though Stephenson is a bigger guy  He's going to get some shots over him  He's going to make some plays, but I think Norris can lock in on him  And it allowed D‑Wade to shift to Paul George and allowed me to shift to George Hill. So that versatility that we have on our wings at that point, it helps a lot  But for me as a leader, I just try to give confidence to guys, and I was confident enough for Norris to take on that challenge  Lance had it going, and at the same time, Norris got it going on the other end offensively too, making two threes in a clutch situation."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, how does going back to Miami with a split 1‑1 affect the way you work through these next three days in between games 2 and 3?","I think the three days are going to allow us to prepare for Game 3  Even though we won, we're going to break down the film as if we lost and see ways we can get better even with some of the mistakes that we made. I think the best thing about tonight, even though we made mistakes, we were flying around, and we were playing the type of basketball that we wanted to play  When we do that, we give ourself a great chance to win, and we can live with the results. So with these three days, we're not comfortable, and we're not satisfied at all  We came here  We got Game 2, but Game 3 is a new game, and we're going to start preparing for that tomorrow and get ready for it on Saturday."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"For both you guys, at the end of the game you guys at one point scored 20 consecutive points, and a lot of it was playing off each other  Can you talk about the kind of mental telepathy that you guys kind of have in that situation where you both read and react to each other?","We have no idea we're doing that until we hear it after the game, which is our plan  We believe it doesn't matter whoever has the ball in each other's hand, we're going to make the right play not only for ourselves but for our team. Tonight was one of those nights once again, where we were making plays, finding guys, and finding each other, finding a good rhythm with the ball in our hands. We don't know we're doing those things, but we just try to make plays and do whatever it takes to help our team win."
2014-05-20,42:21,22.0,0.5,7.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you talk about covering for each other  You had a play where you blocked the ball and went for the layup and missed and Dwyane followed it up and put it in  How important is that play in keeping the run going?Â  Dwyane, if you could explain what you saw in that play.","It was a huge momentum play  We did a great job on that possession  Hibbert got the ball, and our big did a great job of pressuring him, and he took a couple dribbles and then stopped, and everybody just locked in on their individual man. D‑Wade kept the Paul from Paul George getting it  Norris kept it from Lance  C.B. kept it from David West, and I was trying to do the same thing to George Hill  When George Hill got the ball, I just tried to lock in on him  I was able to get a steal. Usually, D‑Wade don't even chase me down  He knows if it's a one‑on‑one matchup with me, most of the time I'm going to score  I was glad that he did  I missed the layup, and he was able to tip‑dunk it  Huge momentum play in the fourth quarter when we needed it the most. DWYANE WADE:Â  Yeah, like he said, 99.9 percent of the time, when he's one‑on‑one with someone, we take our chances  Just at that moment, I actually noticed he didn't really get the acceleration like he needed  He took a step and didn't get up  So that allowed me to keep following him  Normally, he explodes, and there's not many people that can meet him at the top  He didn't get the explosion on the layup that he needed. I just followed him, and that time I was just trying to make a play  He missed it, and luckily I was there to put it back in. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

I try to prevent that from happening, but it happened  D‑Wade came in and closed the quarter out  I wasn't going to leave until I saw what he was going to do  He drained and put us up ten, and I was all right."
2014-05-24,39:46,26.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"It seemed like this was really sort of the ultimate strategic test, maybe for Spo, the way he picked up the pace, went to pressure, the way he put Rashard on David West, the way you guys took advantage of West guarding Ray and then Norris' energy  Did you just sort of feel that you guys started to push the right buttons along the way?Â  How does it feel when you see your coach pushing those buttons and getting the results you guys desperately needed?","He definitely did that by putting the right personnel on the floor  Obviously, we started the game with mental turnovers, mental breakdowns, mostly coming from us offensively  He pushed the right buttons, bringing in Norris, giving Rashard a nod, Bird came in with his energy every night he plays. Those guys off the bench, man, they did it for us tonight  They got the game ball for sure."
2014-05-24,39:46,26.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, after you guys got through that first quarter, did you feel like the rest of the game this is as close as you've gotten to playing the style of game that you guys want to enforce in this series?","Well, for us, we have to play our type of basketball  We have to be disruptive  We have to speed up the team that we're going against, and we have to fly around defensively. When we lay back, we're just‑‑ everything that we've built, it just doesn't work  We just lay back and allow teams to come down and set up their offense‑‑ or whatever the case may be, even offensively, when we're just passing the ball around and being very passive. We're an attack team  When we get into our game, so many things happen for us, and we're even able to cover up for some of the mistakes we make both offensively and defensively."
2014-05-24,39:46,26.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you guys ran a lot of great sets to get Ray open in the fourth quarter  Was that a conscious change in strategy, or does that kind of just happen organically, when he hits a couple of shots, you all try to get him open?","Ray creates so much for our team, just his ability just to move without the ball, to shoot the ball  He shifts the defense by himself, and it's a great‑‑ I mean, it's great that we have that. No matter who's on him, him coming off pin‑downs, he's one of the few on our team that can do that, that can create two on the ball, and he's always in constant motion  He's got it going, man, and we just want to continue to find him. I was able to find him for the majority of the shots that he had tonight in the fourth quarter, and when you got a hot hand, you just keep going to it."

But we're a confidence group  We don't panic  We just work the game  Obviously, the start of the game, it wasn't the type of basketball that we're accustomed to playing  We turned the ball over way too much, and myself and a couple other guys had a few turnovers. But we just got into our game  We kept going, getting into our game  We started putting pressure on them defensively, offensively, and we were able to get back into the game at the end of the second quarter."
2014-05-24,39:46,26.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, can you just talk about the play from Norris Cole tonight, especially defensively when he was pressuring their guards, Watson and Stephenson?","Norris, he's great  He's great for our team  He's a change of pace from‑‑ we have our starting point guard in Rio, and when we go to Norris, he changes the tempo  That's when you need with guys off the bench, you need energy guys  We have a few of them, but Norris, he's great. He's been in‑‑ this is his third year  He's still young, but he's been in all the pressure situations, obviously, so he's able to come in and be confident  As the leaders of the team, we try to give him confidence. Defensively, though, it's his mark  He makes his mark defensively  He makes us all step up our game defensively as well, and then offensively, whatever he gives us is always extra credit for us  He attacks the rim, gets himself looks, gets our great guys looks, and it's great to have him."
2014-05-24,39:46,26.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you mentioned all that Ray does to get himself open  Were you surprised at all that they've tried David West on him now in three straight games?Â  It seems like an unusual matchup for them to work on.","Not surprised  They've done it for two years  Two years straight, he's guarded Ray when we went small  So not surprised at all.

That's why Spo and Riles and those guys went out and got this team  It wasn't just about the game of basketball  It's about what they bring to the locker room as well  To insert U.D. back into the starting lineup and then take him out and insert Rashard  Or when D‑Wade went down and Toney Douglas came in or J.J. came in in the Charlotte series  It's whatever  G.O.'s number could still get called  B's number could still get called  Those guys are ready  That's the type of locker room we have. It makes it a lot easier for Coach when you have that type of luxury. DWYANE WADE:Â  I don't remember the question (laughing). Â He took care of it. LeBRON JAMES:Â  I took care of it  Don't worry about it  I got you."

We don't want to come back with a Game 6  We love our fans, obviously  We love being in Miami, but we want to try to close it out  But we're going to have to work for it  It's not going to be easy, not against this team  It's the No.1 team in the Eastern Conference, and they're there for a reason  So we look forward to the challenge."

He had 10 points in the first quarter  Should have had 12; he missed two free throws  I haven't seen that from him in a while, but he just got it going  We rode him that whole first quarter, and it gave us the 27‑19 lead."

At the end of the game, whatever the end results is, we can be satisfied with that if we brought our game  Everything else doesn't matter  When you get between the lines of the court, 94 feet, and you got to get in between, and you got to play it  That's all we try to worry about  We can't worry about nothing else."

So Spo called it, and I was able to‑‑ D‑Wade was able to make the pass  I was able to slice over the top to release pressure from him, make Hibbert back up into the lane, and that got him his first shot. That was the game plan for us  We've been talking about it the last couple of days, how are we going to get C.B. going?Â  It worked out for us tonight."

I mean, I'm just trying to win  We need one more game to get The Finals  That's my only concern  We put ourselves in a position to win tonight, and as competitors, as professionals, that's what we are  At the end of the day, we put ourself in a position to win  All the extra, whatever Lance wants to deal with, I don't really care about that."

So you just continue to help the guys from the bench, let them know what you can see when you're in foul trouble, and ways we can try to exploit them  But I'm much better on the floor than I am off of it for sure."

We'll focus on Game 6 now  Like I said before, we focus on the things that we can control and not the things we can't control  We learn from our mistakes  17 turnovers on the road for 21 points is definitely not winning basketball in no way, shape, or form  Like D‑Wade said, this game is imperfect  You cover for those mistakes  At the end of the day we put ourselves in position to win, and we look forward to the game on Friday."

Lance is Lance  He's going to do what he needs to do to help his team win  As to the leaders of our team, we're going to do what it takes to help our team win. The game is reffed by the refs  They ref how they see it  We play it, and you live with the results."

For me, my teammates trust me that I'm going to make the right play to help us win  I trust myself that I'm going to make the right play to help us win  And win, lose, or draw, you live with that  I don't‑‑ it doesn't matter from somebody else's perspective. We got a great look  C.B. makes that shot, then we go, we get a stop, and we're headed to The Finals  So it's a make‑or‑miss league  You don't think about things you could do in the past  You just correct them in the future."

DWYANE WADE:Â  (Laughing) That's the second time that's happened to you. LeBRON JAMES:Â  That's the second time it's happened to me, right? DWYANE WADE:Â  It's the second time it's happened to you.

2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, when did it sort of dawn that this could be a special night that you guys would maybe have your ultimate game?Â  Was it yesterday in practice?Â  Was it the walk‑through and shootaround today?Â  Was it just when it got going?Â  When did you sort of know that you absolutely hit your stride in this game?","I mean, I don't know  I would say it had to be at the end of the first quarter we started to get a good groove, started to get a good groove, and we were down 9‑2 to start the game  From that point on, they only scored four points  It's crazy  They scored four points from that point on. We just locked in and got a good groove  I think it started with Bird coming into the game  His rebounding, his effort that he gave us when he came into the game gave us six defensive rebounds, gave us three buckets from drives from Norris and guys, and his dunk and his layup, I think that's what picked us up. And then Rashard was, obviously, the key to everything  His ability to stretch the floor, shoot the ball, and play the way he played tonight  Once those guys got it going, I think we all fed off of it."
2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you took a lot of lumps earlier in your career from teams like Boston that were determined to kind of mentally shake you as part of their game plan  How much, if any, did those experiences help you get past all the goofiness of Lance Stephenson and the other stuff they were trying to do to you in this series?","I always believe, a really good friend of mine told me that the best teacher in life is experience  When you go through so many things, you're able to learn from it  You're able to know how to go about it  Next time you face those trials and tribulations or whatever the case may come, and you're better prepared for it. So being around a group of guys like this, me being in positions that I've been in the past where I've failed, but I was never defeated  That was, for me, to be able to come back from failure and continue to come back and mentally be able to stay strong, it defines who you are as a man more than anything."
2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, to use a word that Spo often coins, there was noise all year about Indiana's drive to win the East, and you look at the standings at one point, they were obviously comfortably up most of the year  Did doubt ever seep into the room at all that you guys would end up being in the position you're in right now?","Not at all  Not at all  I felt like‑‑ I told the guys before the Eastern Conference or whatever, before the season even‑‑ before the playoffs started, that this was going to be our path  It's different  We're going to have to win on the road  We're going to have to start on somebody else's floor in order to be able to represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals. The guys, we all responded  We all took that challenge  Obviously, we had the first two rounds on our floor, but we knew, if Indiana took care of business, we had to start on their floor, and we just had that mindset  We had that mindset, if we want to ultimately represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals, we had to win on the road, and we were able to accomplish that."
2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"Dwyane, for you, you're going to have another rematch, whether it's OKC or San Antonio  Anything you learned‑‑",Not for me?Â  I wasn't here?

2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you mentioned that you knew your path would be different  You told the guys this  But did you think, as you were kind of going through uneven stretches in the regular season, Dwyane being out for long periods of time, that you would be able to get to this level, particularly defensively?Â  Did you think it was still in this team to get here?","I believe, if we ever got to a point where our whole team was able to be available for Spo and for all of us, that we could compete with anybody  Never concerned about that. Obviously, going through the week and week and week and grinding months of a regular season, it was a toll on all of us  But I felt like down the stretch, if we could get healthy, we could get everyone in uniform and have our full strength, it didn't matter what seed we were  I felt like we can represent the Eastern Conference again The Finals if we had the health, and we were able to accomplish that."
2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, how did you restrain yourself when Lance put his hand on your face?Â  And what was your reaction to his foul on Norris Cole?","I don't know  I have no idea how I restrained  I don't know  I guess I just understand what the bigger picture is. It was uncalled for, for sure  That was‑‑ I don't know  I'm at a loss of words with that, but it was uncalled for, and I was able to move on from it  I let him know how I felt. I felt it could have been‑‑ the fact that it was Lance that hit Norris, it was a little bit‑‑ you could have your own assumption of what it is  If it was C.J. Watson hitting Norris, we'd have said he went for the ball  The fact that it was Lance, we can say he went for his face  So wrong place at the wrong time‑‑ or at the right time for Lance, in his case."

2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, earlier Frank Vogel came in here  I know you've dealt with your share of comparisons over the course of your career, but he said he felt like you guys were the Chicago Bulls of this era and that you're the Michael Jordan of this era  When you hear something like that, how does it make you feel?Â  And do you feel this team is at that level?","Me and D‑Wade grew up watching the great Chicago Bulls team and the great Michael Jordan and the rest of those guys  Any time I hear my name or our team in the same breath with legends and great teams and franchises, it's so humbling, man  It's like‑‑ I really don't know  Just two kids from the inner cities, respective cities where they're from  We never thought we'd get to this point. So to be able to play the game that we love at a high level for one another, for our teammates, it's the ultimate  When you hear the comparisons, you respect it, you're humbled by it, and you just feel like while you're in the moment hopefully, while you're playing the game, that you can make an impact enough to where you move on and people will start comparing you to ones that's in the game at the present time. So it's very, very humbling."
2014-05-30,31:39,25.0,0.667,4.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, there was a lot of energy in this building from the opening tip  How much were you guys able to feed off of that right from the get go?","Not so well  We were down 9‑2  Obviously, we didn't do our part. But we knew our fans were going to come out  It's a Friday night in Miami  We have an opportunity to close out, and our fans have been amazing thus far  We just want to try to do our part. Obviously, the first couple minutes wasn't the start that we wanted, but we were able to get back into the game, and we just fed off the energy from our fans, fed off the energy from one another, and just kept it going."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"First, the obvious  How are you feeling?","I'm feeling better than I did when I came off the floor  So, doing better."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,You were going to try to give it a go?,"I was going to try to give it a go and Spo said no  It sucks at this point in time in the season  You know, after I made that layup we was down two and, you know, as well as they played we still had a chance  You know, after I came out of the game, they kinda took off  And it was frustrating sitting out and not be able to help our team."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,Is it just frustration?Â  Is it anger?,"Yeah, it's both  I mean, it's frustration and anger, but at the same time it's something that you try to prevent, you try to control  I mean, I got all the fluids I need to get, I do my normal routine I've done and it was inevitable for me tonight, throughout the conditions, you know, out there on the floor  I lost all the fluids that I was putting in in the last couple of days out there on the floor. It sucks not being out there for your team, especially at this point in the season."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"You tried to move, just saw the legs buckle on the baseline, how much pain were you in?","The best option for me to do was not to move  I tried and any little step or nudge, it would get worse  It would lock up worse and my muscles spasmed 10 out of 10  Best thing for me to do was just not to move, and, you know, it was frustrating."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,Was it just the left leg or was there more?,"Well, no, it was the whole left leg, damn near the whole left side  I was losing a lot throughout the game  It was extremely hot in the building, you know, both teams, fans, everybody could feel it  I was the one that had to take the shot."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,What did you try and do at halftime?Â  Did you have any idea how much fluid you tried to get in you?,"Drank a lot at halftime, even changed my uniform, just tried to get the sweat up off of you  Our training staff tried to do the best they could by giving us ice bags and cold towels on timeouts, keep us dry. It was an unusual circumstance, I never played in a building like that, it's been a while, like high school game or CYO and everybody is sitting on top and you feel good being in a building like that. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's no discredit for what they did  They played extremely well  They moved the ball extremely well  I think they had 30 assists  You know, even from the turnovers both teams were committing, uncharacteristic of both teams, they played extremely well."
2014-06-05,32:53,25.0,0.529,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"You have nearly three full days now before you have to play again, how thankful are you that you have the extra day in between?","I need it, I need it, I need it  We're going to start tonight, continue to get the fluids in me and get me ready for Sunday  Thankful for the fact that I can get on it tonight, and put myself in a position where I can be out there for my team for the long haul  And sitting on the sideline, you know, if I'm not in foul trouble, is not good for us and not good for me  Look forward to Game 2 and go from there FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, for all the heat that you've taken at times for the ""right basketball play"", how rewarding was it that C.B. knocked down that three?Â  And how did you see that play develop?","It was rewarding in that it was a huge play to help us win  I just seen it develop the whole time, and I wanted to try to put some pressure towards the rim, and I caught Tim Duncan peeking at me a little bit  And I was able to find C.B. in the corner in one of his favorite spots on the floor and he knocked it down."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, because you beat the Spurs in The Finals last year and won two in a row, do you think seeds of doubt creep into their minds, especially late in the game and in the fourth quarter?","That's not our concern  All we worry about is what we can control and that's just how we play the game, how we approach the game both physically and mentally  And we live with the results."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,What made you decide to take on the scoring duties in the third quarter and what made you not try to win it on your own in the fourth?,"Just play the game, try to play the game the right way  However the flow of the game is going, I just try to impose my will in some kind of way, either scoring or rebounding or assisting or defending  Put myself and my teammates in a position to succeed, and I was happy in the fact that I was able to make some plays to help us get the victory tonight."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,You dressed a little differently tonight than you did in Game No. 1  Can you talk about the decision process and how that affected you on the court?,"Didn't affect me at all  I've been going with the longer tights throughout the playoffs; decided to go with the shorter ones today  I don't know, I was watching Game 2 of our Finals appearance versus OKC in 2012, and I didn't have long tights on in that game, so that's why I didn't wear them tonight  Just a little crazy on my part."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,How big did the basket look to you?Â  You hadn't taken a jumpshot until the third quarter  How big did the basket seem once you started putting that up?,"For me once I get into a good groove, I feel like everything is going to go in  Obviously it didn't  I made a couple of shots in a row, and then missed the elbow jumpshot over Tim, and they made a run after that. But for me I just try to make plays out there on the floor, and like I continue to say, put myself and my teammates in a position to succeed and live with the results after that."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what got you going in the second quarter after your slow start in the first quarter?","I just continued to attack  I had a slow start, but all my misses was in the paint  My first miss was a shot over Tim and Tiago; I missed it  I missed a spinning layup in the lane  I missed a banker over Tony Parker  I just got off to a slow start  Then I drove the lane and got my foot tangled up a little bit and threw up a wild shot I started 1‑for‑5  I was confident in where I was getting on the floor and I had to stick with it."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,After those two offensive rebounds in the second quarter how physically drained were you?Â  It looked like you asked to come out of the game.,"For me, at that point in the game, yeah, I was tired  I got two offensive rebounds  Was able to go back up with them  Put some pressure on their defense  So Spo was very, very consistent and great with his adjustments today as far as the personnel, in and out guys, in and out  And when I asked to come out, he took me out and I was able to go back in."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, after what you were dealing with the last 48 hours, at what point in the game did you know that your legs were there for you and were going to respond?Â  And did you do anything else differently to try to make sure you could get through this game?","You know, I didn't really try to think about it too much  One thing I did do differently this morning, I took an 8 a.m. yoga class at our resort that we stayed at outside  Me, and three other people and also a little kid but he didn't want no parts of it  So that's probably the only thing that I did differently today."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,I assume that was not hot yoga.,"Nah, it started to rain a little bit this morning, actually  About 8:35 it started to rain."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"When you were able to come out of the game tonight, how did it feel to have air conditioning?","Well, I mean, mentally I didn't want to even think about it too much  What happened on Thursday was Thursday  My whole focus was how was it going to help this team even the series up and just try to make some plays."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,You dominated from the perimeter in the second half. Â Was that an adjustment you made at halftime from what you saw or did you just take what the defense gave you essentially?,"It wasn't an adjustment  In the first half, you know, I got into the paint, made some shots, got some rebounds, put pressure on their defense  In the second half they backed up off me and I shot it. It was that easy for me in the sense of don't overthink it  They give me space, I shoot it  They get up on me, I try to drive and make plays for me and my teammates  They're going to make adjustments going into Game 3, and I have to do it as well  But I don't want to cloud my mind too much with what they're doing defensively  I want their defense to react to what I'm doing."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"In the last couple of days have you had any fans send any remedies, things to avoid cramps, things of that nature?","I've heard it all  I've heard it all  I just stay with my plan  Our training staff and our medical team, we do a great job of just doing what we usually do. Â We didn't want to complicate things  I think the two and a half bags after a game of IV helped me out a lot  Like I said, I didn't try to think about it too much tonight."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"After Tim and Tony missed those four free throws, you score five straight. Â In a situation like that when a team misses an opportunity, do you smell blood a little bit there?Â  What were you thinking?","I thought it was a tough call to start it off, with Rio getting the flagrant one  I thought it was an inadvertent elbow  I didn't think it was intentional  So Tony missed two and Tim went up and missed two as well  Just wanted to capitalize off their mistakes and just try to put some pressure on their defense. We got some great looks, we made 'em tonight  And the biggest thing for us, we got stops as well when we needed it  That helped us win this game."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"You talked the other day about how scrutinized you are and living in this fishbowl that you've lived in for a long time  What has helped you cope with that, deal with that and live with this altered reality that you have?","I've got a great supporting cast around me that allows me to vent at times  Try not to hold it in  I also understand at this point in my life what's important and what's not important and what's important is my teammates, what's important is my two kids at home, my wife, my family and my friends  That's what I can control and that's what's important to me. Obviously the game of basketball has brought me so much, and I love to play this game at a high level  And without this game, I wouldn't be who I am today  But I also know what's important  Everything else kind of just fall by the wayside."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,A lot of your teammates said they have had to learn just not to care what's said about them or criticism or anything like that  Do you also have to push all that to the side?,"You have to  It's very difficult at times, very challenging, but for me, I'm here and I know who I'm playing for and what I'm playing for and what I stand for, not only as a basketball player but as man and as a role model  I know what I stand for. To be able to put an NBA uniform on every single night with my name on the back, knowing where I come from, let's me know that I've done something special  I just try to give back to the game as much as I can while I'm here."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,Can you just talk about how big Rashard Lewis was for you guys tonight  He's a player that hasn't played a lot of minutes this season but he's been stepping up big for you guys.,"Rashard has been huge for us ever since he's been inserted into our starting lineup, from the Indiana series. He's been in this position before  He's been to the Finals with Orlando Magic  He's been in huge playoff games, and his experience and ability to knock down shots helps us out a lot  It spreads the floor for us, and every time he catches the ball, we tell him just to shoot it  Don't think about nothing else besides shooting the ball, and we live with his results."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"Talk about the importance of keeping them out of the paint down the stretch of the game, not only tonight but for the games going forward.","I think that's a key going into any game  When a team lives in the paint, it puts so much pressure on your defense and it allows paint points obviously  But when guys get into the paint it shrinks the defense, and they get to kick out for their threes, which they did a couple times tonight  Danny Green had one, Tony hit one, Patty Mills had a couple  We got to do a better job of shrinking the floor and not allowing them to get in the paint. They will, they will get into the paint some, but as much as we can limit the penetration, it will help us out a lot."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,What has to continue as a whole offensively and defensively so you can have more success the rest of the way?,"Offensively we want to share the ball and not turn the ball over  We're a team that shoots the ball extremely high from the field, very efficient offensively  We get ourselves in trouble when we turn the ball over  It doesn't allow us to set our defense  We're a really good half‑court defense, we're a solid pick‑and‑roll defense  And when we're solid offensively, we don't turn the ball over, we're going to get an opportunity to make something happen."
2014-06-08,37:36,35.0,0.636,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, Chris missed the corner three on the shot before he made one  Do you ever let stuff like that influence your decision and why or why not?","Not at all  If you're on the floor at that point in time, you can make a play  You can make a shot, a steal, a rebound  You can do whatever it takes to help us win  For me, when the ball is in my hands, I'm going to make the right play  To have that trust from my teammates, they know when I got the ball, I'm going to make the right play  Doesn't mean it's going to go in  Doesn't mean it's going to result in a win, but they believe in my ability to do that. You know, C.B. had just missed one, got a great look, but if I draw two and his man leave him again, I went right back to him and he knocked it down  I got a lot of confidence in my teammates and they got a lot of confidence in me and we live with the results no matter what happens.

We're going to come in and learn from our mistakes, as we always do after a loss, and get ready and prepared from the beginning  You know, this is the last team in the NBA that you can dig yourself a hole against  You just can't do it, and we learned from that tonight."
2014-06-10,39:49,22.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,0,"Was this one of those games where, was it the defense or where it was like, man, they're hitting everything?","I think it was a little bit of everything  It was a cumulative of everything  Some possessions we played extremely well and they hit shots  Some possessions we weren't quite there and they hit shots as well  One thing about this team, if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay, and they made us pay more often than not tonight from some of the mistakes that we made defensively."
2014-06-10,39:49,22.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,0,"LeBron, you were in such a great rhythm in Game 2  Really played well in Game 1  But tonight you committed a Finals record 7 turnovers  How disappointed were you in your own performance?","I was in a pretty good rhythm tonight as well  I just turned the ball over way too much  I had two at halftime, I had five in the second half, and some of them were trying to make some plays to my teammates, and some of them were just overdribbling at times. So I've got to do a better job with that for sure  It's not surprising that I have a Finals record for something I don't want to have, you know, so there we go  It's a new storyline for LeBron."
2014-06-10,39:49,22.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,0,"And for a team that is now in its fourth Finals, how do you explain coming out with such a lack of urgency in a game at home?","I don't think we had a lack of urgency  Just they were very aggressive and we didn't match that  They came in with a desperation that we just didn't match. Just because it's our fourth Finals doesn't mean anything  That doesn't guarantee you a win  It doesn't guarantee you that you'll be more urgent or less urgent than the next team  You just have to prepare for each and every game  We've got to have a better performance in Game 4, for sure  We definitely can't get behind this team like we did tonight."
2014-06-10,39:49,22.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,0,You guys obviously probably don't expect Mario and Norris to have to match Tony and Patty Mills  But what can you get from those guys to be more consistent in this series?Â  What do you expect from that position?,"Well, we want them to run the offense and we want them to defend  When they get open looks, we want them to take them with confidence  When they have an opportunity, we want them to be aggressive  Obviously, with Tony and Patty, those guys are very high motors, so we want them to match that effort. One thing you can't control in the game of basketball if a shot goes in or not, but you can control how you defend  You can control how much energy you bring to the game, how much effort you bring to the game  If our two point guards do that, we can be okay with that  I know our two point guards, they're very passionate  They've got a lot of pride  And I know they're looking forward to learning from what they did tonight, and trying to be much better in Game 4."
2014-06-10,39:49,22.0,0.643,5.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,0,"LeBron, it seems like even when they're missing they're getting good, quality looks  What is it about that offense that's so tough to defend?","Well, they spread you out  They have multiple guys that can make plays  It's kind of like us  They share the ball extremely well, and those guys are always in the right spot  I mean, if they ran the set and closed their eyes, they know exactly where the guys going to be at  It's a system they've been in  They do a great job of feeling one another out  And every guy that's on the floor can make a play  You know, it's very challenging mentally and physically for a defense  So you always have to be in tune."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you left just before the start of the game, came back, and then left in the first quarter  Was there any illness or injury or something that might have held you back tonight?","No, first time I left I went to go get retaped, retape my ankle  It's been kind of bothering me for the last couple days, but I felt okay  Second time I went back, I just had to use the restroom."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"Obviously, it's not over, but you know the numbers as well as anybody in the league  You know that nobody in the Finals has ever come back from 3‑1 down  What is the attitude right now?Â  Is it just about Sunday?Â  Is it about making history?Â  Is it something else?Â  What is it right now?","Well, I mean, man, we put ourselves in a position where it is about making history  But all we can do is worry about Game 5  We've got to worry about Sunday first  Try to go up there in a hostile environment, where we were able to steal one in Game 2, and try to get another one and go on from there. Obviously, I do know the numbers  It's never been done before, but we're still a confident bunch, even though our heads are lowered down right now  Of course, being down 3‑1, and losing two straight games at home, that's just human nature  But we've still got to go out and play on Sunday."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you got going with the big third quarter scoring‑wise, what was it like at the end of that to look up and see that you had actually lost ground on the scoreboard during that?","That didn't mean nothing, you know  If it's not helping us get into the game, it didn't mean nothing  I tried to will us back into the game, but they continued to execute  I continued to make shots  I had a huge third quarter, but it meant nothing."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"Erik said this was surprising tonight, and Chris said overall it was kind of blindsiding what happened in these two games  What was your reaction at the end when you were watching the last few minutes on the bench?","I mean, they smashed us  Two straight home games, got off to awful starts  They came in and were much better than us in these two games  It's just that simple."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"Have you ever in two games had a team be more successful moving you strong to weak, getting the ball to the weak side and finishing plays as San Antonio has the last two games?","I mean, coming into the series we knew that that's what it was going to be about  They're a high‑oil machine and they move the ball extremely well  They put you in so many difficult positions  If you're not right on time, right on target, they're going to make you pay for it."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, as a follow‑up, is there any real doubt creeping in at this point that they just may be better or is it something you still feel like you have to figure out?","Well, I mean, the series is not over  We've got guys with too much pride to even start thinking about that  At the end of the day, our focus will be, how do we get better than we did in Game 3 and Game 4 here at home?Â  We're going with that bunker mentality in Game 5. Like D Wade said, we'll get away from it tomorrow physically  Mentally it will still be lingering around  Saturday you start to get back into the flow of things, and then Sunday you go out and play and see what happens."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, you talked about their ball movement a little bit, is it just about doing things harder or are there tactical adjustments that need to be made in your guys' view?",That sounds like a set‑up question.
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"No, not really.","Not really?Â  Man, they move the ball extremely well  They put you in positions that no other team in this league does, and it's tough because you have to cover the ball first, but also those guys on the weak side can do multiple things  They can shoot the ball from outside, they can also penetrate  So our defense is geared towards running guys off the three‑point line, but at the same time those guys are getting full steam ahead and getting to the rim, too. The challenge is as well, with them, implementing Diaw into the lineup has given them another point guard on the floor  So Manu, Tony, and Diaw and Patty Mills on the floor at once, they've got four point guards basically on the floor at once  So all of them are live and they all can make plays. Â So it's a challenge for us all."

For me, I'm here at this point  I'm here with the 3‑1 deficit, and me as one of the leaders of the team, I have to figure out a way to get us to a 3‑2 deficit  And you worry about that, and everything else that's happened before you, you can't control it at this point."

2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"When you go back home in the next couple of days, having two days off, it's a long time between games, and a lot of time to think  How will you guys roll this around in your mind?Â  What kind of soul‑searching has to take place, and how much will that help you come back for Sunday strong?","Soul‑searching, there won't be much of that  There won't be much of that at all for me  Crazy thing is my two boys are running around in the locker room after the game was over, so I had no time to even think about the game anymore  They want to know what's going on right when we get home  So having my boys around will allow me to get away from the game  But I will still be in tune with what I need to do to help our team win, and that's my mindset. But as far as soul‑searching, we're a veteran ballclub that's won a championship, that's won a couple championships, that's been to four straight Finals  We know what it takes to win  We've just got to go out and do it. DWYANE WADE:Â  I think the biggest thing you can do is first individually  There's no ""I"" in team  There is an ""I"" in individual  You have to look at yourself and see what you can bring better to the game to be able to help this team  Then as a team we've got to continue to trust and believe in each other, like we've done for four years here, like we've done all season  I'm confident that we will do that. I mean, you've just got to look at yourself first, and then after that, we look at each other and see how we can all help each other get better."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"LeBron, at times it seems as if the offense is struggling and stagnant, asking you to go one‑on‑one, shoot deep threes, be amazing  Can you talk about that pressure and how it might be mentally taxing on you after four years now?","I don't really get caught up in what pressure is all about  I mean, just go out and play basketball, play as hard as you can and live with the results  For me, I do whatever it takes to help our team win  If it's me going one‑on‑one to try to help us win, if it's me getting guys involved and taking threes in rhythm, then I'll do it  But I don't really get caught up in the pressure."
2014-06-12,37:39,28.0,0.588,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0,"Is it mentally exhausting?Â  I don't think in any of the games you guys have had a lead in the first quarter, to have to come back from so many deficits and all of that on your shoulder?","You definitely don't want to‑‑ it's not on my shoulder  It's not  I understand I get a lot of the limelight in the press and all that, but it's not all on my shoulder  I take a lot of it, but I do it for my teammates and I want them to put a lot of pressure on me in that sense. But going into the first quarter is how you start games off, and you don't ever want to go into the second quarter being down  But it is what it is  That is the way the series has played out thus far  You know, we have another game on Sunday to kind of right the ship and get better from it, and not be down like we've done in these first four games, because it's not been a successful ingredient for us."

Like I said, I haven't even thought about it yet."

Take 50% in four years in championships any day  Obviously, you want to win all of them, but that's just the nature of the game  You win some; you lose some  You've just got to come back the next year and be better as an individual, as a team, and go from there. But I know me and D. Wade and C.B., not proud of the way we played  All three of us, that's the last thing we're thinking about is what's going on this summer."

DWYANE WADE:Â  Yeah, it's like he just played free  You could tell after the first two games, it seemed like his teammates went to him and said just play basketball  He not only took what the defense gave him, he took what he wanted at times as well. So he's a young player who is growing up in this league, and everyone knows what Coach Pop says:Â  He's the future of this team  And he did an unbelievable job of playing the role they needed him to play."

Three years ago, our first year here, that was probably more hurtful than this one in the sense of we had put so much into it, we were going through so much  That Dallas team was the better team in that series as well. Obviously, they all hurt  This year they dominated us from every facet of the game‑‑ offensively, defensively  I mean, they all hurt, but I've been able to be a part of five of them, and I would love to sit up here and say I was 5‑0, but I'm not  I'm 2‑3  But a lot of guys don't get this opportunity to even compete for a championship, and I've been blessed to compete for five of them in my 11 years so far."

The Spurs continue to get better  Obviously, they kept those three guys intact, but they continue to put guys around them, high‑basketball‑IQ guys around them, high‑energy guys around them that fit into the system of what Pop wanted to do. Obviously, it's not just about the Spurs  It's about the whole league  The whole league is excited about returning next season, and we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

Smith, who's able just to shoot the ball and have the extreme confidence that every time they let it go, that it's going in  I've been blessed to play with guys like that. When you have guys like that, you have to utilize them while they're on the floor."

We're the number one defensive team in the playoffs, and it has a lot to do with when we go out, as a coaching staff, they give us the game plan  And for us as players, we go out and execute it  For us to win ultimately, we have to defend. Tonight we shot 44 percent from the field, but we defended  We gave ourselves a chance  When you defend at a high level, you give yourself a chance to win every night. J.R. SMITH:Â  I just try to just roll with the punches  I mean, once the team pretty much starts closing out, just try to get in attack mode, and at the same time, try to find my teammates  It's kind of hard, hitting the shots I was hitting, to try and pass the ball, but you've got to figure out a way."
2015-05-20,38:02,31.0,0.462,8.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you touched on it a little bit, but two quick questions:Â  What was it that you saw in J.R. that made you very in favor of bringing him to Cleveland?Â  Number two, what type of satisfaction do both of you get after having a game like this against the Hawks?","Me and J.R.'s history go back long before he came into the NBA  Before he came into the NBA, he came to my hometown, and we worked out multiple days, multiple times  For me, as a leader of a team, you always just want to try to give someone an opportunity  With the talent this guy presents, I knew the man he was, and I didn't really care about what everybody else thought about him. Obviously, our front office, they have the last say so, and for me, they have the last say so, but when they made it and said they were going to do it, I was definitely all for it  I felt like, for me, we were getting a great piece, not only on the floor, but off the floor, as well, because I'd known him before he even got to this point. To answer your second question, to be able just to make plays to help your team win is all that matters for me  We have a guy like this that was shooting the ball extremely well, who broke the game open, but also the contributions from Delly off the bench again, and the two bigs, both of them having double‑doubles  That was big time."
2015-05-20,38:02,31.0,0.462,8.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"Two questions:Â  One, could you take us through what happened in the third quarter, I think when you stepped on the camera guy  And then, two, after some really good quarters offensively, second and third quarter, you guys seemed to get out of rhythm a little bit in the fourth  What happened there until you finished with that dunk?","Like you said, in the third quarter, I went to contest DeMarre Carroll's three‑point attempt, and the cameraman, I guess his foot was out further than it should be, but I stepped on his foot and turned my ankle. I'm happy that it didn't cost me the rest of the game  I was able to go out there and make a few plays. I think, to answer your second question, we can't worry about how many points we're up or how many points we're down; we have to continue to play our game  It starts with me  I take all the responsibility for it  In fourth quarter, I played way too much isolation basketball, one‑on‑one basketball, a lot of defenses set, and I was letting the clock run down way too much  I just had to take the shot or I was giving it to my guys late in the shot clock, and they couldn't do nothing with it besides shoot it or turn the ball over. So I will do a better job  I'll probably watch the game over again tonight, as I try to get my body ready for Game 2  So it starts with me."
2015-05-20,38:02,31.0,0.462,8.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what Kyrie's going through right now, can you say anything to him?Â  Is this something that he has to become resigned to the fact that maybe the rest of the playoffs he'll be laboring through these injuries?","It's tough, and I know it sucks for him  This is the moment he's been waiting for  This is the biggest stage  Physically, he's not capable of doing what we all know he's capable of doing, and it's starting to, I guess‑‑ hopefully, it doesn't continue‑‑ or hopefully it doesn't get into his mind  For me, that's my role at that point, to let him know when he's on the floor, no matter what he's going through, we need him to be aggressive, as aggressive as he can be with the injury, and not worry about things that he cannot control; only worry about the things that he can control. Like I said, that will be my job to help him understand, no matter what he's going through physically, never let it creep into his mind where it affect him mentally."
2015-05-20,38:02,31.0,0.462,8.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you mentioned the defense in the postseason for you guys, giving up 51 to Atlanta in the first half and then 38 the rest of the way  What changed in the second half for you?","We started to get kind of a rhythm of what they wanted to do, but we also just put pressure not only at the point of attack, but when the ball was moved from side to side. Like I said, our coaching staff gives us a game plan, and it's up to us to execute it  They're going to make shots  They're one of the, if not the best with Golden State, best offenses we have in our league  We just try to make it tough on them."
2015-05-20,38:02,31.0,0.462,8.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you mentioned the iso ball  Do you know, in the midst of it, in the middle of the game, can you feel it slowing down?Â  Can you feel you're doing it too much?Â  Or is it only after the game when you can kind of decompress a little bit and look at the numbers?","I kind of sense it  I sense it during the game a little bit, and it's tough sometimes with our main ball handler not being on the floor, and that's in Kyrie  That's something that I'm not happy with, something I'm not really comfortable with doing  I can do it, but I don't like to play that much isolation basketball late in the game  I'd much rather get the ball moving from side to side and get a good look after that. So like I said, I'll be more conscious about that in Game 2, if that opportunity presents itself, where at least I can get the ball moving to start and then maybe at the back side, or like the third option I can get it back at the end  At least we got the defense moving instead of them just watching me pound the ball for 24 seconds  That's not good basketball."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, what goes into those kinds of passes and how difficult are they, and how have you perfected that over the course of time?","I've just seen every coverage that defenses can offer me, and I always try to be a triple threat on the floor, being able to score, to rebound, to pass, whatever the case may be, however the game presents itself  Just get my confidence‑‑ I give my teammates the utmost confidence that when I throw them the ball, to shoot with confidence  I just try to put it exactly where they need it to be, where all they've got to do is catch and shoot or catch and drive and make things happen. So it's something I learned when I was a youngster, understanding how important a pass is and how important it is giving your teammates confidence  When you have guys like the guy next to me and Delly and J.R. and the rest of the guys on down the line, I'm able to do what I love to do best."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you guys collected more than a quarter of your shots today via offensive rebound  How valuable was that for building the lead?","Well, for us, offensive rebounding is part of our game  Three‑point shooting is a part of our game as well  We get 30 looks at the three‑point line, and we had 11 offensive rebounds that converted into 13 second‑chance points  That's all a part of our game, it's part of our DNA  When we do that, we're very successful."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,Atlanta was collapsing early on your drives to the basket and then we saw later in the game an uptick of you driving and then dishing out  Was that an adjustment made based off how they were collapsing on defense?,"I'm able to make adjustments throughout the game, just knowing how the defense read and react  Obviously, when you've got guys like here, who shot the ball extremely well tonight, the defense starts to go further and further away from the paint, and I'm able to see creases  When they react to me, I'm going to find my guys  I'm going to know exactly where they're going to be every single time I drive  That's just a repetition we have through our practices and watching the film and knowing where your guys are going to be, and they have outlets, and they make themselves presentable, and I just try to put the ball right where it needs to be. I'm able to gauge the game and watch the game and able to replay it back in my mind and understand what I can do to help us win."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, I guess it's sort of along those lines, but if you go back to after Game 1 of the Chicago series, it was your first game without Kevin, and you said with less offense on the floor you had kind of decided you would need to shoot more and play a certain way  When you come in tonight and Kyrie's not out there either and you have this game that you had with 11 assists and dishing it all over the place, just what made you switch again to playing, I guess, more of the point forward, distributor?","That's how the game presented itself  When I was attacking, I was seeing guys open  When they were bringing two to me, I was seeing guys open  Like I said, I have the most confidence, the most confidence in my teammates to make shots and make plays. For me, that's my job is to put energy behind that ball when I'm finding them  All they need to do is catch and shoot or catch and drive or make a play, and the game presented that tonight  I was able to be aggressive at times getting to the rim, and then there was times where they brought two and three guys towards me, and I was able to find my guys, and they knocked them down."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,Earlier in the season when you passed Pippen for the all‑time assists by a forward  You told us the assist is your favorite play in basketball  I wonder if you could elaborate on why that is and the feeling you get when you help these guys score.,"Why that is, for me, more than scoring, you always get the excitement of two guys being able to benefit from a pass  If I score the ball, if I'm in an iso situation where I score the ball, it's just me, and I've always been accustomed to team basketball  When I'm able to put pressure on the defense and then make a pass to a teammate and he's able to knock it down, I've always got the excitement of that more than anything. But I have a gift, and that's why I'm able to keep defenses off guard because, you know, they say, okay, we're going to make him score or make him pass  They really can't make me do what I don't want to do  I go out, and I play the game the right way  And whatever that moment, that possession presents itself, I try to do what's best for our team at that very moment."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, two nights ago, you said you had the No. 1 defense in the postseason  It's hard pressed to find too many stretches of the year where you guys were a top ten defense  Why now?Â  What's going on that has made you guys so good in the playoffs?","We've gotten smarter  We've ramped up our communication to a level that, at times throughout the season, I didn't know we could get to, and we're flying around, and we're just helping one another in time of need. It starts with this guy, first of all  Look at those all‑defensive teams, and obviously he has a small window with us, but he will be on the all‑defensive team in this league very soon  It starts with him, his approach  I love the defensive side  You have a guy like Dellavedova, who he takes a challenge and Double‑T protecting the rim  Mozzy as well in the starting lineup tonight  And everyone else, everyone takes it seriously. We understand that ultimately, if we want to win long term, we have to defend  It's going to give us the best possible chance to win because the ball don't go through the rim all the time, and you have to be able to get stops  We've been able to do that thus far in our 4, 10, 12 games in the postseason."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,What are you all doing at halftime?Â  You come out in the third quarter the last two games and shut them down  What adjustments and what have you all seen in your game plan?,"It's a total 360 from our last series  We were terrible in the third quarter versus the Bulls  We understood, if we want to be really good, we have to come out with a little bit more sense of urgency  We have to play more pedal to the metal in the third quarter. Defensively, we've been locked in  When the ball is entered, either if it's their possession or it's our possession, we've just been very, very in tune with the game plan, and that's allowed us to get some leads in the third quarter and push the game out of reach."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, both of you guys talked about what you've done defensively  They've talked a lot about how they haven't played Hawks basketball  They've played more iso than they typically play  How much do you think what you guys have done, in terms of stopping their initial actions, has had to do with forcing them to play that way?","(Laughing)  How do I want to answer this question?Â  We're the No.1 defensive team in the postseason for a reason  Obviously, it's a great offensive team that we're playing against  You can't stop a great offensive team  You just try to make it tough on them  That's all we're trying to do  We're just trying to make it tough on them every night‑‑ contest all their jump shots, be in tune with the game plan, keep a body on a guy like Korver, who can break open a game by himself. And that's all  That's all we can do  They're going to make shots, which they did tonight  They still made some shots  There were some possessions where we thought we could have been a little bit more in tune, but we just try to make it tough on them  That's all we can ask, and our coaching staff gives us the game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute it, and that's what we've been doing so far in these first two games."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, do you ever think about just some of the guys that these last couple of games, you always, when you come up to the podium, you've got different guys joining you every time  What does that say about your team?","It's next man up  Guys are just taking the challenge  It means everything to me to be able to share this podium with multiple teammates  On every given night, Delly and Shump and J.R. and Ky and Tristan  It could be James Jones next  It could be anybody. It means a lot  It means that, first of all, what they do, they do it very well  I got teammates that they don't try to outdo what they can do  They do what they do at a high level, and for me, I just try to lead them  Lead them the best way I can, and they go out and work for me, and I try to do the same for them."
2015-05-22,38:58,30.0,0.455,9.0,11.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, how important was it in the third quarter to keep the pedal down, build that lead up, and maybe not just for this game, but for momentum purposes going forward?","Well, we learned from Game 1  In Game 1 we had a big lead, and we started to play the clock, and that was my fault  I took that straight to the head  I knew, if I got that opportunity again, I wouldn't let that happen again. So we happen to have the same thing happen today, and we just kept our foot on the gas  We had early shots in the shot clock, we took them  If not, we executed, and we were able to continue our roll and continue to defend as well  That was very important."
2015-05-24,46:47,37.0,0.378,18.0,13.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, after Mack misses the second three there, you drop to the floor and kind of slap the floor  What was going through your mind at that point?","I gave it everything I had tonight  My teammates did  Played our tail off, and to be able to win the game like this, with so many ups and downs and so many lead changes, it's a huge win for our team."
2015-05-24,46:47,37.0,0.378,18.0,13.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, you started 0‑for‑10 tonight but still had an amazing stat line  Can you just take us through the slow start  What got you going?Â  And if you could, compare this to Game 5 in Detroit in '07.","I was struggling earlier  I missed a lot of shots that I know I'm capable of making, obviously  Missed a lot of layups  Missed a couple threes, and my teammates kept me afloat. I think I was 0‑for‑9 at the end of the first quarter, but it was 21‑24 at the end of the first quarter  We were in the game because of my teammates  They picked me up, and I just tried to do some other things while we were struggling offensively as far as shooting. For me, offense, as far as scoring, doesn't define my game  I've always wanted to be a triple threat in this league, being able to rebound and to assist and also to score  So when I wasn't scoring and those guys were picking me up, I was able to do other things to help us go. Every game is different as far as the Game 5 in Detroit  Compared to this game, it's so much different  It was a 2‑2 series at that point being in Detroit  Tonight is a 2‑0 series being back home  This is much different, but the win feels great."

2015-05-24,46:47,37.0,0.378,18.0,13.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, I've heard it said in the past, Larry Bird used to say that rebounding was mostly will  You had 20 rebounding opportunities; you grabbed 18 of them  Could you tell me about your will to rebound.","Well, we needed it tonight  We gave ourselves 19 offensive rebounds, extra possessions when we weren't shooting the ball well  For me, we played a lot of small ball tonight  But even when we're big, I just try to help our bigs out, try to help rebound  It's good offense for us when I'm able to rebound, able to push the break. Just being in that mindset that I tried to get every rebound possible that was in my lane  One or two I could have got, like you said, but just being in the mix and just helping us get extra possessions."

Even in the overtime, I asked to come out, but I had a second thought, and there was no way I can go‑‑ I wouldn't have felt right about the situation, win, lose, or draw, if I'd have went to the bench and not being out there for my teammates  So it was mind over matter at that point."

I think in the case of‑‑ ever since you were a kid, the ball on the floor, the first man to the floor usually gets the ball  There's no difference between what Delly did to Kyle Korver last game and 18 guys diving on the floor late in the game tonight  It was like six or seven guys diving on the floor for that loose ball  Delly was on the floor  J.J. was on the floor  Mike Scott was on the floor  Shump was on the floor  J.R. was on the floor  Just no one got hurt. There's no difference between me boxing out or Al Horford boxing me out and Delly boxing someone out  That is a fundamental box‑out  That's all it is  And we all know that  We don't never want to play with the integrity of the game and try to get people hurt  That's not what it's about because we all want brotherhood at the end of the day, NBA family  But I play to win the game, and you play aggressively  That's what it's about."

I just seen Paul Millsap running a little out of control, just gave him a pump fake, and I just stick to my routine  Things that I worked on all year long, make or miss, and I would be satisfied with the result."

Probably 23, 24, 25 maybe  I think just because I've had experience  It's not about the younger LeBron or anything like that  I've been able to have experience over the years that's helped me to get to this point  I really don't‑‑ my game is so much better than it was when I was younger, and I just try to‑‑ everything that I've worked on over the course of years and the mental side of the game, I just try to incorporate that on the floor, no matter if I'm making shots or missing shots or whatever the case may be."

MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:Â  I can answer if you want  I saw the ball  I dived on the floor  If I stay on my belly, it's going to be a jump ball  So I protect the ball and kick it out to a teammate. On the other one, I'm boxing him out  He's pulling my left arm down  I'm trying to stay up, and he's just pulling me down  I mean, the tape's there.

What I care about is how we prepare every single night, how we prepare in the film session, which we will have another one tomorrow, and how we go about trying to win a basketball game  That's going to get 99.9 percent of my mental  But I will protect my guys for sure."

I'm not the only guy that's limping  I'm not the only guy that's cramping  I'm not the only guy that's hurting  There's a lot of guys out there that's playing as well, and I'm one of them as well  So I've got to go out and help our team win, no matter where I'm at."
2015-05-24,46:47,37.0,0.378,18.0,13.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, could you talk about Shump and J.R., how big they were tonight, how big they've been to the Cavs  The defense they play, the big shots they hit, maybe the emergence of Matthew also, especially in the light of Kyrie and his absence and what they've meant to you guys.","Those three guys, obviously, J.R. and Shump, to answer the first part of your question, they were huge tonight  J.R. gives us a double‑double, and no one talks about it  Gives us 17 and 10  And obviously, what Shump does, he rebounds, he defends whoever you need him to defend, and he gives us 15 points tonight as well. And the guy next to me, he's been thrown into a situation that he wasn't thrown in all season for the most part, and that's starting, being our starting point guard, with Kyrie being absent the last couple games  And those three guys have answered the call  They've played exceptional basketball  They've defended  They've done everything we need them to do  We need them to do it a little bit more. It's just every game is going to be challenging  As hard as it was to win tonight, Game 4 is going to be just as hard as it was tonight  But those three guys are playing unbelievable basketball  Without them, we wouldn't be sitting here at this point.

2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, when you came back, you said you had a plan, you had a mission  Obviously, that's almost accomplished, but can you just talk to me about your emotions and what it's like to actually be in this position right now after‑‑ you know, even before you came here, you knew you had something going.","My emotions, it's very emotional to be back in this city  When I made my decision to come back here, I knew what I wanted to do, but I knew it wasn't going to be easy  It's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication, and it's going to be the toughest task for me to try to get this team back to The Finals. I've had to step up my leadership  I had to be very patient, which I'm not very patient  I'm not a very patient guy, but I knew I had to work on that. To be able to sit at one point during the season and see us at 19‑20 and watching my team struggle and me sitting out two weeks, they wanted Coach Blatt fired, saying we needed another point guard, will LeBron and Kyrie be able to play together?Â  So many story lines was just happening at that point in time  For us to be sitting at this point today being able to represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals, this is special  It's very special."
2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you yourself, I think, had said last summer that you kind of tried to lower expectations and you couldn't expect a ton in year one, and obviously there were a lot of changes, too  This was basically a brand new team on opening night  Did you think you could do this this quickly?Â  And where does this accomplishment rank among‑‑ I mean, it's five straight Finals, obviously, but where does this one rank in relation to the rest?","Obviously, from the time I decided to come back to now, it's a totally different team  When I decided to come back, we had a No.1 pick, and we drafted Andrew Wiggins  I understood that we were going to have a very, very young team, a very unexperienced team, and it's going to take a lot of patience and a lot of hard work to get to where I wanted to get this team back to. Obviously, things happened throughout the season, throughout the off‑season, that allowed us to acquire Kevin Love, and as the season started, to acquire J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov and Iman Shumpert that brought our team to a place where I felt that we could compete. But I still thought we had to be very patient, I had to be very patient, being the leader of the team, but I knew we had the pieces that we can compete. Where this ranks as far as my last four Finals appearances, I mean, it's special just because I think it's today, it's tonight, and to know how far we've come as a group, to know how unexperienced we are as a unit playing together, I think that's special in its own right  No matter what happens from here on out, to see what we've accomplished being a first‑year team together that's had different changes throughout the course of the season, that's faced so many obstacles throughout the season‑‑ injuries here, transactions here, lineups here‑‑ it's something we can be very proud of to this point."
2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, when you made the decision to come back, how much did that 51‑year departure from a championship come to mind?Â  Do you think about that much?Â  Perhaps being a guy that finally can end that in this city.","I'm a guy who believes in unfinished business, and I understood what these people were going through, the people here not only in Cleveland but in Northeast Ohio and all over the world who love and bleed wine and gold. I also knew there were a couple of guys here that were very special, in Tristan Thompson here to my left and also in Kyrie Irving at the time, that could help me get to a point where I've been before. So to be at this point tonight sitting up here talking to you guys, like I said, it's very emotional and very‑‑ just something‑‑ I don't know  Could I foresee this?Â  At the beginning of the season, I couldn't  I couldn't foresee us being in The Finals at the beginning of the season because I just knew that we just had to get better and I just saw how young we were and how young‑minded we were at that point in time, but I knew I had to lead these guys, and if they just followed my leadership, I knew I could get them to a place where they haven't been before."
2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,What do you have to say about what the city's been through?,"It's a hard‑working city, and if you work hard for this city, they work hard for you  They give everything back to you  That's what J.R. Smith to my right, Tristan here to my left, and the rest of the 12 guys in the locker room, we're just trying to work hard for the city, and they give it all back to us, as you saw tonight with 20,000‑plus fans."
2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, how did the journey of the season prep you to get here?Â  As you mentioned, if you guys didn't lose games early, maybe you don't make radical trades  If you guys don't have injuries throughout the course of the season, maybe you don't realize the potential of all the guys on your roster  What about the path to where you are?Â  How has that steeled you for these Finals?","I don't know how many chapters we have in the book as far as this season, but there's at least five  Just from the start of the season to us making the transaction to acquire this guy to my right and then Shump and then Timofey, to us having injuries, to us getting to the postseason, to Kevin Love being out for the postseason, to Kyrie getting banged up and being out for playoff games‑‑ we have so many different chapters to this season that's defined who we are. But one thing we haven't got caught up in is feeling sorry for ourselves  It doesn't matter  If someone is out, the next man up  If someone is not 100 percent, then as a brother, you pick that guy up  That's what it's about  That's what it's about  That's what teamwork and trying to accomplish a dream is all about, being able to sacrifice yourself and what you can do for the better of the team  That's what's got us to this point. Don't ask me another question until you ask one of these guys a question too, by the way. J.R. SMITH:Â  I'm out  I'm done. LeBRON JAMES:Â  Don't say, hey, LeBron, I'm from channel‑‑ don't ask me a question  Ask these guys  Give me a break. J.R. SMITH:Â  I could have stayed in the back. LeBRON JAMES:Â  But you look good  You fit. J.R. SMITH:Â  I've never worn one of these before."
2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"This isn't for you, LeBron.",I was just looking in the right direction.
2015-05-26,29:10,23.0,0.5,9.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, from now until when The Finals start, the championship drought, it's going to come up again and again  It's such a weighty issue here in Cleveland, of course, 50 years  When you wrote the letter, of course, you kind of tried to connect back to the people here, and your Nike commercial connected you to everybody  Now that you're here, do you embrace kind of that 50‑year drought?Â  Do you use that to fuel what you guys all need to do or do you have to separate yourself from that pressure to be able to win?","For myself, I think we all here know how long it's been since a champion has been in this city  I mean, you can try and not focus on it  You can try to say, okay, well, it's not about that  But we all know it. The one thing that we can guarantee as a team, as a group, 15 guys, our coaching staff, people that travel with us on the road, whatever the case may be, that work every day, is we will give our best shot  No matter who comes out of the Western Conference, either Golden State or Houston, we're going to give it our best shot  Our coaching staff will prepare us the best way they can, and I will as a leader have our guys ready for it. Win, lose, or draw, because you can't predict the future, you don't know what's going to happen, we will give our best shot  That's all from myself  That's all I can ask of my teammates  That's all I can ask of the coaches  And I hope everyone here understands that it's not easy  It's not easy to even get to this point  It's so hard just to win an NBA game, and the fact that we've won three playoff series so far, it is very, very difficult, and if you've never been in this situation, you don't know how difficult it is  The only people who can talk about it‑‑ one of my best quotes or favorite quotes of all time is Theodore Roosevelt  It's called the Man in the Arena  I suggest everyone read it. It's basically about, if you've never sweat or bled or been in an arena and having the dust go up in your face and never battled, you have no idea what it takes to be in the arena  So for me as a leader, all I can do is lead these guys, which I will do  The coaching staff will give us the greatest game plan they can to win against Houston, to win against Golden State, but as far as guarantees, I cannot guarantee anyone  I can't guarantee the championship  That's not what I'm here for  I'm here to lead  But I will guarantee that we will play our asses off  We will, from the first minute to minute 48, or if it's overtime, 53  We will do that. At the end of the day, that's all I can ask for  That's all we can give  But we will be in The Finals, I can guarantee that  Appreciate it. J.R. SMITH:Â  By the way, that Nike commercial, I wasn't in it  They can add me in or something. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, I wanted to ask you about your mindset on the final possession in regulation?Â  You obviously made jumpers throughout the game, but you had great success getting in the paint  I was just wondering if you were anticipating a double coming, and you might have to give up the ball and not be able to take the last shot yourself?Â  Is that why you shot a jumper?","No, my mindset was we're either going to go out of here with a win or going into overtime  I'm going to get the last shot  Actually, Shumpert was able to get another look at it, but I got to where I wanted to get, step back, made them before  We had our chances."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,"In the overtime, what happened in the overtime?Â  You got just two points?","I mean, you just said it  We couldn't get a good look  We couldn't get nothing to drop, including myself  J.R. had a really good look on the three at one point, but they just ramped it up a little bit  They got to the free‑throw line, and we didn't get it  I mean, we really only had zero points, and I got the lay‑up at the end, but that didn't mean much because they did a good job closing it in overtime."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Last time you guys lost in the playoffs was in Chicago Game 3, reeled off seven wins since then  Do you think you guys learned anything from that experience, and can you lean on it in this situation?","Well, I mean, we had a lot of miscues tonight  I think they would say the same  We had a lot of breakdowns, a couple of transition threes they made that we kind of pinpointed on saying we don't want to give those up  But at the end of the day, we gave ourselves a chance, man  I missed a tough one  But we had so many opportunities to win this game, and we didn't  It's up to us now to look at the film, watch and make some adjustments, what you need to do and be ready for Sunday."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Up until that final minute, Kyrie had had such a good game  How tough was it to see him go down, and how concerned are you about him?","It was very tough to see  I just see how hard he worked these last eight days just to get himself to play at this level tonight  Seeing him walk out of the locker room on crutches just now, that's a tough blow for our team."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Adding to that, LeBron, if Kyrie is limited at all and he can't do what you need him to do, the bench numbers were so lopsided, do you have enough you can find without him?","Well, I mean, it's the next man up  If Kyrie can't go, Delly's number is going to be called and everyone else has to pick each other up  They outscored us 35‑9 on bench points  But, you know, we still had a chance to win  We had a few miscues defensively  Had a couple of turnovers offensively, but we were right there  Like I said, they just made a couple more plays than we made."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Coach Blatt said that you had a great performance, obviously, 44 points  But the guys around you are going to need to be better  Your thoughts on how your teammate played tonight?","We all have to be better, including myself  I don't think I was great  I've got to do better things out on the floor to help us be more precise offensively  I've got to communicate a little bit more defensively to help our team get over the hump. It's not about me  It's not about the next guy  It's about all of us  We have to‑‑ we're going to watch the film and get better for Game 2."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,Was there a fatigue factor towards the end of the fourth quarter?,What do you mean?
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,Were your guys getting tired?,"I mean, I think everyone was out there just playing through it, just trying to fight through it  Both teams have been off for so many days that fatigue may have set in  But both teams were fighting and both teams wanted to win really bad."
2015-06-04,45:46,44.0,0.474,8.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0,Do you think the fact that you were in your beast mode in the last quarter sort of affected the other guys and they were expecting you to make the shots and win the game?,"Well, they expect for me to make plays  It's nothing I did tonight  It's nothing different than what I've been doing all postseason  That's just been our game plan  Guys have been able to step up and make shots and make plays  So it has nothing to do about beast mode or whatever the case  It's our game plan, and our game plan worked  We put ourselves in a position to win, we just didn't come through."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,Your bench just got nine points in Game 1 and got 21 points today  What do you think about that?,"Well, our bench was big for us tonight  We needed everything that we got from them  They came in and did an excellent job of contributing offensively and defensively  They were pretty good."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, what is the next day and a half or so going to be like for you thinking about playing an NBA Finals game back in Cleveland?","Well, it's going to be the same as it has been being out here  Round‑the‑clock treatment, get my body, get my mind ready for the game. I get an opportunity to go home  I haven't seen my wife, seen my kids in four or five days  Give them some big hugs, big kisses, and then I'm going to lock back in  So it's the same thing for me."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,What did you do after the shock of losing Game 1 and the news about Kyrie to get the team's spirits up heading into this game?,"Just letting them understand and telling them about the moment, the moment that we're in, not about the game  I think the game is such a small thing, when you think about the moment and compare it to the moment  We have a chance to be a part of history, but it's the small steps that you take to get to that point. So mentally, physically, just having those guys ready, throwing things in their ears to try to let them understand what this is all about, and they responded very well."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,Have you ever played with a guy like Matthew Dellavedova before?Â  And what was going through your mind when he was at the free‑throw line?,"No, I think he's unique in his own way  Obviously he's a guy that's been counted out his whole life  Probably people have been telling him he's too small, he's not fast enough, can't shoot it enough, can't handle it good enough, and he's beat the odds so many times. The confidence that we have in him allows him to be confident in himself  He goes out and he just plays his tail off, and when a guy like that does that, he gets great results."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,And about the free throws?,"Well, he was very calm  Before you get to the free throws, just to follow up on the missed three by J.J., usually when J.J., J.R. and Mike Miller shoot, we don't rebound, because most of the time they make them  So for us, for Delly to be able to crash in and get that and go up there and knock two free throws down, that was huge."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"Your coach said that you guys were the underdog and you were written off  You guys were written off coming into this game  How much is that a personal motivation for you and how important, how good does it feel to get a rare‑‑ to get a loss‑‑ to get a win in Golden State?","Well, I mean, I don't need any extra motivation  I think our guys love it  Our guys love the fact that we've been counted out and come into the series being an underdog  They're pretty much saying that especially after Kyrie got hurt and the series was over  I think our guys are using that as motivation  I use a little bit of it, but I have a lot of motivation already to just be a part of greatness and be a part of this and be a part of this atmosphere. My motivation is to make sure my guys are ready and prepared every night we step on the floor  And I have some other motivation that I won't talk about right now, but I have so many different things to worry about than being an underdog or guys counting us out."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, just take us through Delly's performance on Steph Curry  It's one of Steph's probably worst shooting performances in his career.","It had everything to do with Delly  He just kept a body on Steph  He made Steph work  He was spectacular, man, defensively  We needed everything from him  When Steph shoots the ball, you just automatically think it's going in because he shoots the ball so well  I mean, he stunned me on one in the fourth quarter where he just took an in‑and‑out dribble and raised for a three and he nailed it and that wasn't on Delly. He just did a great job  Just trying to make it tough on Steph  That's all you can do  You make it tough on him  You get a contest, and you live with the results, and I think Delly did that."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"You've talked about different versions of this team this year  What is the identity of the team right now, and when did you discover that maybe it could be a grittier team than you had anticipated?","Yeah, that's what it is, it's the grit squad that we have  It's not cute at all  If you're looking for us to play sexy, cute basketball, then that's not us  That's not us right now  Everything is tough  You know, we're going to come in with an aggressive mindset defensively and offensively. And for us to win a Finals game shooting 32 percent from the field, it's just a testament of how gritty we can be  It has to be that for the rest of the series, no matter how many games it takes."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"If you go back and look through just at all your games, all your performances, I don't think, especially in the playoffs, you've ever done what you've pulled off personally the last two games  There are a number of different ways you can answer this, but where is it coming from?","(Laughing)  It just comes from the work ethic  When the 20,000‑plus fans aren't there and you guys aren't there, I mean, you see it because you're probably with me every day and some of your other guys or some of our other beat writers, you guys see how much work I put into my craft every day, before, after practice. When you put that much work in there, you live with the results  For me to be able to go out on the biggest stage and to be able to make plays happen for my teammates is the ultimate feeling for myself  That's why I take my profession, I take my craft very seriously."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"You mentioned I believe yesterday, you said you could play 41, 42 minutes  You played well over that tonight and still played‑‑ you were a force each and every minute on the court. Â The next question everybody's going to ask is can this continue?Â  Are you built for this?","Well, am I built for it?Â  Well, of course I'm built for it (laughing)  I mean, it's a maximum of five games left in the NBA season  So I'm ready for whatever."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"Just piggybacking on that, two overtime games, 90‑something minutes for you  How much are you feeling it right now?Â  And did you come into tonight's game with a little bit different edge knowing you didn't have Kyrie to lean on a little?","Did you see how I walked in here?Â  I'm feeling it  I'm feeling it right now for sure  That's why I've got one of the best trainers in the world in Mike Mancias who will make sure I'm ready for Game 3  We already have started on my rehab  Already started on my session  I will get rehab on the plane  We've got a five‑hour flight back home, and we've got all‑around‑the‑clock treatment tomorrow and get ready for Game 3  I'll be ready."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,Byron Scott used to talk about the injured dog theory; that an injured dog is the most frightening dog  Do you guys feel like that's where you're at right now?,"I mean, all we can do is go out and play hard  We're undermanned  I mean, we're without two All‑Stars, and I don't know any other team in this league that would be able to do that, to be able to be without two All‑Stars on their team and compete the way we compete and be a force  So the guys are taking that very personal. For us mentally we can't allow‑‑ the one thing we can't allow is what everyone is saying about us affect what we need to do out on the floor, because that's just smoke and mirrors of what everybody else says about us or what they think is going to happen with the series  What truly matters is what we have as a game plan and how we go out and execute it  That's all that matters."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, I think you would prefer not to have to shoot 38 or 34 shots a game  What's it like for you to play this way and know that you do have to go out there and do this?","Well, the good thing about tonight, I took 34 shots, but I had my 11 assists  Once again, I was knocking on the 40 door again  So they let me score 40 again  That felt pretty‑‑ I'm happy I'm able to do that in a win  So just to go out‑‑ I'm not a high‑volume shooter  I've never been in my career  But things have changed on our team where the shots that Kevin and Kyrie would have has now been placed on myself and the rest of the guys as well. It's what needs to be done to help our team win  Am I going to be in the 30s every game or things of that nature?Â  I'm not sure  I would not like to  But if that's what the case has to be to help us win, then I don't have a choice."
2015-06-07,50:20,39.0,0.314,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,"You obviously won four of these, but this is the first Finals win in Cavaliers history  You obviously are a man of history  What's this mean to you?","It means everything  It means everything to be able to be a part of history and to get this win for this franchise, for our city, for all the Cavs fans all over the world. And if I can leave my fans with something, these fans here are pretty loud, pretty good, really good  I'm looking forward to seeing our fans and I can't wait to see our fans  I've heard our fans pretty loud before  A couple instances my first postseason appearance was really loud, and me coming home against the Knicks at the start of the season was pretty good  But I know we can be much, much louder than any fan base in this league. I know they're getting ready, and I can't wait to see them. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"During this postseason you've had multiple guys step up aside of you and play well  Tonight it was the dynamic duo of you and Dellavedova  When you look at what you guys were able to accomplish out there, was there a time on the court where you knew that you two guys had it going?","Well, I mean, I know one thing I'm going to count on Delly as always is how hard he's going to play  He's going to give everything he's got  His body, he's going to throw his body all over the place  And he's going to compete at a high level however many minutes he's out on the floor. Tonight it was 30 1/2 minutes, and for 30 1/2 minutes he gave everything he's got  It was great to have someone like that out on the floor that was willing to sacrifice everything for the better of the team."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Could you talk a little bit about your teammates accepting their roles and their defensive intensity for this game?Â  A lot of people are equating it to like the Allen Iverson, 76ers team that went to The Finals where you're handling the bulk of the scoring, but they're really locking down defensively knowing their roles and helping you out in a great way.","Well, we said it from the beginning that in order for us to win, we have to defend  My guys do a great job of coming out and defending  Everyone knows their role, and we all play our role to the best of our ability  We don't step outside our box  When you have that type of chemistry out on the floor, it makes everything work."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"The other day you didn't like the suggestion that they were letting you get 40‑plus points  Tonight Steph Curry was talking about how your 40 is not the problem, that it's just coming in with a high volume of shots  I'm just curious your reaction to that comment?","I don't have a reaction  I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to help our team win  If it's high‑volume shooting, if it's high rebounding, if it's high assists, whatever it takes to help our team win. We're out two All‑Stars, and we're out a starting center, so I have to pick up some of the shot attempts  I'm not a high‑volume guy  I don't like to shoot high‑volume shots, but it's The Finals, and it's whatever it takes. I don't have a comment for Steph  That's not my concern  What my concern is how I come out and play, be aggressive  If it's high‑volume shooting, I'm living in the paint  I'll shoot 34 shots, but I only took six threes, and one of them was a heave at the end of a shot clock  That lets me know I'm being aggressive."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"After Game 2, LeBron, you challenged the Cleveland crowd to come out here and match the intensity that you saw in Oakland in Games 1 and 2  How do you think the crowd helped out today?Â  Did it help motivate you guys?Â  Obviously you came out with big intensity.","Absolutely  They were unbelievable from the start to the finish  We fed off them, and we just tried to give it all back to them for 48 minutes  As loud as they were, they need to go home now and start soaking up a lot of tea, drinking a lot of tea for the next 36 hours, whatever the case may be, because they need to be just as loud Thursday night. So I need you guys to get those voices right  But they're going to be unbelievable Thursday night as well  Those guys, everyone, they were amazing."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,Back to what you were talking about  The efficiency is something that's one of the few ways where you'll consistently critique your own game even in a win  Did you have to go through some sort of mind shift to kind of allow yourself to be okay with playing this way or get yourself to the point of playing this way?,"I mean, I'm not okay with it  I'm not okay with it, but I'm so outside the box right now  I went seven straight seasons with improving my efficiency  Seven straight into this year, the previous seven seasons, seven straight seasons with improving my efficiency as far as shooting. But this is a different challenge  This is a totally different challenge  I've never played where two All‑Stars were out  So it's a different challenge for myself, and it's outside the box, but it's not too far  It's not far for me to go grab  I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to help  I know you guys keep hearing me elaborate on whatever it takes, but that's what I'm trying to do. I'm high‑volume shooting, but it's not like I'm going out there and I'm high‑volume shooting and I'm not doing anything else  I'm doing everything for our team to help our team win, and that's all that matters."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Steve Kerr said that it felt like his team lacked life those first three quarters  When you were out there during those first three quarters, did you get the sense that it was you guys sucking the life out of them?","No, I mean, I don't think those guys lacked life  I think they came in and we just tried to put pressure on them like we've done the first three games, the first two games and then tonight. But those guys, they got a rhythm in the fourth quarter  Part of it is because we allowed them to get into a rhythm in the start of the fourth  We had some costly turnovers as well  We let Steph shake three, but some of Steph's threes were some he made in the fourth quarter, were some of the same he missed in Game 2 or earlier in the game tonight  We had some heck of a contest, but he was just ‑‑ he let them go. But for us we've just got to continue to put the pressure on them  Try to keep them below their averages  They're going to make great shots  They're a great team, great players, great coaching staff  We'll just live with the results."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, what you guys were able to do defensively to them, in the third quarter they only had 55 points  It seemed like you kind of took the wind out of their sails a little bit  Was that satisfying for you out on the floor seeing that you're almost able to break a team?","It's not satisfying when they end the game with 91  We hold them to 55 points for three quarters and we allowed them to break off with 36  That's not satisfying at all  We've got a lot of film to watch tomorrow  We're a young group, and we have to learn from our mistakes  We had a lot of mistakes in the fourth quarter  I think everybody's going to remember the turnovers we had late  But it started from the beginning  We have to learn from those things. We're a young group, and like I told the guys, it's okay  It's okay  We haven't been in a lot of these situations, if any, with this group. But the best teacher in life is experience  We experienced it tonight  We're going to watch a lot of film tomorrow on ways we can get better, close out games the best way, and we'll be ready for Game 4."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Can you please elaborate on your working relationship with Coach Blatt?Â  Earlier this evening he said that he's not always know what you're going to do, but he's certain that you will do the right thing  So can you please give us your side of this relationship?","I think our relationship continues to grow every day  To have a guy like that who has been around the game of basketball for so many years, he wants the best out of his team  He wants the best for himself as well and his coaching staff and to be able to be the leader of the team  I just try to give it all back to him. My mind is always working throughout the game  Sometimes I'm able to say it verbally, sometimes I'm just thinking the game and hoping the coaching staff and players and the guys and Coach Blatt know whatever I'm doing, it's for the best of the team  And he's allowing me to do that, and I respect that a lot."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"Given all the adversity that you guys have faced here in the postseason, when you see Shump go down, leave the game and then come back and play with what nearly looks like one arm, what's that show you?","We just can't afford any more injuries  We just can't, especially from a guard perspective  I just thought about his shoulder  As soon as it happened, I knew exactly which shoulder it was, and I was just hoping for the best  When he came back on the floor with his shoulder wrapped and knowing that he wasn't at a hundred percent, which is his body out there, and still competing, it means everything to the team  It means everything to me  It means everything to him as well  As you can tell, he came back out there. But, yeah, we just can't afford any injuries right now  We're already depleted."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, is there a scarier opponent in the league than Steph when he gets going like that, especially at the end of a game?Â  And, two, is there any concern going forward that he's found his rhythm and he's kind of found his shooting stroke a little bit?","A scarier opponent in our league?Â  I mean, we have some very great basketball players in our league, and Steph happens to be one of them  His ability to shoot the ball is probably‑‑ I've never seen someone that can shoot the ball off the dribble like himself, ever  So he's always keeping you off balance  Every game is different  He caught a rhythm in the fourth quarter tonight and hit some big shots. But for us we just try to continue to make it tough on him  He's a great player  He's a league MVP, and that's all you can ask  Our defense, we held this great team to 40 percent shooting  It's not just about one guy  Even though he's going to get it going, we've just got to make sure we do a good number on the rest of those guys."
2015-06-09,46:00,40.0,0.412,12.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,"In regard to that team defense, how much does it help during the playoffs that you've been able to dig into an opponent's tendencies in a series compared to the regular season where it's one game on to the next opponent?","Well, the regular season can never compare to a playoff game  Just because we play so many games throughout the regular season, and you're going from city to city, players to players, different systems to different systems  You don't have much time to really get into the books and get into the tendencies and things of that nature. In the postseason you're able to kind of not get a rhythm, but know what's going to go on  Because once the playoffs start, not many teams are going to change  You've worked so many months to work a system that that's what you're going to see. For us, for our coaching staff to be able to put us in a position where we feel like this is best for us to win, as the players, we just try to go out and execute it the best way we can by playing hard, competing, making them take tough shots and also attacking them on the other end. The playoffs is definitely a great way to just lock in on a certain team and not worrying about having to fly out and be in another city here or be in another city there or see another opponent the next night.

2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"You've talked all series about being undermanned and overmatched  So tonight Golden State comes out  They make an adjustment with their starting lineup  They feel like they've changed the pace  Are you, as a team, in a position where you can make an adjustment, or are you confined to just go with what you have?","We don't have many options as far as lineups we can go to, but we can make adjustments  That's what you do throughout a series  We'll get to the film and make the necessary adjustments coming into Game 5  But as far as lineup changes, we don't have many different lineup changes we can actually go to."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"When you went down and hit your head, one, how are you feeling now?Â  Two, did you think that you'd have to go through any sort of concussion test or anything like that at the time?","I was just trying to regain my composure, and I was holding my head  It was hurting  I was just hoping I wasn't bleeding  But obviously the camera cut me pretty bad  Our medical staff did a great job of stopping the bleeding. I knew I had to shoot the free throws or I wasn't going to be able to come back into the game, so it didn't matter what was going on with my head at that point in time  I had to go up there and shoot those free throws so I could continue to play."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"LeBron, you mentioned you guys don't have a lot of lineups you can go to right now  But when a guy like J.R. Smith is struggling how he is, how difficult‑‑ how much pressure does that put on everybody else?Â  And what can you do or what can you say to try to help him through this?","I don't put too much pressure on anyone else  You continue to stick with them  We all struggle at times  We all have a couple games here, a couple games there we won't play so well  We know we can help the team, but just not falling for us. But you don't give up on anyone  We all got to this point together, and you stick with them  He's been huge for our team all year  We wouldn't be at this point without him  So hopefully he can get it going, which we believe."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"In the fourth quarter after you guys had cut that 12‑point halftime deficit down to six, you're out of the game for the first couple minutes and they put you back to double digits  What goes through your mind there?Â  Do you feel like you can't even come out of the game?","Oh, well, I was hoping our team could buy me a few minutes  I ran through those 12 minutes in the third, and I gassed out  Just tried to put us in a position‑‑ Steph hit a big‑time three at the end of the third, put them up six, I missed one, but I was pretty much gassed either from driving, creating opportunities for my teammates, getting to the free‑throw line, getting offensive glass, just trying to make that push. And I was hoping our team could just buy me a couple minutes  We weren't able to do that tonight in the fourth quarter, and, I mean, it's difficult  You want to be out there, but also you don't want to be‑‑ you want to be effective while you're out there too  So they made a huge run, and we just couldn't regather after that."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"Just to follow up on that, the coach talked about how he felt maybe the schedule was really starting to fatigue the side  Can you talk to that?Â  And also I've got to ask you specifically about the man earlier in the week, Delly, do you think his hospital visit had an impact on his performance tonight?","No, I mean, no excuses  The schedule is what it is  We knew that coming into the series  We knew it was going to be every other day when we got home, and those guys were going to have two days in between when they went home  But I think defensively we were still very good  Offensively we were terrible  You can't always‑‑ you can't always bank on your offense  Sometimes your offense just doesn't show up, and there is no way we go 4‑for‑27 from the three‑point line and expect to win. We outrebounded them still  We had 16 offensive rebounds  We had 20 second‑chance points  But we just couldn't get the long ball going tonight, and that definitely hurt‑‑ our offense hurt us just as bad as anything. As far as Delly, I think Delly said he felt great  We thought he was great  He just didn't make shots, and that's what happens sometimes."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"LeBron, they talk about you getting stitches or anything like that?Â  Is that a possibility?Â  Two, do you think you guys are going to have to go deeper on the bench and play more guys just to‑‑ you guys kind of looked like your legs were heavy tonight.","Well, I already got the stitches  Obviously, you can't see them  That's the coach's decision if he decides he wants to go deeper in the bench  We haven't played many guys throughout this playoff run  I think it would help some of the guys that are playing some high minutes for sure  Just give guys a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there  But I think the coaching staff will try to do what's best to help us be physically and mentally prepared for Sunday."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,How many stitches?,Enough to close it up.
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,Steve Kerr said Iguodala has been his best player in this series  This was the first game he started all season long  What did you think his impact was tonight?,"He's one of the X‑factors, and he came to play  He shot the ball extremely well  He hit four threes  He was in attack  He got a couple dunks in transition early on in the game which got him going, and he was really good for them. Coach Kerr did a great job of mixing the lineup up  They have so many different interchangeable players where he can kind of decide how he wants to go with his lineups in that nature, and to start him tonight gave them that boost."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"Did you feel like they did anything differently defensively against you or was it mostly straight up still, or did they shade guys toward you as you got in the lane?","No, they doubled me a little bit more tonight  They kind of made me get a ball up, seeing if some of my teammates can beat those guys. Like I said, we couldn't make any shots from the outside, but we'll take those looks again  Those guys, my guys did a great job just stepping into them, trying to make them being confident about them  But when you go 4‑for‑27 from the three‑point line, there's not much success offensively."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"They talked a lot about trying to increase the pace the past few days  Do you think there was anything they were effective in doing that or, again, is that a product of you guys not making shots and allowing them to get out?","Yeah, their pace has been pretty good all series  It's just that we've made shots and we've made them take the ball out of the basket instead of getting it off a rebound  Tonight we shot 33 percent from the field  So when you're getting the ball off the glass or you're getting the ball off the rim, your pace is much better than when you're taking the ball off the net  So it's just a product of us not shooting the ball well at all."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"J.R. Smith has really been struggling throughout this whole series  Today, 0‑from‑8 from the three‑point line  Do you think maybe bringing him back to the starting five will be the right step to build up his confidence?","That's a decision I think Coach Blatt and the coaching staff will either make or not make  He's been great for us coming off the bench  He's been great for us starting  So we'll see  We'll see what the coaches have him playing  We're going to go with him, we'll continue to give him the ball  He's a spark for our team, whether he's in the starting role or not."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,Your fans started to leave the arena five minutes before the game was over  Your comment about that?,"I don't have any comment about it  I mean, I came out of the game as well early  So we were on the same page."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,At the start of the game they took out Andrew Bogut and went with Iguodala in the starting lineup  What kind of challenges does their small ball lineup present to you guys?,"Well, obviously, you're going to have a lot of guys on the perimeter  When your big is accustomed to guarding a big for three straight games and there is a change, now our big, meaning Timo, has to make a change  He has to guard a smaller guy, which he's not been accustomed to ever  So he definitely gave us a little different look defensively to start the game. We still started the game pretty well  We were up 7‑0, but Steph making the three, Iguodala hits the three, Harrison Barnes makes one, Draymond hits one  And they offensively got it going  They got in a rhythm, and you could start seeing it. It's something like I said, while it's going on, you kind of like:Â  What do we do here?Â  What do we do there?Â  And that's what the days in between games are for  You're able to look at the film and go from there and see ways you can just be better."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,Three games left  How are you going to be able to overcome the utter physical and mental exhaustion that you're feeling?,"I mean, it's three games left possibly  You just go out and play  You know you go out, you play hard. Coaching staff gives you a great game plan, you go out and execute it and live with the results at the end of the day. That's all you can ask  It's the biggest stage in the world, but I don't put too much added pressure on myself about basketball  It's just‑‑ that's all it is  It's just basketball."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"Two questions  One, did you have to go through any concussion protocol things?Â  Was there any thought that you might have something like that?Â  And the second one would be you guys are two games away from winning a title  Just living here, feeling that in the city of Cleveland, what's that been like for you the last couple of days?","No, I didn't have to go through any concussion protocol  I had a slight headache, which I think every last one of you guys would probably have if you ran into a camera  You might have a little bit more than that  But I didn't go through any protocol  I'm fine  Like I said, I got a few stitches and I got a little slight headache right now, but I'll be fine with that. I don't know if I get the feeling or not, because I don't really get involved in it, the whole thing  I understand how important this city is and what I mean to this city and what our team means to the city as far as even with other professional sports teams that we have in this city, but I don't get caught up into it  I just go out and play my game  I try to lead the best way I can, and if I can put my team and this franchise in a position to win the title, I'm grateful for that, and that's what I'm trying to do."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"Draymond Green was just in here and he said this Finals has been a street fight  So to use a boxing analogy, you guys are moving into the championship rounds  You have a lot of Finals experience; a lot of your teammates do not  As a leader, how do you keep their confidence up for these last three games for this fight?","Well, I mean, if I told my teammates six months ago or whatever the case may be that it would be 2‑2 and we had an opportunity to be 2‑2 in The Finals going on the road, would you take it?Â  With three games left, I think all of them would accept that, and that's what it's about. I mean, this is the biggest stage  It's being covered by everyone in the world, and you should just be happy to go out and just compete  Win, lose or draw, you go out and compete  And that's all that should matter. It shouldn't matter what everyone is talking about or what everyone is putting pressure on you or things of that nature  It means nothing  I mean, in the scheme of things  You go out and you play, and you've been playing basketball your whole life  You live with the results after that."
2015-06-11,40:55,20.0,0.318,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,The series is tied now going to Golden State  Do you feel that this is the biggest challenge of your career so far?Â  How do you feel about maybe thinking about letting this one go at home?,"You don't let any of them go  Both teams are in The Finals for a reason  You can either look at it, okay, we stole home court and they stole it back  Or you could look at it and say they won two on their floor; we won two on our floor  It would be the same thing  If they won Game 1 and Game 2 and we came home and protected home court, it would be 2‑2 and we're heading to Game 5. So the story line is different  It just depends on what day it is and how you guys want to write the story. Biggest challenge of my career was being down 3‑2 going into Boston  That's probably the biggest challenge of my career  Game 5 at Golden State is not that big when it comes to going to Boston and you lose multiple times in that arena, and the franchise that I was with at the time had never won a playoff game in Boston  Now that's pretty challenging  So I've been through a little bit in my pretty cool career.

He took some great shots  Some of them was in a rhythm, and some of them‑‑ after he hit a few, he loves to go to the heat check, and we're all okay with that, and he just missed them."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"LeBron and Tristan, LeBron, you gave, I would say, everything you had there, 40, 14, and 11, and you still come up short  For both of you, how do you cope with that, when you have games like that that you guys usually win?","Well, you cope with it by understanding it's just one game and looking at the opportunity we have on Tuesday to force a Game 7  Obviously, for myself, I want to do whatever it takes to help our team win, and I haven't been able to do that the last two. So hopefully I can do a better job coming in on Tuesday  We all as a unit can do a better job, and we'll be fine. TRISTAN THOMPSON:Â  Piggyback on what LeBron said, just watch film and figure out areas we can do better at  For me, rebound a little better, guard my man a little better, and just don't have mental breakdowns. But like he said, we've got to go home and get a win and force a Game 7."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"Obviously, like you just said, you guys will be on the cusp of elimination on Tuesday  But obviously you don't want the Warriors celebrating on your home floor  So how do you rally your teammates, and what will be your message to them before Game 6?","Well, we don't want them celebrating at all, no matter if it's on our home floor or their home floor  We've come this far, and we've been very good at home  We have to understand why we weren't good in Game 4  We had a lack of energy  We had a lack of effort in a lot of areas in Game 4, and we can't repeat that or they'll raise the trophy for sure."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"The fourth quarter has gone their way pretty well the last two games  Is it fatigue, the depth thing, or is it just execution problems?Â  What's going on in those last couple nights?","I think tonight, obviously, Steph got it going  He hit some huge shots which kept us at bay  They got a couple of offensive rebounds that didn't work to our favor  You know, we needed our best defensive quarter tonight in the fourth quarter, and we didn't get it  We gave up 31 points in the fourth  Some of them were free throws, but a lot of them were them just breaking us down  So we've got to do a better job of that."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"You said hopefully you can do a little more the next game out  How much more can you possibly do given what you've been putting in in this series, and do you ever recall having to extend yourself this far in a series?","I don't know  I don't put a ceiling on what I can do  I don't know  I mean, tonight I gave up two offensive rebounds‑‑ one to Barbosa in the first half, one to Harrison Barnes, which allowed him to get an and‑one with Iguodala with the left‑hand trick shot. I had a couple turnovers, a couple miscues defensively, and I've got to be better  I don't know  Like I said, I don't put a ceiling on what I'm capable of doing  I know I'm shouldering a lot of the burden, but it is what it is."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,You seem to be playing a lot more comfortable this Finals series  There was a play I think you had a behind‑the‑back lay‑up where you went up and you're making crazy threes  Do you feel a lot less pressure this Finals run just because you are undermanned and you had some injuries as opposed to previous years?,"No  No, I feel confident because I'm the best player in the world  It's that simple."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"In regards to pressure with the games playing, do you feel as if this Finals team, it's a little less?","No, I mean, it's The Finals  It's something you dream of when you're a kid  For me, I put the work in  I put the work in every single day, either when you guys are there, either when you're not there  Some of our beat writers see me  They know how much work I put into it, and I give everything to my teammates. When you're true to the game, it doesn't matter if it's a regular season game or a Finals game, you just go out and trust what you put into the game and you live with the results  So shouldn't be crazy when I make threes, though  It's just a shot."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"In particular, the half court one, the almost half court one, that was somewhat crazy?",Okay.
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,Would you agree?,All right (laughing).
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,You mentioned giving up some offensive rebounds and the second‑chance points that they got as a team  You guys usually are doing that to other teams  Was there any sort of a deflating feeling when they were able to keep coming up with those offensive rebounds?,"When you're going up against a high‑offensive‑power team like this, to get them to miss, it's very deflating when they get a second‑chance point or a second‑chance crack  Even when they don't make it, they're looking for those three pointers, they're looking for Klay and Steph when they get offensive rebounds  So those are very deflating. But we've got to do a better job of hitting bodies, coming over the ball  They're going to get offensive rebounds because they shoot a lot of jump shots and a lot of long rebounds, but when that happens, we've got to match up very quickly and not allow them to make shots."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"LeBron, do you feel that at this moment of this series, this roster, the roster you guys have right now, do you remember like those Cavaliers X teams where you had to do it all but it wasn't enough, your previous Cavaliers teams?","Nope  Nope we're going home with a Game 6, and we've got enough to win it  We protect home we come here  We'll worry about Tuesday first  But if we protect home like we're capable of doing, we force a Game 7."
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,So this is different?,I feel confident.
2015-06-14,44:46,40.0,0.441,14.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0,"LeBron, do you feel like the smaller lineup hurt you guys defensively tonight?Â  The Golden State Warriors shot 48 percent against you guys?","Well, there are a lot of things that hurt us tonight  Steph being one of them  That had nothing to do with going small  I think we were much more active tonight than we were in Game 4. And some of the shots that they made, like I said, some of the shots that Steph made, you've got to tip your hat to a guy like that  I mean, he's between, behind, crossover, stepback threes, with a contest, you're okay with that  That had nothing to do with us being small. When we don't get back in transition, those are things we can clean up  When we get offensive rebounds on free throws, those are things we can clean up  Those are things that can hurt you  But it had nothing to do with us being small  Whoever's in the game needs to do their job and do it at a high level, do it to the best of their ability and you live with the aftermath after that.

2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, you guys stated throughout these playoffs next man up, no excuses  But now that it's over, how devastating of a blow was it to lose Kevin early in the playoffs, and then Kyrie in these Finals?","Well, I think you even go before that, losing Andy, one of our heartbeats of our team, another playmaker for our team  Then you lose Kev, an All‑Star, and then you lose Kyrie, another All‑Star. Tried as much as we could to try to make up for those guys, but it's a lot of talent sitting in suits  I've had a lot of playoff runs, been on both ends, and I know one thing that you've got to have during the playoff run, you've got to be healthy  You've got to be healthy  You've got to be playing great at the right time  You've got to have a little luck  And we were playing great, but we had no luck and we weren't healthy."

2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, I know, obviously, you have reason to be frustrated  Sitting at the locker like you were just really dejected  Can you talk about how this feeling feels compared to other times where you probably might have been bounced off the playoffs and just your emotion and dealing with that?","There's not much you can say really  I mean, you get to this point, and I've been on the short end of this four times, and I've been able to win it twice  It's really no great feeling when you lose. Only thing you can do is just try to pick yourself back up whenever that time may be and then just go at it again  I'm a guy who is just trying to be successful in whatever I do, and I give everything to my teammates, give everything to the coaching staff. When you fall short, it hurts and it eats at you, and it hurts me to know that I wish I could have done better and done more and just put a little bit more effort or whatever the case may be to help us get over the hump  But it just wasn't our time."
2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"When you lose on a stage like this, how fast do you begin thinking about next season?",I haven't thought about next season at all.
2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, with all the things you're talking about, Kyrie, Kevin, that you were dealing with, was there ever a point in this Finals that you doubted whether you'd be able to pull this off?","Yeah, when the numbers went to zero and we lost tonight  That's when I doubted  That's when it was over  I mean, obviously, I knew it was going to be a tough task, and I continued to tell you guys we were undermanned  I don't know any other team‑‑ I've been watching basketball for a long time  I'm an historian of the game  I don't know any other team that's gotten to The Finals without two All‑Stars  I cannot remember thinking of it  I can't remember in the back‑‑ I don't even know if it's ever happened, for a team to lose two All‑Stars and still be able to make it to The Finals. Even what Andy brings to our team as well, that's another double‑double guy  We had three playmakers in suits this round and even throughout the playoffs  You've got to have all the playmakers  You've got to be healthy  You've got to be at full strength to win it  We weren't  We just wasn't."
2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"The way you had to play in this series was so out of character for you in terms of how you like to play  Did any part of you enjoy doing that, enjoy being able to do that?Â  Or do you prefer what's more comfortable to you?","Well, I mean, I enjoy the competition  And whatever it takes throughout the competition I'm fine with  I don't enjoy being as non‑efficient as I was  I don't enjoy that  I don't enjoy dribbling the ball for countless seconds on the shot clock and the team looking at me to make a play  We had 14 assists tonight  I had nine of them  I did not enjoy that  That's not winning basketball. Like I said, we had two big‑time playmakers on the sideline  We've got another one that's been out since early in the season  And it was what I had to do. Â It was what was needed  If I could have gave more, I would have done it, but I gave everything I had."
2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"Did you at any point feel the series shift?Â  And if you felt that shift, were you concerned at the time that there wouldn't be an adjustment that the Cavs can make?","I felt‑‑ I mean, it was a great series up until‑‑ they blew the game open in the fourth in Game 5, but we had a chance there  Tonight we had our chances, but, you know, we ran out of talent  We ran out of talent tonight  We gave everything we had  The guys played as hard as they could as long as we could. But that team across the way, you tip your hats to them  I cannot remember a team like them being healthy all year for the most part  All the guys, I mean, they did a great job  Guys being healthy, guys playing their system, and it showed in these Finals."
2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, we learned a little bit more about your, I guess, training regimen throughout the course of these playoffs  Basically it's a two‑month process you go through with mental and physical preparation  When you don't get the championship, is there any sense of‑‑ do you question whether it's all worth it?Â  Or can you just have satisfaction in the process?","Well, of course you question it, especially when you get to this point  I always look at it would I rather not make the playoffs or lose in The Finals?Â  I don't know  I don't know  I've missed the playoffs twice  I lost in The Finals four times  I'm almost starting to be like I'd rather not even make the playoffs than to lose in The Finals  It would hurt a lot easier if I just didn't make the playoffs and I didn't have a shot at it. But then I lock back in and I start thinking about how fun it is to compete during the playoffs and the first round, the second round, and Eastern Conference Finals  If I'm lucky enough to get here again, it will be fun to do it. But put my body through a lot, you know, but it's the price for your body feeling this way for winning  Did I win?Â  I didn't win a championship, but I've done a lot of good things in this first year back, and hopefully I can continue it."

2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"I meant because of the comeback, the fact that you came back here and decided to make it your home again?","No, you lose in The Finals, they're all disappointing  Doesn't matter if I'm playing in Miami or playing in Cleveland or playing on Mars  You lose The Finals, it's disappointing."
2015-06-16,46:42,32.0,0.394,18.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, everybody on the Warriors agreed that defending you was the toughest job in basketball  What was your impression of what kind of job Andre Iguodala did, and what was his effect on the series?","Well, I think the last couple games he played well  He played great, especially offensively  He made us defend him  He knocked down open shots  Defensively, it's never a one‑on‑one battle  Guys get caught up in this whole one‑on‑one thing, and it's never a one‑on‑one battle  Every time I'd get past him, another guy would step up, Draymond Green or whatever the case may be. It's never one‑on‑one  It's not‑‑ this isn't Bird versus Magic or that old video game, Jordan versus Bird, or whatever the case may be  There's no one‑on‑one  But I think his ability to play multiple positions for their team along with some of those other guys allowed their team to be so dynamic. He made us pay  He made us pay tonight with big shots, timely shots, getting out on the break, getting rebounds, getting assists  He was pretty good for their team.

2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, we spent the last couple days talking about the way the Raptors like to shrink the floor and clog and take away the paint.  Tonight they seemed to do the exact opposite.  Is that a sign that you are forcing teams to get out of their comfort zone and do things they're not accustomed to doing? Le","I think for us, it's never -- our game plan is never dictated.  I think for us, we want to push the tempo.  We want to move the ball from side to side, and we want to attack.  With myself and Ky, we love to live in the paint.  We love to attack, and then when the defense collapses, we're going to spread out to our shooters.  Tonight they wanted us to be in the paint, and we just tried to take advantage of that.  We had 56 points in the paint, and everyone was still in a great rhythm. I think probably the least amount of threes that we've shot and made probably in the postseason so far, but as I keep telling you guys every single day, we're not a jump-shooting team.  You guys kept looking at me crazy about it.  We're not a jump-shooting team.  We're a balanced team, and whatever the game dictates, we're able to adjust to that."
2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you guys knew that they would try something different.  They didn't want to give up that three ball.  But were you surprised a little bit that the single coverage they had -- looked like there was no help once you got past your defender early on. Did that surprise you at all to that extent? Le","I don't predetermined what is going on or how they're going to defend me.  I read and react.  They played me straight up in the post.  I just tried to make quick, solid moves to get into the paint.  If they brought help, I was still going to be able to find my guys. You know, whatever the defense is doing in that possession, I'm able to read and react and know what's going on.  I've seen every coverage, so definitely we have to be better in Game 2 because we know they're going to have some changes, and that's what the series is about, being able to adjust from game to game, and they're going to make adjustments, and we have to be ready for whatever."
2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"You guys came in and we talked all week long about not being rusty.  Dwane Casey mentioned that the Raptors seemed to be a step slower than you guys.  How much did the nine days' rest really help you guys, and how much did you feel that the extra step and that you wouldn't be rusty coming out tonight in Game 1? Le","Well, we didn't rest.  We just didn't have a game.  We didn't rest.  Coach Lue gave us one day off.  Other than that, we was in the gym working, keeping our rhythm, keeping our legs ready for whenever the game was -- whenever we was going to play, so we didn't rest.  We just didn't do -- we didn't have a game in front of cameras. Our whole mindset was whenever our game was going to present itself, we was going to be ready to play our game and do it the same way we've been doing that all postseason, and we were able to accomplish that tonight."
2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, you like to say that there isn't anything that you haven't seen, but what's going on right now, you actually haven't, nine in a row to start a playoff series.  Is there any point where you begin to get concerned about just some waning focus?  When the wins keep piling up, at some point you might be challenged and caught off guard by that? Le","I don't think we have complacency in our minds right now.  We have a goal, and our goal was not nine wins.  It's just not my focus.  I've won nine games in the postseason before, won 14 games in the postseason before.  It's not my goal, and as the leader of this team, I'm going to continue to make sure that these guys understand what our goal is and they know.  They know what our goal is, and tonight was just another step in the direction that we want to head into. And we will face some adversity.  We will.  And we have to be able to handle that, which I think we'll be ready for."
2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, there was a moment middle of the second quarter where you chased down a rebound, blew past Carroll on the baseline, you slammed it hard, and then you had a reaction that was pretty memorable.  Can you talk about why you enjoyed that moment so much? Le","Just having the opportunity to play the game that I love in front of some unbelievable fans and unbelievable teammates.  When you make plays like that, you know, it's the passion that came through.  It was the excitement that my teammates was getting, looking over at the bench, the other four guys on the floor and the 20,000-plus fans that was cheering it on at that point in time, so that's where it came from.  You don't know when it's going to happen.  Sometimes it just happens.  So yep."
2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"Considering what Kyrie went through last year in The Finals, is this exactly the Kyrie you thought you would see in these playoffs? Le","Well, I think no gas, the Kyrie that I see on a daily basis when you guys are not around is the Kyrie that I envisioned.  He's grown every single day, every single week, month, and over the course of these last two years or year-plus, becoming a leader and becoming a staple of our team.  We all knew how talented the kid was and how talented he is still today, but his growth and what he demands out of all of us, you know, as the point guard, as one of the leaders of the team.  That's what's the best part about it.  I mean, you roll out a ball any single day of the week, and he'll play.  When you're that age, you can play as long as you want to anyways, but his growth, his mentality, and it's what's great about him right now."
2016-05-17,28:18,24.0,0.846,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,"The lineup that you used to start the second quarter, not one that you used a lot during the regular season.  How has that lineup been able to come together so well in such a short time, and can you sense the growing confidence with that group? Le","Well, the game ball definitely goes to our bench tonight.  I mean, you look at plus-24, 20, 18, 17, all the way down, those guys gave us a boost in that second quarter, and I was out there with them.  But Channing, Shump, Delly and R.J., at that moment they pushed the tempo. You just got to work at it.  In practices we do a lot of work together, but we've got some very smart, cerebral players.  Coach Lue is able to mix and match some lineups that he feels best fits, and that's one of the lineups that's been working pretty good for us throughout this postseason that we did not -- like you said, did not use in the regular season.  So we've got to continue to work our habits.  It's not going to always be as great as it was tonight in the second quarter, where we outscored them 33-16, but we've got to continue to work at it and continue to see ways we can help each other, and if we do that, we'll be fine.

Le","I've seen everything.  I've seen a lot, and the best thing about it, my teammates have read and react, and either given me space or given me outlets for me to make a pass to them.  Tonight was another example of that."
2016-05-19,33:45,23.0,0.538,11.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"The biggest point is we've talked so much about how well the two guys with you have been playing in this postseason, but their level of play, does it make it more difficult to deal with you then?  Does it give you more room to do different things when they're playing as well as they are? Le","Well, I mean, it's always difficult to deal with me.  I think it adds even more when you have two All-Stars with you, two guys that command multiple eyes any possession.  They're so in such a great rhythm right now, I've been able to just pick my spots and do other things to help us try to win ballgames while those guys take the load.  Tonight was an example of them giving me a little bit more space, and I just tried to make some plays."

That's a lot of time over the course of those games.  Does it feel like a streak because of the nature of the time that's been passed, and if it's not a streak, then what does it take to really sustain that level because of the length in between series? Le","I don't think it feels like a streak.  I think it feels like we won one game.  We won the next game, and how do we prepare and be better the following game.  We've taken one step at a time.  We haven't overlooked any steps along this process thus far, and I think that's part of the reason we're in this position today.  We have to be much better, obviously, in Game 3, going into a very hostile environment, going in there where they're extremely loud.  They play well, they play faster.  But we've enjoyed the process to this point, and once we got to it, we've tried to take care of business, and then once it's over, we want to learn from that instance and move on and see how we can get better the next time."

I remember there was one game where the guys sitting next to you were both injured.  In terms of how your body feels and your energy levels, is this the best you've felt at this stage of a postseason during this six-year run you've had, and what do you attribute it to? Le","Well, it's hard to say.  Obviously last year there were no excuses even with these two guys out, and for me personally and the rest of the guys, we gave it everything that we had.  So I didn't feel sorry for myself, didn't feel sorry for any of my teammates.  We didn't feel sorry for nothing because we gave everything that we had. As far as my body, I've been telling guys all year, this is the best I've felt in a while, and I've been able to do things outside of the game that kind of help me, and then when I get to the game, obviously you have two guys like this to help you.  It takes a lot of everything off of you when you have two All-Stars that can do great things."
2016-05-19,33:45,23.0,0.538,11.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"You do seem to be playing at a different gear sometimes than everybody else on the floor.  You look so fresh, and I'm wondering if the things that you did during the break, as you put it, I'm not resting during the break, what effect are you seeing of the work you put in during the break to the kind of energy that you have in these games? Le","Well, I think it's a collective workload that we all put on each other throughout the break.  Like I said, Coach Lue gave us one day off, and that was the game after the Sunday game in Atlanta.  I believe we got Monday off, and from that point on, we all worked together just to mentally prepare our bodies, physically prepare our bodies, waiting around to see who we were going to face in the next round, but we just stayed on top of each other, trying to understand, and how can we learn from the Detroit series when we swept to the next round. We've all put in our individual work.  When we're not at our practice facility, and then when we all get together, we just combine it all and just try to make the most of it."
2016-05-19,33:45,23.0,0.538,11.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"You have great respect for a lot of the legends that have come before you.  What did it mean tonight to pass Shaq on the all-time scoring list for the postseason, and also, you ran into Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  I was wondering how that talk with Kareem went. Le","Well, first of all, for me being in a position where -- it just always takes me back to my childhood and watching so many of the greats playing basketball and saying I wish I could be a part of that or at times saying there's no way I could be a part of such a great league, there's no way.  Just the statistics don't look right for me as an African-American kid growing up in the inner city.  I played both sides of the fence as a kid growing up. To be in this position today where I see my name linked to a lot of the greats that have played this game and paved the way for myself and Kyrie and Kev, it means a lot.  It's very humbling.  It's an opportunity for my family to be proud, for my fans to be proud, so that's just a lot of respect with that. I was actually, to your second question, jogging into the locker room like we usually do off the floor, and obviously I saw a legend outside of our locker room, and I slowed my pace up drastically just to embrace a legend being in our building, watching us play.  What he did for the game, the championship runs that he had with the ""Showtime"" Lakers and him being the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and so on and so on and so on, it's just respect.  When you see a guy like that, when you put him in a class with like Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali and Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, those guys all laying that same thing, Bill Russell.  It was a pretty cool moment."

Number one, are your passports up to date, and number two, what are you expecting from the Canadian fans? Le",We're good.  We've got Tristan on our team.  (Laughter).

2016-05-19,33:45,23.0,0.538,11.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, what has Ty Lue done best and what has he meant to this team? Le","I think it's just the even-keel mentality that he has.  He's always preaching next play.  Just always next play.  We come to a timeout, no matter what's going on in the game, he just continues to breed confidence and talk confidence to us, the unit that's on the floor, the unit that's off the floor.  Just a sense of calmness.  The game is so fast.  The possessions come so fast.  There are a lot of things going on in between the game, and when you come to a timeout or whatever before the game or at halftime, there's just a sense of calmness.  T-Lue has been great for us as the captain of this ship, and us as the soldiers or whatever you want to tell us or call us on the boat, we're just trying to follow his lead and execute it the right way."
2016-05-21,38:50,24.0,0.529,8.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, after Game 1, you were talking and you said that at some point, adversity would come up and you thought you guys would be ready to handle it.  Losing a game in the playoffs, does that rise to the level of adversity? Le","Well, first of all, I give a lot of credit to Toronto.  They played an exceptional game tonight.  We didn't play our game, and they made us pay for it.  I mean, it is a little adversity.  Why not?  It's the postseason, and you lose a game.  This is our first loss of the postseason.  I would count it as a little adversity. We've got to go back to the drawing board, not fix everything, just fix a few things, and be much better on Monday.  Obviously we weren't as great as we've been tonight."
2016-05-21,38:50,24.0,0.529,8.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, without having seen film, what were some of the reasons that you were not on your game tonight as a team? Le","I think early on at the start of the game we weren't as physical as we should have been, especially coming into a building that we knew we had to be a little bit more physical.  Understanding they were going to play with a lot of speed, a lot of force, so we didn't start the game as physical as we should have at the point of attack. Also I think we lost track of some of our keys that we came into the game with, allowed us to kind of get sidetracked throughout the course of the game.  Then in the second quarter, our second-quarter lineup didn't do a great job of paying attention to detail, and they was able to bust the game open and score 33 points in that second quarter.  They had 39 for the whole second half.  Allowing them to score 60 in the first half is not the type of game that we want to play."
2016-05-21,38:50,24.0,0.529,8.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, Kyrie [Irving] and Kevin [Love] both struggled tonight shooting, looked like for different reasons.  How do you evaluate how they played and how much more does that put on you when they struggle shooting the ball like they did? Le","I think it's good for them.  It's good for them.  First little adversity, first individually in a long time, and I think it's good for them.  I think they'll be much better obviously on Monday, but it's good for them.  When someone is not shooting the ball extremely well, obviously we don't want two of our big guys not to shoot the ball -- it's going to be difficult for us to pull the game out like that.  Even though with our shooting in the 30s, it was still a five-point game at one point in the third quarter.  But we know they'll be much better.  J.R. did a great job of trying to pick the slack up for both Kyrie and for Kev.  Channing [Frye] tried as well and I did as well.  But those guys will be better.  They'll watch the film, and they'll be much better on Monday."
2016-05-21,38:50,24.0,0.529,8.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,The Raptors were saying that tonight Bismack was sort of their energy guy and that's sort of the role he plays on this team.  What did you think of the performance he had tonight? Le,"That's what he's been at home and every playoff and every regular-season game.  We understand he feeds off the crowd, but he's also a huge impact on the glass at home.  He gives them a lot of energy, he gives them a lot of second-chance points.  He had eight offensive rebounds.  He cleaned up the glass on all of our misses in the first half.  I think he had at one point 14 rebounds and no points.  The guy just stays in his lane.  He definitely gave them a boost tonight."
2016-05-21,38:50,24.0,0.529,8.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,"Bismack Biyombo is doing some of the Dikembe Mutombo finger wagging from years ago.  When you see him do that, what kind of reaction do both of you have? Le","Same way you've got right now.  We don't really have a reaction.  He has a great block, we're trying to get back on defense.  We're not watching him wave his finger.  But he probably admires him.  We all take something from somebody.  If I shoot a fadeaway, I got it from MJ.  Throw a no-look pass, I get it from Magic.  He [J.R. Smith] shoots fadeaway threes, I don't know where he gets those from.  We all admire somebody, so it's no big deal."
2016-05-21,38:50,24.0,0.529,8.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, your normal response to physical play is to kind of dust yourself off and move on to the next play and avoid retaliation.  At what point does that change, could that change? Le","That's a great question.  You know, obviously teams and a lot of players are kind of taking it a little bit.  At the end of the day, I'm important to this team.  I can't afford to react in any kind of way that will get me thrown out of a game, but I will protect myself.  I will protect myself.  When I was in high school, I got low-bridged playing in an AAU tournament as a junior in high school.  A kid just low-bridged me and I fell and broke my wrist.  That kind of thought always plays in my mind either when I'm getting thrown to the ground or if it's a borderline dirty play.  I always think back to the Jay Z phrase and a line he had: ""If I shoot you, then I'm brainless; if you shoot me, you're famous.  What am I to do?""  That always plays in my head.  Every time I feel like I want to react, I've got to keep my brain."

Le","I'm not trying to sell a call.  I got hit with an elbow.  I didn't know from my own teammate.  I thought it was DeMarre [Carroll], but I watched the replay, it was from my teammate.  So no -- sell a call for what?  There was no call there to be sold.  That's it.  I was going to say something else to you, but I'm going to leave it alone. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, we were talking a little bit about it back there, but you score 14 possessions in a row, and it's not enough to put them away.  How frustrating was it from a defensive side that as well as you played offensively it wasn't enough there at the end? Le","It wasn't enough because we got off to a horrible first half once again in this building, and you're playing catch-up the whole game.  So every defensive possession feels even more intensified when you've given up so many points in the first half.  I think they've averaged 58 or something like that in the first half here, and in the high 30s the second half.  It gets a little bit more intensified, but it just goes back to the first half.  We're not starting off games the right way.  The second quarter has been really bad for us here, so we've got do a better job of that where we can't dig ourselves such a big hole and now every possession feels even more intensified late in the game."
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,You guys shot 14 threes the first quarter.  A lot of them were open looks but they weren't falling.  You seemed to move off of the line after that.  Was that by design? Le,"Well, I mean, of course.  We've got to be more well-balanced.  We started the game, we had some great looks, but when they're not going, you've got to be able to try to switch it up and get into the paint and see what you can do.  I was able to get into the paint a little bit, Kyrie [Irving] as well.  But we just haven't shot the ball from the three-point line.  That's part of what they're doing as well, but it's part of us being a little bit more conscious about, okay, if it's not going down, then we've got to get into the paint a little bit more and then kick out for threes as well."
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,You said this morning you had a game plan for yourself.  From the outside it didn't look drastically different the way you played tonight compared to the other series.  Did you have something different in mind? Le,"I think I played to the game plan that I wanted to play, both offensively and defensively.  For me, I gave everything that I had in the 46 minutes that I played, both offensively and defensively.  I felt great.  Tried to get my guys involved, get myself involved.  My individual game plan was pretty good."
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,In the second quarter you mentioned you guys got outscored 30-17.  Was it a matter of effort or execution or what was going on? Le,"I don't know.  I've got to watch the film to see the mistakes that we made.  But they put it on us good in the second quarter, obviously 30-17.  I think Kyle [Lowry] hit some huge shots in that second quarter.  [DeMar] DeRozan hit some big shots as well.  I've got to go over the film, but obviously 30-17 is not a good ingredient for a win."
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,How difficult is it to overcome when two players on the opposing team both go for 30 plus? Le,"Well, first of all you tip your hat to DeMar and Kyle.  They did a great job.  They're All-Stars for a reason.  That's why they're here today.  They've carried this team all season.  But even at the end of the day, as well as they played, we still had a chance.  We still had a chance to win the ballgame.  That's all you can ask for.  But what we can't do is dig ourselves the hole that we did in the first half."
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,"When you guys started executing like that in the second half offensively and everything was clicking, it was crisp passing.  How can you transfer that same type of execution on the defensive end? Le","I think defensively when we made that run, we played some really good defense.  I think we had a couple breakdowns that I know in my head that happened throughout the run, but they also made some tough shots.  They made some tough shots.  They made some tough shots while we were making that run.  Cory Joseph made a tough runner over the top of me going right.  I think Kyle made a couple tough ones.  DeMar made a couple pull-ups as well.  We followed our game plan as much as 95 percent of the time.  I can remember two plays that I'm not going to say right now that I wish we had back.  But while we made our run, our defense stepped up, and that was good to see."
2016-05-23,45:48,29.0,0.688,9.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0,"That fourth quarter, with that second unit group that you played with, that's when you guys started getting your mojo back.  As the quarter came to a close, other players started coming back in.  My question is is that lineup that you had right there, is that built to go the distance, or is it just a stopgap? Le","I think whatever lineup coach [Tyronn] Lue puts on the floor can go the distance.  We're all professionals.  We have a great group of guys, so no matter who's on the floor, we have to execute.  We have to play to our identity.  I think our second unit did a great job of giving us a boost and whoever comes in after that has to continue to play at a high level. We do a great job as a first unit at times of picking up our second unit, and then at times our second unit does a great job of picking us up.  At the end of the day, whoever is on the floor, we have to play with the same intensity both offensively and defensively."

You do such a good job getting your teammates involved, and when you get the trap and double-team, you find the open man for good shots. Le","I've been blessed with a gift to pass the ball and to see the floor, and I just try to take advantage to help my teammates.  I think that's one of my biggest gifts.  I love getting my guys involved and making them feel a part of something special.  Even me being in my 13th year in the NBA, it all started when I was a kid.  My little league coach always said, There's no I in team.  Obviously, we've all heard that, but when you get guys involved, it makes the game a lot easier.  It's always stuck with me to this point today."

What has happened this weekend, and when you look in the eyes of all the guys in your room, what do you see about the future? Le","I think it's a sense of the outsiders, which I've never really got involved with, saying we may never lose another game.  I don't get involved in it, besides talking to you guys and when I see you guys, is all I know about it.  I don't know anything that's going on outside because I don't watch.  I don't watch sports TV.  I don't read news clippings.  I go home and I watch cartoons with my kids and watch movie channels and Man Vs. Wild and things like that because that's what really is important to me. What the outside people say, I don't really get involved with.  And I am a confident guy.  I'm always confident in my ability and what I can bring to my team, whatever the case may be, whatever the circumstances are.  Going back home, we have to play a lot better, and I think we will."

With as good a team as you are and as good of a player as you are, do you feel like when you took the lead by three, you had them at that point? Le","I definitely thought we had finally got over the curve of how we wanted to play here in this building.  But you've still got to get stops, and they did a great job of just making shot after shot after shot, even when our run was happening.  You give them a lot of credit with that.  They withstand our run and us giving up 54 percent shooting, a lot of it in the first half.  Like I said, when you dig a hole like that, I think we were down by 18 at one point.  Again, when you dig a hole like that, like I said, every possession after that is so intensified.  We got to a point where we were up, but we made a couple more mistakes and they was able to pull away."

Is switching effective with these two guys when they know that's what you guys are doing? Le","I think they did a good job of kind of moving him around.  With me on him, they feel like trying to get me up off of him with a screen, either with a guard so they can force the switch -- that's part of our defense.  But when they screen with a big, we have a goal that we want to try to attack. I think we'll be a lot better on what we want to do and how we want to handle those two guys, because they're playing exceptional basketball.  They're 28 for 43.  I mean, that's top-of-the-tier numbers right there, and they both went for 30.  We've got to be much better in our schemes and doing it a little bit harder as well.

Le","We understood that coming back from Game 3 and Game 4 we just didn't play our defense the right way.  We didn't play how we should have played, and they took advantage of every moment.  We had to get back to our staple.  We had to get back to what we wanted to do defensively in order for us to play a complete game.  That was the most satisfying thing, the way we defended, holding these guys to 39 percent shooting."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you spoke this morning about just a sense of calm.  How much of that was just how many times you've been here before, and was there any part of it that you knew what was going to happen tonight, you knew that was still in there? Le","I've been a part of some really adverse situations, and I just didn't believe that this was one of them.  So it's just been very calm about the whole situation, understanding that our guys knew what we did and what we didn't accomplish in Toronto.  I'm not taking away from the fact how big of a game this was, because it is -- it's a Game 5 on our home floor and the series tied 2-2.  But from the very moment that we lost Game 4, I was just very calm about the whole situation, seeing the good that we can prepare and get better for Game 5 instead of looking at all the bad that we did.  Just mentally just having these guys focus, and they answered the call."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"First of all, when Kevin Love throws you an outlet pass in full stride, not everybody can do that on either end.  Explain the dynamics of what makes that such a great basketball play. Le","Well, first of all, like you stated in the first part, having someone like Kevin who can make that pass.  He's been throwing outlet passes, chest passes full court, for a long time now, probably all the way back to high school.  Obviously we saw it at UCLA, we saw it at Minnesota, and now we're starting to get that connection here, and we have it.  For me, it's fun for me that I can be a receiver again, taking me back to my football days, and just try to keep the cornerback on my hip and not look up until the ball gets there, and then I'm able to finish.  It was a huge play, and in that particular case, we kind of even talked about it while the jump ball was going on with Swish [J.R. Smith] and he was able to lead me to the rim and I was able to finish."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,Also we talked about how Kevin is feeling more connected to the team and maybe coming out of his shell a little bit more.  What is it that you saw tonight that makes you think that that's true? Le,"Well, I don't believe that's true to the first part.  Kevin has always been out of his shell; he just doesn't do it around you guys because it's not about that.  What we do as a team, we keep everything in house, and besides RJ [Richard Jefferson] bringing out Little Kev recently, everything has been in house.  But Kevin is a great guy, a great teammate, and tonight was just a bounce-back for him.  He knew he didn't play his style of basketball or how he wanted to play to help us win in Toronto.  He wanted to make a different outcome of it, and he did that tonight.  He's a true professional."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, when you did have playoff struggles early in your career and everybody, the whole world was watching, you were able to bounce back from that and get yourself to a point to have accomplishments.  You kind of saw that play out for Kevin.  When we spoke after Game 3, you said, we're going to help him, but also he kind of has to do it for himself.  What's that process like seeing him, I guess, achieve that first challenge? Le","I mean, it's very difficult and you feel like you're by yourself.  I've been there before, when you're a big part of a puzzle, and things just don't go the way you either dreamed about it or the way you thought it was going to be.  You feel like you're by yourself for 24 hours or 48 hours or however long the case may be.  To see him come out the way he did tonight, just aggressive from the beginning, his first bucket, his first paint touch -- his first touch was in the paint, a right-hand jump hook.  We knew from that point on that that's where he wanted it, and we continued to go to him.  So it was great to see him bounce back like that."

You haven't had to do that, and I'm curious to ask in this game in particular, you see a blowout fashion, I think people would assume that you just took over from start to finish.  How is this team still able to be so effective and you stay within the team system and stick to the script? Le","Because we didn't get to this point in our season by me taking over every game.  I kind of laugh at it when I hear from you guys, when I do my media availability, people saying take over the game.  My presence on the floor is much bigger than what numbers talk about.  When you have a young superstar like this guy [Irving], you have Kevin, who's a superstar as well, and they've helped us get to this point, so you don't just throw in the kitchen sink because we lose two games or we didn't play as well as we could.  There may be a time when I may have to have one of those big games, but until then, just relax."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, with the limited minutes you've been able to play the last two games and the type of basketball you potentially have ahead of you here, what does it do for your body to be able to only play under 32 minutes in a Game 5? Le","It's great for sure.  Any time you're able to clock in under, for me, 35 minutes, it's great.  But my body has been trained all season to do whatever it takes.  Tonight was one of those instances where I didn't need it as much, but I've trained my body over quite a few months now to -- whatever Coach needs me, whenever this team needs me, I'll be ready for it."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,You said earlier today on Uninterrupted that you like the pressure of Game 5 because it's going to show you what this team is all about.  What do you think the team showed tonight? Le,"That they were ready for it as well.  They were ready for this moment.  Our crowd was ready for this moment.  They were amazing, as always.  Give a lot of thanks to those guys.  They were amazing from the beginning.  It starts with our floor general.  Our floor general came out, and I think he had 12 in the first quarter.  He got to where he wanted to get on the floor, his pull-up was working, his three in transition was working; e led the team, put us in position to succeed.  And obviously Kev had a huge first quarter as well.  Everybody else just followed their lead after that."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you guys were so dominant in rebounding tonight, but when you're playing against a team that has so many big guys like the Thunder, how can you be sure you maintain the same great performance in rebounding? Le","Well, for us, rebounding is always a big part of our staple, especially for Double-T [Tristan Thompson] and for Kevin, for myself, and Ky is starting to get down there a little bit as well.  We want to get stops.  We want to defend, and when you're able to make a team miss, you want to clean the glass, and we were able to do that tonight.  We held them under their shooting averages obviously from the previous two games, so we were able to clean the glass and that allowed us to get out on our break."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"For both of you, how do you take this aggression that you had from the start tonight into Toronto on Friday? Le","It's a huge key to our success.  If we understand that, we put ourselves in the best possible chance of winning.  We showed it in Toronto Game 3 and Game 4 when we got down 16 or 18.  We showed we're capable of doing -- all the way down to Game 4 we had a chance to win.  We've got to come out from the beginning, and it starts with the Big Three.  It starts with myself, Kev and Ky, and we've got to do a great job of pushing the tempo, getting these guys ready, and we'll be much better.  We'll be more prepared.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan in 3 and 4, and we didn't execute it.  But we'll be more prepared."
2016-05-25,31:30,23.0,0.588,6.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,"We've talked a little bit about this before, and then today you've been mentioning about being calm and why.  I'm curious what your streak of consecutive series with at least one road win means to you, and put it within the context of you've got one more chance to extend that to 25 on Friday. Le","Well, you were the first person to bring it up to me.  I had no idea.  I really don't play my career off accomplishments.  If they happen, so be it.  I've been blessed to be in a position where I can play the game that I love and be around some great guys, and my kids get an opportunity to see me do some special things. My only mindset is to at this point get our guys mentally and physically prepared for a heck of a game on Friday night in Toronto, and if we're able to come home victorious, then the streak continues.  If not, we prepare for Game 7.  But that's my mindset.  My mindset has never been about, I guess, records or streaks or things of that nature. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

How do you feel right now within that context? Le",I never got involved in that because we're not entitled to anything.  We earned the right to be here and represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals.  We work our tails off every single day.  We commit to one another and we sacrifice to one another.  We're not supposed to be here; we earned our right.  We earned our right to be here today.
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you seem to be a little bit in awe right after the game with the fans.  Can you just talk about your feelings with both the fans here and what you saw in this building? Le","It's an unbelievable atmosphere.  These fans, they mean a lot to their team, and I think the team gave everything they could throughout this whole season.  To go to a place they've never been before, to get to the Eastern Conference Finals, and to win two games on their home floor as well, in front of their fans throughout this Conference Finals, it just showed their appreciation.  They were unbelievable all season long to this point, and they definitely showed that toward the end of the game, all the way throughout."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, this is the second straight year you guys made The Finals.  Last year obviously last year Kyrie and Kevin, their bodies weren't intact the way they are right now.  What's changed between this year and last year? Le","There's definitely a different feeling.  I didn't appreciate last year myself personally on getting to The Finals.  Just so much was going on in my mind, knowing that Kev was out for the rest of the season and knowing that Ky was dealing with injuries all the way from the first round. I just didn't appreciate it.  It's definitely a different feeling.  Having these guys right here at full strength, having our team at full strength, and the way I feel personally, I appreciate this moment, to be able to be a part of it and to be there once again."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, in a game like this, there are times when you can and will do whatever it takes to win a game for your team.  In this particular case, you had so much help from the guys on your left and your right.  Can you talk about what each of them were able to do and the way you felt watching them do it? Le","We wouldn't be at this point today going to The Finals without those two.  Throughout the first three rounds, they've been the reason why we've played at such a high level.  They've accepted the challenge.  They wanted to get back to this moment.  Ky being out seven months, this guy [Love] doing rehab for three-and-a-half months on his shoulder, they just had so much built up -- anxiety or rage or excitement or whatever the case may be throughout the whole process, just to be back on the floor and to show why we were all put together.  For us to be at this moment, I know they have a lot to say about it, so please don't ask me the next question.  Ask one of those guys."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"From the outside, it looks like there's something special brewing.  It seems like a camaraderie from the first man down to the last man on the roster.  Is that the sense you guys get, as well?  Can you talk about what you guys are feeling and what's going on with this team? Le","It doesn't matter what's going on on the outside.  It's not our problem.  It's not what we're about.  We've got 15 guys, we've got a coaching staff, we've got a fan base, we've got an organization and management and everybody on a day-to-day basis that we represent, and that's all that matters.  We all preach the same words.  We all go about our business the same way every single day.  So what goes on in the outside world doesn't really matter to us.  It just feels great to go out there and sacrifice and play for guys that truly just have the same goal in mind, truly care for one another both on and off the floor, and that's the results of it."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,I may be taking too much of this but last year after you guys clinched to go to The Finals I remember some champagne bottles in the locker room and nothing outrageous but a champagne celebration.  Tonight there was just water on the floor doesn't look like there was any champagne.  I was wondering if there was any significance behind that? Le,"We didn't have champagne, so we took waters. [Laughter] That's it. KEVIN LOVE: I had chocolate milk."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, on the court afterward in the interview with Doris, it seemed like you got a little bit choked up.  Can you give us a sense what the emotion was, and when you hear six straight for you, what does that -- how do you process that? Le","I did.  Like I said, I didn't appreciate last year, what we were able to accomplish in our first year.  I'm just truly blessed.  I mean, the man above has given me an unbelievable ability, and I just try to take full advantage of it and to -- I get to do what I love to do every single night, and that's to play the game of basketball.  That's my life.  It's everything, and I give everything to the game.  To be in a position where I can go out and help a group of guys get to places where either they haven't been before or been but want to accomplish even more in their careers, it just means a lot.  So a lot of emotions were just going through my head at that point in time, talking to Doris, and just appreciating what I've personally been able to do throughout my career so far. It means a lot.  The game of basketball has given me everything, and I would never cheat the game, no matter how many games I win, no matter how many games I lose, that really doesn't matter to me because I really just give it all.  That's why I can sleep well at night."

Being from Akron, how does it feel to kind of have a shot to beat the drought? Le","I don't really get caught up in all of that.  We're going to prepare ourselves.  Our coaching staff will prepare us, and we're going to go out and give it our all, and we're going to live with the results. I know our city deserves it.  Our fans deserve it.  But that gives us no sense of entitlement.  We've still got to go out and do it.  We've still got to go out and prove ourselves and be as great as we can be every single night we hit the floor.  We look forward to the challenge."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, during the regular season you said your team is okay, it's not great.  Where are you guys right now, and which part did you guys improve the most? Le","We're still okay.  We're not great yet.  We've got one more round to become great, so we look forward to it."
2016-05-27,41:15,33.0,0.591,11.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,"Can you tell me what you guys thought of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan coming over before the end of the game to congratulate you guys as they walked off the court?  What did you think of that move, and do you know what you guys said to them? Le","Yeah, we know what we said to them, but I don't think it's for everyone.  But what those two guys have done for this franchise and this city and this fan base, nothing short of amazing.  Being two All-Stars, carrying those guys through a first-round seven-game series, a second-round seven-game series and then a Conference Finals Game 6 in their home building, they were spectacular.  They were great.  These fans here, I know they know what they have, and they sure appreciate talent like DeMar and Kyle.  So it was fun competing against them. They're classy guys.

It seemed like you had the momentum and then there was that small altercation with Delly and Iguodala.  Did that break you guys, the momentum, and did you feel like you guys kind of maybe lost your composure after that happened?","No, we're not a team that loses our composure over anything.  We played well in the third quarter to get ourselves back into the game, even taking the lead a couple times.  It was a six-point game to start the fourth, and we just didn't start the quarter like we should have, and they did a great job of pushing the lead up to double digits really fast."
2016-06-02,40:53,23.0,0.429,12.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,Obviously holding Steph and Klay to a combined 20 would seem to be a great blueprint.  Is it discouraging to then see their bench erupt for 45?,"When you get outscored 45-10 on the bench and give up 25 points off 17 turnovers, no matter what someone does or doesn't do, it's going to be hard to win, especially on the road.  And that's what it was.  Obviously the game ball goes to Shaun Livingston.  Came in, gave them a huge spark. But don't matter what you do with Steph and Klay, don't matter what you do with Draymond.  Give up 45 points off the bench and 25 points off turnovers on the road, it's not a good ingredient to win."
2016-06-02,40:53,23.0,0.429,12.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, taking a step way back from it all, this is your seventh Finals, and I think you've only won Game 1 once.  So you've been in this situation a bunch.  What do you make of just what happened tonight and where you are now and just how you get into this series?","Well, we've got to be much better in Game 2, obviously.  I think defensively we had a game plan and we followed it as much as possible.  Well, as great as we could for 48 minutes.  We had some breakdowns, which we know we can get better with.  Offensively, we've got to be much better.  We've got to be much better moving the ball, moving bodies.  They're a great team when you just hold the ball and pound the ball.  So we've got to do a better job with that, which Coach Lue and the coaching staff will make sure we do in Game 2. So we look forward to the challenge again.  Just two days in between doesn't help.  It doesn't feel good.  But it gives our body a chance to get some rest."
2016-06-02,40:53,23.0,0.429,12.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, obviously this team and this series is a lot different than last year.  But how much different after this game here do you think it is?",I don't quite get your question.
2016-06-02,40:53,23.0,0.429,12.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,"The Warriors roster is the same, but last year it was Curry, it was Klay and some of those guys taking over.  But after Game 1, having the bench go and score 45 points, does that change your view of how this series might go and what you have to prepare for?","I think you're wrong in the fact of saying it was just Klay and Steph.  I mean, they got to the point where they were last year and won a championship because of their whole team and their bench.  And they're here once again in The Finals because of their whole team.  So nothing has really changed. They're a team that's had another year under their belt, and they've exceeded what they did last year.  So it's kind of hard to answer that question because it's not really true."
2016-06-02,40:53,23.0,0.429,12.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,What's happened with our bench?  Your bench combined scored 10 points and J.R. scored three points?,"What happened?  They scored 45 points, we scored 10.  That's what happened."

This is a loss in Game 1.  This is The Finals.  A stage like that, this is a time where some younger players can possibly get overwhelmed.  What have you seen from the other guys?","Well, I think they look forward to seeing what we can do better tomorrow in our film session and seeing ways we can get better going into Game 2.  Yeah, we've got some young guys, but as far as confidence in those guys not believing, that's never been the case for us or any of the guys in the locker room. I know they're excited.  We had a chance in that third quarter to do something special, but we didn't counter and do it.  Didn't make it happen in the fourth quarter. So I'm looking forward to seeing the film session and seeing ways we can get better going into Game 2, and I think our team will as well."
2016-06-02,40:53,23.0,0.429,12.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,You guys had 17 assists in this game tonight.  Were you happy with the flow of the offense?  It seemed like you and Kyrie a lot of times were taking it upon yourself to try to score?,"At times I was and at times I wasn't.  We've definitely got to do a better job getting the ball moving side-to-side, getting their bodies moving.  They're a great team.  When you have the ball on one side, they're able to load and do things of that nature. So, you know, we will have a better game plan going into Game 2 for sure offensively.  Sometimes your offense dictates your defense, and the fact that we had 17 turnovers and that led to 25 points is not a good ingredient for our offense for sure."

Anything you can do knowing about his wingspan, his quickness, and his anticipation to prevent that?","Well, he's great at doing that, for sure.  Just got to do a better job protecting the ball.  It's that simple. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

I'm not disappointed in our guys or frustrated.  We've just got to do a better job.  We've got to be better at all facets of the game both offensively and defensively, both physically and mentally. They just beat us at every -- we didn't win anything.  No points of the game did we beat them in anything.  Even when we had an early lead, they beat us to 50-50 balls, they got extra possessions, they got extra tip-ins.  They beat us pretty good tonight."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,"I realize you're a team player, but is there a point where you say I have to be more selfish to help my team out in this series?","Selfish is probably the wrong term.  I got myself in a lot of trouble tonight personally.  Turned the ball over way too much.  And I said after Game 1 we just can't turn the ball over against a great team and expect to win, and I had basically half of the turnovers.  We had some in the fourth quarter, but we had our third group in.  They had some.  But I had half of the turnovers when I came out, and it resulted in them getting some easy baskets. So I've got to be better.  I've got to be better with the ball.  You know, trying to play make for myself and play make for my teammates at the same time, I've just got to be more solid."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,"Just following up on the turnover situation.  You guys didn't have any turnovers in the first quarter, and you held them to 19 points.  Do you feel one of the key things to get this turned around at home is if you can keep those turnovers down you can slow down the game, and, like you said, keep them out of transition?","Well, that's one of them.  That's one way to slow them down a little bit.  You're able to set your defense.  The game kind of broke open when we had two straight turnovers.  I think game was at 28-22, I turned the ball over.  Draymond got it and was able to hit I think Livingston for a dunk.  And then we had another turnover and Klay hit a three, and that kind of slowed us down.  Even though we were still getting back in the game, it just slowed us down from that point on.  We had the lead, and it started with my turnover, and I can't just be careless with the ball, especially in the paint where a lot of reaching and things of that nature happen. So 18 turnovers once again for 26 points, I think it was 17 for 25 in Game 1.  It's just not good basketball."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,You gave your squad headphones before the game today with an inspirational quote.  What was your message to them and did they receive it?,"I give my teammates stuff throughout the whole year.  All the time.  It's no different.  We understand the moment that we're in, and it's not -- it's not every year that you get an opportunity to be in this situation, you know?  And some of the guys on our team, it's their first time and they've waited their whole life to get to this point. So we know we've got to just do a little bit better.  We've got to play better.  We've got to play a lot better in order to get this series turned around.  I know the other side is looking forward to coming to our building where they had a lot of success last year, so we've got to bear down."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,"Last year with all the injuries and the adversity and the odds, you know, you guys just gutted your way to two wins.  Now you've got -- until Kevin went down, but otherwise everybody was healthy, and Ty Lue's here and everything.  Most of the buttons he had pushed had been working.  Is there a sense that maybe you guys are just let down because of what you've done through all these Playoffs just isn't working?","We've got to get back to the film and we all have to figure out ways we can help the team be successful.  It's hard for me to kind of pinpoint what's not working and what could work right now.  Obviously not much is working, especially offensively.  Defensively we've been good at times and then at times we just looked like, okay, we're a step slow.  We messed up on the coverage.  We don't get back or we're just one step behind where we should be.  We should be closer to our man.  When you're behind these guys, they make you pay every single time. We can't have as many mental lapses.  More on the physical, it's a lot of mental as well.  These guys put you in so many mental positions where you have to figure it out, and they make you pay for it when you don't."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, the last couple months you guys are the team they've been talking about, how different you guys are.  You're different, you're not the team from last year this season.  In these last two games in particular, has it been that you guys have slipped and fallen from what has made you different, or is it something the Warriors have done to take away what you guys have established?","What we've done these last two games doesn't put a damper or a cloud over how we got to this point.  We're still here and we have a chance to turn this series around if we come in and do what we need to do both offensively and defensively.  So I'm not worried about that side or what the conversations may be about.  Internally we have to figure out how we can be better.  We have to figure out how we can help one another.  We definitely have to figure out how we can get more guys involved.  15 assists, it's not winning basketball, especially versus this team.  We've just got to figure it out.  Coaching staff will give us a game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute it."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,"After the 2014 Finals, I remember you were asked was that the best team you've ever faced, and you said, yeah, I'd agree with that.  Have these Warriors changed your mind on that?","2014 is something I haven't even thought about.  This is a great team, and I stated that before the series ever started.  They've got two of the best shooters that we've ever seen, and they're a great team.  So I've already stated that."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,You are shouldering some of the blame for this and say you didn't live up to the way you like to play.  How do you process a loss when you do feel like it could be part of your fault versus maybe it's out of your control?  What are the next couple days going to be like for you?,"The next couple days will be not -- I won't be reflecting.  I'll figure out ways I can be better, starting as soon as I leave this podium.  Probably go back to the room and watch the game, re-watch for ways I could have been better.  I had a lot of uncharacteristic unforced turnovers which resulted in those guys getting 26 points off turnovers.  So I'm one of the guys who kind of always wants to shoulder the blame and take the blame when we don't play as well as we should.  It's just who I am, and I've got to be better."
2016-06-05,33:38,19.0,0.412,8.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0,Draymond Green has never scored more than 16 points against you guys in a Finals game until tonight.  What was it about everything that happened in that game that made Draymond such a force at both ends of the floor tonight?,"He made shots.  Give credit where credit is due.  The guy made shots.  Not only when we left him open and contested late, but he made shots in our face.  He had five threes.  And we know he's a key for their team, we all know that, an All-Star for their team.  And he made some big plays both offensively and defensively, obviously.  We know what he does defensively for that team, so game ball to him. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

How do you equate losing by 30 and winning by 30 in such short order?  Especially when you're whole to start one game, and then not whole with Kevin in the locker room, how do you make sense of the 63-point turnaround? Le","At the end of the day, no matter if you lose by 30 or 1, it's just one win.  And you have to be able to have a short mind but also learn from the mistakes that you made the previous game and just try to better yourself in the following game.  And that's what we're able to do.  We had a great shootaround yesterday.  We had a great shootaround this morning.  Coach Lue and the coaching staff gave us a great game plan and it was just up to us to go out and execute that, and I think we did that tonight."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, for a couple days you had talked about needing to compete harder and play harder, effort.  Ty just said the same thing.  In a Finals, how can that be the issue?  Do you feel like your guys have gotten over it? Le","Don't think it's an issue.  You know, it's just something that we wanted to pinpoint and do better.  You could say we wanted to move the ball better the next game.  We want to dribble-drive the next game.  Those are not issues.  Those are things that we want to be better at in the next game, and I think we did that tonight."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,"So much was made of the narrative of the second units and the difference of the contributions.  Now you win a Game 120-90.  But the first unit, you guys went 105-57.  How do you make sense of that kind of dominance between the starting lineups against that team?  Offense, defense, can you describe what the key is there to win by 50 points? Le","Well, they're a great team and they have a great starting lineup, and they have great complementary players that come off the bench.  It's never about us versus their starting five.  It's about the whole 15 group.  Our 15 guys versus their 15 guys and who can execute as close to 48 minutes as possible. We did a great job, and I gave the game ball to RJ.  Getting the start tonight with Kevin being out, he just came in with so much aggression, so much attention to detail.  He was on the glass.  He gave us eight rebounds and nine points.  But some of the things that he was doing out on the floor did not show up in the boxscore. So we just want to try to play our game.  We finally got back to our game tonight, and it started with the floor general to my left.  The sharpshooter to my right got it going, and it was just good basketball.  It was a good flow, and everyone felt like they were a part of tonight's win.  So it was just a collective team win.  It wasn't about us versus their starting five.  It was just about how everyone can get the job done whoever is on the floor."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, tonight I think you started 4-of-4 and then you struggled and got it going in the second half.  Can you take us through your roller coaster shooting, and what got you going again in that second half, especially with your jumper? Le","My teammates got me going.  They told me to be aggressive, and that's what I was."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,LeBron how different is this team when it gets a contribution like it did tonight from Jump Shot Jesus over here? Le,"Well, I mean, he's like you said, he's a two-way player.  Defensively all year long that's what he's been doing.  The offense comes very free to him and very easy, but the defensive side is what's making him so great.  The contribution that we got from him from the scoring was all predicated on what he did defensively, you know, and he got in great rhythm.  He hit some huge shots for us tonight, obviously, but I think it all started on the defensive end where he was much better than he was offensively."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,There was a play after the whistle where Steph was trying to go up and do a lay-up or a dunk I guess to try to get it him rhythm and you blocked his shot.  Was that a way to set the tone that there wasn't going to be any easy shots tonight?  And can you talk a little bit about how much better your defensive communication was tonight. Le,"Oh, well, when you have the greatest shooter in the world trying to get an easy one or trying to get in rhythm, it's our job to try to keep him out.  No matter if it's after the whistle or not.  That was just my mindset.  Anytime, if you're a great player and you see the ball go in, no matter if it's after the play or during the play, then you start feeling it.  Not that you feel good because you know what you're capable of, but it helps.  So I didn't want him to see the ball go in, even though he still made some."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,How much did you playing in the post tonight change the dynamic of this game?  And what was your approach to Draymond? Le,"Well, I mean, I just wanted to play a little bit inside and outside.  I started off the game going in the interior and just trying to fan out their defense a little bit.  We did a great job of spacing out with RJ, with Ky, and also with Swish, so it gave me a little bit more room to work down in the post. I missed a ton of chippies, but I was loving the space that I was getting and my teammates created for me.  So just kind of following the game plan.  It's something that we wanted to do tonight and were able to execute it."
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,How much did you guys change defensively what you wanted to do?  It looked like you weren't switching as much as you were in the first two. Le,Coaching staff gave us a game plan and we went out and executed it.
2016-06-08,40:04,32.0,0.538,11.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1,"You've heard it from us over the last couple days of asking you if you're going to take over this game, if you're going to do this or do that.  When it was official that Kevin Love was going to be out for this game, did you have to change your approach at all going into this game or you pretty much played like yourself? Le","No, I didn't change my approach, and I didn't take over this game.  Kyrie pretty much took over the game, especially early and late.  He closed the game out.  He started the game, and I just sprinkled in, you know, my production along the whole game. He took the game over, I guess, from that standpoint.  I just try to lead these guys to victory.

2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, Steph hit the three, and it was like 5:55 left in the fourth quarter, and you guys called a timeout.  You guys came out of timeout.  Can you talk about if that was exactly what you guys wanted?  It seemed like after that the offense kind of sputtered. Le",I don't know.  I'm trying to replay it back.  I'm not quite sure what we ran out of timeout.
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,They went up nine.  They went up nine at that point. Le,"Yeah, I'm not sure what we ran out the timeout when we came back out on the floor.  But our offense did stall a little bit in the fourth quarter.  We played a little bit too much random, trying to dribble drive, get guys looks, and then we started settling a little bit for the three-point shot when we kind of got down.  Which obviously we've got to do a better job of that. But we had our chances.  I think the third quarter was a momentum swing for us, and they took advantage of it."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,What is your mindset heading into the next game? Le,"My mindset is get one.  You know, we've got to go out there and play obviously better than we played tonight.  Better than even we played in Game 3.  But we've got to get one.  It's not about overlooking this.  It's about getting one on their home floor where they've been very successful.  So, you know, we've got to come in with the mindset that our coaching staff is going to give us a great game plan and we've got to execute that.  We're about the results after."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, you had words with Draymond and Steph.  What kind of got you going and what were you saying to them? Le","Oh, nothing got me going.  You know, Draymond just said something that I don't agree with.  I'm all cool with the competition.  I'm all fine with that, but some of the words that came out of his mouth were a little bit overboard, and being a guy with pride, a guy with three kids and a family, things of that nature, some things just go overboard and that's where he took it, and that was it."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,Anything with Steph? Le,"No, no.  That conversation was competitive conversation.  I'm okay with that."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,I think you had four free throws tonight the entire game.  Just your thoughts on that and some of the calls tonight? Le,"Well, it's been like that all year for the most part.  I'm not quite sure what I can do personally to get to the free-throw line, but I've got to continue to be aggressive for our team.  I'm getting hit, but the refs are not seeing it that way, on my drives.  But I've got to continue to be aggressive for our team.  That's who I am, that's what opens up the floor for a lot of our shooters, and just worry about the results afterwards. You know, it's tough playing 46 minutes and only going to the line four times, as much as I attack the rim.  So it's just a tough situation for our team."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"I do have a question for Kyrie, too, but I wanted to follow up with Draymond.  LeBron, I think you've seen it now, he got you in the groin during that.  Especially given Draymond's situation with the flagrants and whatnot, do you have any opinion on what happened there, what should happen? Le","Well, I don't know what should happen.  It's not my call.  That's the league office.  They'll take a look at it.  We all saw it in the locker room.  You know, like I said, as a competitor, I love going against Draymond, and I'm all about going out there and leaving it out on the floor.  But when it gets a little bit more than what it should be, that's what caused me to have words with him. So as far as the play, I think the league will take a look at it.  Obviously our locker room has seen it, and we'll see what they say."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"Do you expect that the league -- whether or not you think they should, do you expect that they would? Le",No.
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, what do you tell yourself the next two-and-a-half days?  And what do you tell your guys the next two-and-a-half days when you know the enormity now with the chips stacked against you? Le","Obviously, if you want to look to that side, then you put too much pressure on yourself.  I think for me as the leader of this team, we've just got to get one.  Let's get one.  We've already got to take a flight home back anyways, so we might as well come home with a win and play on our home floor again.  Being a confident bunch we feel like the chips have been stacked up against us all year anyway. So we've got to learn from our mistakes tonight, which we made some and we go out with the mindset let's get one and then bring it home."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"For either of you guys, did you feel the fatigue played a factor at all in this game? Le",No.  Not at all. KYRIE IRVING: No excuses.
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, for you, you and Kyrie combined for 33 of the 38 shot attempts in the second half.  Is that a number that you're comfortable with in a game? Le","Well, we've got to be aggressive.  Our coach, Coach Lue told us to be aggressive.  And obviously, we don't like to hear it in that form.  We want to get our guys involved and keep our guys in a good rhythm.  I just think it was just the way the game played out tonight."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"For both of you guys, the story of the first three games in large part was how Curry was having trouble affecting the games, he sort of got loose from you guys tonight.  What did you both see that they did so successful compared to the other three games? Le","Well, first of all, he's a great player, and we know that.  And we knew he was going to come out and be aggressive.  Because of how the first three games went, and we knew he was going to be aggressive. We made some mistakes and he made us pay for them.  He made us pay every time we made a mistake defensively, and he shot the ball extremely well from the three-point line.  We tried to keep a body on him when he went to the paint, where he struggled a little bit, but when he went to the three-point line, he made us pay."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"Beginning of the fourth quarter you guys are up by two points.  They go on a big run and rip off a 12-1 run.  You guys sort of, it was like you were playing in quicksand a little bit there.  What was the experience like as that's sort of starting to happen for you?  What was changing for them that was making it more difficult for you to get stops? Le","They started making shots and then they started getting stops.  They did it on both sides of the floor.  It starts with, I believe, Harrison Barnes'  three at the top of the key.  That was a big shot to kind of get their rhythm going.  Then they got some offensive rebounds, some second-chance points and then defensively they got stops."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"LeBron, from Game 1 you talked about turnovers.  You got a couple of high-turnover games, this one included.  But you just talked about the referees.  Do you believe some of those turnovers are being called because you're not getting the calls or is it something else that's going on? Le","I didn't talk about the referees.  I was asked a question and I answered it.  I'm going to save my 25K, okay.  So I have not talked about the referees.  Don't put me in that cloud.  I haven't been solid with the basketball.  A lot of it is making plays not only for myself but for my teammates. Some of my aggression turnovers I'm okay with.  I think I had two careless ones.  One came at the end of the game where Steph picked it off.  Another one came early in the third quarter where Bogut trapped the box and I tried to hit Double T.  Draymond stepped in front of it.  But some of them were attack turnovers.  Trying to squeeze the ball into tight places as a quarterback would, and I'm okay with those.  But some of those that are careless, I'm not okay with that."
2016-06-10,45:34,25.0,0.524,13.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,4.0,0,"You guys got Kevin Love back tonight, and he talked about being accepting of his role coming off the bench.  I wonder what impact you felt that had getting him back in the lineup, and how that might help you guys going forward? Le","Well, for two years, any time we've gotten anyone back from injury or sickness or whatever, it's been a boost for our team, and tonight was another one.  I mean, getting them back, seeing him out on the floor and him making the impact, especially in the first half when he hit a couple shots, he was able to get a layup off a offensive rebound.  He started the fourth on a post-up, that was a big play for us. So I know he probably felt out of rhythm.  It was a different situation for him that he hasn't experienced in quite a few years.  But anytime we get someone back from injury or anything, it's a boost for our team. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"For either one of you guys, how did Draymond Green's absence affect you offensively and also defensively?","I think from a mental standpoint it wasn't about anybody that was on the floor.  We just had a mindset that we wanted to come in here and just try to extend our period and have another opportunity to fight for another day.  And that was our main concern, and we were able to do that."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"Last year after Game 5, I think I asked you a question that made significant headlines, and the answer was very controversial.  Does a game like this in which you break crazy records, does it remind you of what inspired you to say that last year?","Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and as one of the leaders of the team, we just went out and executed.  You've got a guy like this who is very special, it's probably one of the greatest performances I've ever seen live.  To put on the show that he did, you just go out and follow the keys and play winning basketball, and we did that tonight."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you just mentioned that Kyrie's game tonight was one of the best performances you've ever seen.  And maybe that will affect how you answer this, but how does your game, the way you played tonight, compare with your Boston game from 2012, the 45-15?","I think the main thing is that we were able to give ourselves another chance.  Going into Boston, being down 3-2, you know, we understood that, hey, listen, the season is over if we don't go out and try to take care of business.  Being a big part of our success, I had to come out and do some things to help us win that ballgame, and tonight was just another example of that.  Understood the magnitude of this game.  I knew how great of a team we were playing, but I just had to come out and just -- I know my teammates trust me, I trust them, and that was the result of it."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"Both of you guys have talked all series about trying to play the right way and make sure other guys stay involved.  But I wanted to know, I'm curious, before this game did you guys know going in that it would have to take this, what you guys did, 82 points combined in order to get this win?  Did you know you had to take it to another level?","At this point, it's whatever it takes.  Obviously making shots and things of that nature are something that you sometimes really can't control.  Sometimes the ball go in; sometimes it don't.  How hard you play, how locked in you are on the keys to get a victory, what the coaching staff put out for us.  But he was -- obviously this guy was special, and we rode him to the victory line."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, you said this was one of the greatest performances you've ever seen in the Playoffs, and you've seen a lot of them.  Kyrie's only played six games in the NBA Finals.  What was it about his performance that really was epic for you?","Just calm.  Just calm for 48 minutes.  Obviously he played 40 minutes, but even in the 8 minutes that he was sitting down, he was just calm.  Timely bucket after bucket that led our team.  The fourth quarter, I mean, he hit timely shot after shot after shot when those guys were trying to get back into the game. Defensively he was phenomenal as well, guarding Steph and guarding the rest of those guys, whoever he was matched up on.  They tried to post him a few times with Harrison Barnes, and he just made it tough on him.  Got his hand on the ball a couple times on the post.  He was just locked in on both sides of the floor.  So that's what I saw, and that's why I said what I said."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"You seemed to have the ball in your hands more tonight than you have in quite a while, and Ty told us that was kind of by design.  Why was tonight the right time to go back to that, and why did you want the ball in your hands?","Well, it's the only time.  I mean, obviously it's do or die for us.  Coach Lue said he wanted the ball in my hands a little bit more.  I finally did a great job of not turning the ball over and got to my spots, got my teammates involved.  Just tried to put us in position to be successful.  Obviously it's not always a bed of roses on the court for 48 minutes, but you just try to go out there and trust your keys.  That's something I'm very comfortable with, and I've been comfortable with before in the past.  Coach wanted to make that adjustment, and I was able to take advantage of it when I had the ball in my hands."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"You've obviously played against a lot of -- or been in a lot of venues that have been hostile throughout your career, including the last two games against Toronto.  How was it different tonight and how do you feed off the energy?  Do you enjoy making the crowd go home like that?  How do you feed off that energy?","I mean, I guess when you're done with a game of basketball and big moments like tonight and moments throughout your career you wish you could get back.  No matter how loud you turn the stereo system up in your house, you'll never be able to get it back.  You just don't take these moments for granted, no matter if you're at home or on the road."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,That's okay.  Maybe a month?,"That would classify as date (smiling). KYRIE IRVING: March, March -- no, I don't know (laughing).  The only thing that really matters is right now.  I'm sorry, I can't answer a specific date or something like that."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,I was just thinking maybe the end of the last three or four weeks of the season.,"I think it was then.  I think it was like as soon as I was coming back to the team, I think we clicked right away. KYRIE IRVING: Yeah, when he announced he was coming back.  I think that's it (laughing)."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"Obviously, there's plenty of motivation for you guys going in down 3-1, but was there any added fuel extra at all after Klay said what he said yesterday, after Speights tweeting and some of the sniping that was going on yesterday?","First of all, I'm not on social media right now, so I don't even know what Speights said, and I really don't think that even matters (laughing).  You guys make me laugh.  I swear, you guys do. My only motivation is my teammates and my coaching staff, especially being in this building.  It's just us, us versus the Warriors.  They have an unbelievable fan base.  So many other things that we have to be challenged about.  So my only motivation is how can I be there for my teammates and my coaching staff.  That's it.  I mean, at the end of the day, nothing else really matters."
2016-06-13,42:38,41.0,0.533,16.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, it seemed like there was a little bit more action with you off the ball than maybe in Game 4.  You had that nice dunk on the backdoor cut.  I was curious if that was in there and what it does to have you moving off the ball as opposed to just holding it?","Well, I pride myself on not holding the ball as much.  I did that early in my career, and I wasn't very successful.  So I understand how to play efficient basketball. Also, when a guy has it going like Kyrie had it going, I'm able to find cracks and move without the ball and get it with the live dribble and things of that nature.  And all our teammates do a great job of keeping the space, keeping it available for me to cut through the lane and things of that nature.  Just try to be an outlet, an outlet when Kyrie doesn't feel like he has a great look and just try to put pressure on their defense. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, the last two games your efficiency rating is off the charts, and that's something that you pride yourself on.  What's been the key to being so efficient and having back-to-back 41-point games? Le","I give a lot of credit to my teammates and my coaching staff to put me in position to be successful.  I mean, without the ball moving, without the screens being set, without the coaching staff putting out the game plans for us offensively then, what I've been able to do, it doesn't happen.  So those guys definitely get the credit."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, with the turnovers that you had talked about early earlier in the series, you only had two in the last game, only one this game.  Talk about efficiency.  Do you think that's helped with the back-to-back 41-point games? Le","Well, I mean, we know we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They make you pay anytime you make a mistake, and for us to only have 12 turnovers today for 16 points is definitely key to our success. You can't turn the ball over versus anyone in our league, but especially in The Finals versus the defending champions.  You can't do it because they'll make you pay.  So we did a great job of not turning the ball over, including myself, and I just try to put myself in position, put my teammates in position to be successful."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, when you guys are down 3-1, to these guys that are on the left and right of you, what did you see in them or what do you see in them as a player and a person that gave you so much belief that you guys can put yourselves in position to do what you're doing right now? Le","Well, I mean, we just focus on the next game, focus on the next minute, and we focus on the game plan that we had to master up to try to even get to the next play.  And it wasn't even trying to get to a Game 7.  We were like, okay, well, once we went to Game 5, we went out there and being down 3-1, we were like, okay, well, we've got to go home anyway, so let's go home and play in front of our fans, and we were able to do that. And tonight, these guys were, I mean, unbelievable.  Once again, Double T's energy and activity, his level, his rebounding, obviously giving us extra possessions, but his defensive rebounding from the beginning was at an all-time high level for himself, even though as great as he is, he was spectacular tonight.  And Kyrie's just a floor general.  He does what he does.  It's no surprise what he does.  And we put ourselves in position to be able to be in a Game 7."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"You've had obviously you've been in Game 7 in The Finals once before, on your home floor then, of course.  But home, road, one chance to win this championship, will the locale matter to you whatsoever? Le","I'll take it.  It don't matter to me (laughing).  Like I told you guys the other day, it's two of the greatest words in the world, and that's ""Game 7"", so I'll play it anywhere."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,How long did it take for the realization to set in that you have an ultimate game opportunity?  Were you even thinking about it before the clock hit zeros? Le,"No, I'm actually not really thinking about it too much right now.  I'm ready to start my treatment session, get home, getting something to eat, lay down, get ready for the flight tomorrow.  I'm very just chill right now, actually."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, in the second half there was a stretch where you scored or assisted on 27 straight points.  I think you scored 20 of them.  When you get in that mode, do you find something in terms of rhythm within yourself, or is it you finding something the way they're defending you?  Can you just describe what it's like to be like that and playing like that? Le","I'm just out there playing, just reading, reacting.  My teammates, like I said, have put me in position to be successful either when I have the ball or don't have the ball, they give me the ball wherever I would like it.  Setting great screens and trying to put pressure on their defense.  I've been fortunate enough to see the ball go through the hoop the last couple of games.  So, you know, I feel pretty good."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,You've obviously had a long history here in Cleveland.  What would it mean to you to be in the building tonight and see the fans have a game like this? Le,"They deserved it.  They deserved it.  We knew what we were going to get out of them, and now it was up to us to go out and give it back to them, and I think we held up our end of the bargain.  We knew what we were going to get out of those guys, all 20,000-plus.  They were phenomenal from the time we ran out on the floor.  So they deserved tonight, and it was special to be out there for them."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"Do you allow yourself to feel that, the emotion of it being from here? Le","Nope, I don't.  I just play.  I know what I put into the game.  I know how true I am to the game.  I know how true I am to these fans.  So, no, I don't let it get to me."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"People now will say that you and Steph Curry are the two greatest players on the planet, but they don't necessarily determine which one is the best.  You've competed so hard in this series.  You seem to take special delight sometimes in blocking his shot.  Tell me what that's been like to compete against a guy that's sort of vying for that title with you? Le","Oh, I mean, obviously, at the end of the day for me I think -- I don't really get involved in that.  I try to be the best player I can be for this team every night, lead these guys out.  I mean, I actually had a competitive shooting game with my kids last night.  You know, we were shooting baskets last night between myself and my two boys, which ended up not going so well for me at times.  You know, those guys have home-court advantage over me. But at the end of the day my whole mindset is how I can put myself in position to help these guys be successful and I could be successful as well.  I don't really get caught up in what everybody else talks about.  I think you should know me by now.  I see what you're trying to do, though."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, your degree of confidence going into this game, has it changed much from the first time you went for a championship at St. V, when you were in high school? Le","Well, when you're prepared and you're well-prepared, then you have a lot of confidence going into a game.  I was a freshman at St. Mary, we were well prepared.  We had a great high school coach in Keith Dambrot, who is now the head coach at Akron U, who prepared us throughout the whole Playoffs, and then when we got to the state championships.  So we were prepared.  So we went out and just let it happen.  Let it play, and let it play out. Now at this point in my life, sitting here today, we're well prepared with T Lue and our coaching staff.  They prepare us, and it's up to us to go out and play, so we play with a lot of confidence and understanding that it's not -- there's nothing on the court that will blindside us because we're just a prepared bunch."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"Obviously it took a lot from everyone, not just you, to fight back from down 3-1.  I wonder what it's taken just to get to this point, and what's left now for one more game? Le","I guess we just take one day at a time.  We haven't rushed to get to a Game 5.  We didn't rush to get to a Game 6 today.  And we won't rush to get to a Game 7 on Sunday.  At the end of the day this is going to be it for all of us, including you guys.  One more game left, and you guys are going to give it all you've got, we're going to give it all we've got, and the Warriors will do the same, and we'll live with the results.  That's how you go about it. But we won't rush it.  I won't rush it.  I'm going to sleep very well tonight.  I'll sleep very well the following night, watch a couple movies and just get ready to play. KYRIE IRVING: I won't rush it either."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"Ty told us at the beginning of the fourth you said, ""I'm not coming out.""  What is the mental process you use to shut off any physical exhaustion when you know you have to push through the fourth? Le","Well, Klay went on his own barrage for the last three-and-a-half minutes in the third quarter, and we were up 20 at one point and he kind of went on his own 12-0 run or whatever the case may be, just hitting threes, getting to the lane and just kind of took a little bit of momentum from us.  He looked at me and I was like, I just didn't want to come out.  I felt like those first couple minutes of the fourth quarter were going to be very important, and I just wanted to be out there for my teammates and try to make some plays happen, and I was fortunate enough to do that."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"With all the offensive pyrotechnics that you and Kyrie and the statlines you're putting up, getting lost is the defense, four steals, three blocks.  That's become so typical for you and setting the tone for the whole team.  Can you talk about defense?  Because none of us would have imagined holding the Warriors down to 90 points, and things like that almost typically now.  Have you found such a defensive gear here in these Finals? Le","Well, you have to defend, and that's what we've all been talking about since we got together even from last year that in order for us to be ultimately successful, we have to defend, and I mean, if you don't defend versus these guys, you see what happened.  I mean, we've all seen it all year for the last couple years.  If you don't defend these guys or you make a mistake, they make you pay. So our antennas have to be up throughout the course of a 48-minute game on every possession, because as soon as you make a mistake, they get a three here, they get a slip to the rim here.  They get offensive rebound and everyone's in the paint and they seek out to the perimeter for extra threes.  So our antennas just have to be up, and I think it's been there, not every game, not as well as we'd all like, but the last few games our antennas have been razor sharp."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, I want to ask you about your relationship with Coach Lue and how the two of you feed off each other?  How would you compare him with many of the other coaches you've played for? Le","Well, I think all my coaches throughout my career have had a meaningful part of my career.  Everyone's been different in their own ways of how they philosophize the game and things of that nature, but I could talk in the present right now.  I think me and Coach Lue just kind of, we connect that's something that's bigger than basketball, our upbringing.  Being from a single-parent household, being from an inner-city community, being a statistic that you weren't supposed to make it out and there's no way you're going to make it out.  You're going to be another one of those African-American kids, and we both made it out from tough situations growing up, and people just saying there's no way you can do it. So before we even met each other, you have a sense of that type of feeling.  Then I came into the league and I'm a huge basketball fan, obviously, and I watched The Finals when he was with the Lakers and seen the spark that he gave that team when Phil Jackson gave him the nod.  And I think everybody's just so caught up in the shot that AI (Allen Iverson) made when he stepped over him, but people don't realize the impact that he made on that team, and the guy that just accepted his role.  He's able to win a championship. So our relationship has just grown over the years, and just being a competitor, going against him and then seeing him as a coach, going against him again when he was in Boston and things of that nature and with the Clippers, and then when I came back and he was the assistant coach, continues to grow. I think it's like anything, when you're around someone every single day, I guess it's like a marriage or a girlfriend.  You're around her every single day, they get better and better and better if it's genuine, and that's what it is here with myself and T Lue."
2016-06-16,42:35,41.0,0.593,8.0,11.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,"You guys have been working since Labor Day.  Tristan will have played 103 games come Sunday.  When you factor in all the work that's gone on from September through tonight and how his game is predicated upon energy and effort, how impressive or how important is what he's been doing this late in the season? Le","103 consecutive games, correct?  I mean that's phenomenal.  It's a testament to his professionalism as a young guy, him keeping his body not only in shape but understanding that it's more than just playing basketball.  Kid takes care of his body every single day, he's been durable for this franchise even before I even came back. It's a great feeling when you can walk into a building and know that that guy's going to be in uniform.  No matter what's going on, no matter what's happening, you know that guy's going to be in uniform and he's going to give it everything he's got.  It's been great, and 103 on Sunday, and hopefully out of all those games he's played, we want that one to be the best one he's played.  So look forward to it, and I'm done.  Thank you.

2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, first off, congratulations on the win.  So this being your third title, there's obviously a lot of footnotes that separate this, but does this championship resonate with you as being a little bit extra special being that it's for the city of Cleveland, for the state of Ohio where you grew up?","Absolutely.  Just knowing what our city has been through, northeast Ohio has been through, as far as our sports and everything for the last 50-plus years.  You could look back to the Earnest Byner fumble, Elway going 99 yards, to Jose Mesa not being able to close out in the bottom of the ninth to the Cavs went to The Finals -- I was on that team -- in 2007, us getting swept, and then last year us losing 4-2.  And so many more stories. And our fans, they ride or die, no matter what's been going on, no matter the Browns, the Indians, the Cavs and so on, and all other sports teams.  They continue to support us.  And for us to be able to end this, end this drought, our fans deserve it.  They deserve it.  And it was for them."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"I asked you a couple times about that, about the notion of what finally winning one would do for yourself and for the city of Cleveland, and also especially for Akron.  I just wonder, now that you've accomplished it, is it relief?  Is it excitement?  What are the emotions?","Well, I mean, yeah, David, you've been harping on it a lot the last couple weeks.  But for me, I'm true to the game, and I know what I bring to the table.  I came back for a reason.  I came back to bring a championship to our city.  I knew what I was capable of doing.  I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to -- when I came back, I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we've never been.  That's what it was all about. Right now it's just excitement.  It's not even relief.  It's just excitement for us as a team, as a franchise, as a city, as a community.  To be able to continue to build up our city, to continue to be an inspiration to our city, it means everything.  I'm happy to be a part of it."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"At 3-1 with them having two on their record at home, what do you think turned the series around?","For me, when I came up here after we lost Game 4 at home, I said, hey, listen, we've got to take one possession, one game at a time.  We're going to Golden State, so we've got to fly home anyways, so why not have another game? And I believed in that.  And my guys believe in me as their leader every single day.  I preach to them every single day.  I'm their leader, and they allow me to lead those guys every single night.  I was just true to that.  I believed, and nobody else believed besides the other 14 guys and our coaching staff and our fans.  So it's just going out and executing and putting things together and making plays, and we were able to do that."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, when you're sitting on the bench before the game and the National Anthem, you seemed to be deep in thought.  What was really going through your mind at that point?","Just zeroing in on what needs to be done to help us win.  Obviously I put the effort into it, but just thinking about the game, thinking about the plays, understanding that they're going to make a run.  They're a great team.  Understanding that we're going to make some mistakes, but it's how we come back from it and how we move on to the next possession. Then also just living in the moment.  I told my guys before the game:  Listen, there is a game to be played, but there's not many guys, there's not many teams that get an opportunity to be in the NBA Finals in a Game 7.  There's just not. And this is my second one, and I'm able to say that I've been victorious twice in Game 7. I just told the guys:  Don't take this for granted.  Don't take it for granted.  Let's go out.  Our coaching staff gave us a great plan; let's go execute it."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"You guys are losing tears there, J.R. Smith, it's a real genuine scene.  What comes to your mind, all the people that were for you when you were young?  What is happening?","A little bit of everything.  I think all the emotions, everything.  Obviously I know what J.R.'s been through in his career.  People counting him out and saying he's this, he's that, not understanding -- you can't have that.  That's not yours.  That's for Daddy. Just understand what J.R.'s been through and people just saying that there's no way he can be a winner.  When our GM came to us last year and said, hey, we've got a deal to get Timofey Mozgov and get Iman Shumpert, and the Knicks are going to throw in J.R., I was like, what?  They're going to throw in J.R. into the deal?  And I was like, okay, I've got him.  I got him. And J.R. turned himself into not only a huge boost to our team, but he turned himself into a two-way player, both sides of the floor.  And I think those emotions came out of J.R. at the end of those games.  Those emotions came out of me, just leading 14 guys and understanding, like I said, what our city's been through over the last 50-plus years since Jim Brown.  Then also people just counting me out.  Throughout my 13-year career, I've done nothing but be true to the game, give everything I've got to the game, put my heart, my blood, sweat, tears into the game, and people still want to doubt what I'm capable of doing. So that was a little icing on the cake for myself to just let me know that everything I've done, it results in this.  They say hard work pays off, and that's what happened tonight."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"LeBron, what is it about the athlete's mind or your mind that you don't feel that 3-1 is insurmountable especially against this team and you've got to win two here?  Then the last three games, the fire that you maybe played -- or were you fueled by anything that happened between you and Draymond, in Klay's words, to give you extra fire in these three games?","Well, I mean, at the end of the day you're down 3-1, and we've got to come here.  We've got to come here and win.  We had to win in this building anyways.  I mean, we only get three games at home.  So even if we sweep the home series in a seven-game series, we've got to win here anyway. So Game 5 was a great opportunity for us to try to seize that, and we came up with a great game plan.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and we were able to send the game back home down 3-2. And we know our fans.  Our fans give us everything, and we were able to give it back to them.  Once we get to a Game 7, I'll take my chances versus anybody, versus any team.  You give me one game, you give me 48 minutes, I'll take my chances.  Once we got to a Game 7, I was just confident.  I knew what I was capable of doing.  I knew my guys would allow me to lead them throughout the 48 minutes, and they did that."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"Your story is a bit like a Greek drama.  You come to the Cavaliers a home-grown product, you leave, you come back saying that you want to win for the city.  Can you talk about what you want to tell the Cleveland fans, the ones that got mad at you, the ones who never got mad at you?  And also right now you're an emotional person.  What is going through your heart and mind right now?","What's going through my mind is I'm ready to get back to Cleveland.  I can't wait to get off that plane and hold that trophy up and see all our fans at the terminal, IX Jet Center, and I know they're going to be ready.  So I can't wait to give the emotion back to them.  I'm looking forward to it.  That's all."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"What message do you have for fans there right now who are watching who are very happy?  And, again, the ones who were upset with you, the ones who were never upset with you?",That don't matter.  That's yesterday's newspaper.  I don't think anybody's reading yesterday's newspaper.  They'll be reading tomorrow that I'm coming home.  I'm coming home with what I said I was going to do.
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,Can you even fathom what that parade's going to be like on Wednesday?,"Oh, my goodness.  It's going to be probably one of the biggest parties -- I'm sorry, one of?  It's going to be the biggest party that Cleveland has ever seen ever.  So if you guys still have a little money left over in your budget, you guys better make a trip to Cleveland and get a little piece of it."
2016-06-19,46:49,27.0,0.375,11.0,11.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,"I spoke to the people around the team leading up to Game 7, and several people told me there is just a sense of calm emanating from you.  What put you in that mind space?","I don't know.  I don't know.  I can sit up here and say -- I don't know if it was ""The Godfather,"" I don't know if it was ""Couples Retreat"" that I watched, I don't know if it was ""Ocean's 11, 12, and 13,"" I don't know if it was the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" that I watched.  I really don't know. But I was just so like, listen, you've put everything into the game.  The game always gives back to people that's true to the game.  I've watched it.  I know the history of the game, and I was just calm.  I was calm.  I was focused.  I was locked in. I don't know.  I wish I could tell you exactly what happened, but I had to be calm in order for my 14 guys to allow me to lead them and for those guys to play the way they played. I mean, I can't do it by myself, so that was my mindset.  I was confident.  I was calm.  You've got to stay low.  Like Jay-Z said, you've got to stay low and keep firing, and that's exactly what I did."

2017-05-17,41:58,38.0,0.583,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,Right now would you say this is the most comfortable you've felt in your entire career? Le,"It's too hard to say.  Just trying to make plays for myself, make plays for my teammates, keep the defense off balance throughout the course of a 48-minute game.  The coaching staff and my teammates do a great job of putting me in a position to succeed, and I just try to come through for them every night. Tonight was another one of those games where I made a couple plays to help us get a win.  But it was definitely our two bigs that set the tone.  Kev [Love] and Double T [Tristan Thompson], they were phenomenal."
2017-05-17,41:58,38.0,0.583,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, by my count they put about eight different defenders on you.  When you're having success no matter who they're putting on you, do you think that does anything for you momentum-wise or does it defeat them when they're trying so many different options and none of them are working? Le","I don't think it's no momentum.  I pretty much know how many guys I'm going to see throughout the course of a game.  I know the guy that's going to start on me.  I know the guy that's going to shift off onto me if a sub happens or if they go small or if they go big.  For me, the only thing on my mind is how we can execute the best way we can and get a bucket in this possession, either if I can get myself a shot or if I can drive, get my shooters a shot, or if I can get a double-team in the paint or get to the free throw line. It's not an individual matchup for me, no matter who's in front of me.  My mind is always racing on how I can make this the best possession at that particular time."
2017-05-17,41:58,38.0,0.583,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, I know you study the game the way you do; are you setting up Kevin to get the best out of him from perhaps back to his Minnesota days?  And Kevin, is this as good as you've felt in terms of your comfort zone, year three with the team? Le","Well, for me I saw that in Kev this morning.  I knew what type of game he was going to have.  I mean, he came through for us.  We want the mentality of Kevin from Minnesota, but his usage rate don't have to be as high as Minnesota.  Obviously we all know that he was a featured guy pretty much every possession going down the floor, and here that's changed a little bit because we have other guys.  But his mentality needs to stay the same as Minnesota, and I think as he continues to get even more comfortable and comfortable -- tonight was one of those instances where every time he got the ball, it was a small guarding him or somebody was in the post, he was aggressive.  He grabbed every rebound for the most part with him and Tristan in the paint, and he was very aggressive with his shot.  He also got to the free throw line 10 times -- well, nine.  So definitely that mentality from Minnesota is what we all love."

Le","We put in a lot of work.  We put in a lot of work.  Coach gave us a couple days off after we closed the series in Toronto, but after that we've been on the practice court or in the weight room training as if we were playing. There's no way you can substitute a game.  We all know that.  But the work that we put in this week, we just tried to be as up to speed as possible when the game did come.  Tonight was just another opportunity for us to implement our scheme.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and it was up to us to go out and execute it."
2017-05-17,41:58,38.0,0.583,9.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you've had a lot of playoff moments here in this building, some great moments for you, some disappointments, as well.  There seemed to be a relentlessness or a ruthlessness in your game and in your approach tonight.  Is that for you?  Is that for your teammates?  Or is that for the opponent? Le","Well, I think it's the mindset that you have to have when you go on the road for a Game 1.  You can't start the game off lax or shooting a bunch of jump shots.  That's my mindset.  We've got guys that can shoot the heck out of a ball, and obviously Kev showed that tonight.  But for myself, I have to be in attack mode and just put the pressure on the defense and see what happens.  I was able to do that and kind of just set the tone early on what we needed to do.  Once I started to see the defense start to crack in, then I started to find my shooters. I don't even think we played that great tonight.  We definitely didn't shoot the ball as well as we're capable of shooting.  I know Kyle had three or four very, very good looks that he missed when we had a good stretch.  But I think the energy and the effort and the mindset was where it needed to be starting on the road, especially in the Eastern Conference Finals."

I'm wondering if you saw those results, that you were not in the top three, and if that fed into the game at all, and whether or not you even saw your reaction to not being in the top three. Le","No, I didn't see it.  And what are you going to do about it at the end of the day?  My only job is to try to be the MVP for this team every night, put my teammates, put our franchise in position to be successful and ultimately compete for a championship.  For me, I know what I bring to the table.  This league knows what I bring to the table.  That's for you guys to write about.  It's not for me to be concerned about."

What are you seeing from your team now, 10 straight?  And obviously tonight's game was what it was.  Where do you see this team right now? Le","We just want to try to get better.  I also told you we had another level.  You looked at me crazy when I told you that.  I believe we've got another level as well.  As well as we played tonight, there were still some things we could have done better.  We had a few bad turnovers offensively that we could do better.  We had a couple miscues defensively where we gave up some open looks. We can get better.  That's the positive for our ballclub.  There's no complacency with us right now.  There shouldn't be.  It's the postseason.  But we like where we're headed and the direction we're headed right now."
2017-05-19,32:48,30.0,0.667,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,Even before the series started Brad Stevens said that he felt like the Cavs had a perfect roster.  What do you feel about the roster composition and the pieces that you have and what you are potentially able to accomplish with them? Le,"Well, that's a huge compliment, but there's no such thing for us.  We don't have a perfect roster.  We don't have a perfect team.  But we can make up for mistakes, and we can make up for maybe some deficiencies that we may have because we communicate, we fly around and we sacrifice for one another.  That could put us as close to perfection as possible, which you can't ever get to.  But our communication level, our sacrifice, what we give to each other every night kind of covers that, kind of covers some of the faults that we may have.  And with the faults that we do have, we try to get better and better at it so we can be as great as we can be every single night."
2017-05-19,32:48,30.0,0.667,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,"You said this team had another level, but now you've won 13 straight games in the postseason.  Is this the highest level that you've played offensively in your career? Le","I don't know.  I'm a guy who lives in the moment.  Our team is in a great groove, and I'm happy to be a part of that groove.  At the end of the day, we want to try to put ourselves in position to win every game.  That's the goal.  Can you do that?  Sometimes you come out with an L, but it's how you learn from those experiences that's going to help you out the next time.  We are in a good groove as a team, and we want to try to continue that going home."
2017-05-19,32:48,30.0,0.667,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,Isaiah sat out the second half.  Brad told us before you came out here that he's been dealing with an injury since last week.  Can you sense something physically different with him throughout these first two games? Le,"No, I don't really pay attention to those things, to be honest.  I only pay attention to what's going on with our guys and how we can put a lot of pressure on the opposing team, from IT to the rest of those guys.  Obviously we didn't see him in the second half.  Marcus Smart started the second half, but that was not our concern going into the second half.  Our concern was not get complacent.  Don't do what we did in Game 1 in the third quarter here, where we gave up I think 36 or something points in that quarter.  Don't allow them to get into a good groove. It's not my concern."
2017-05-19,32:48,30.0,0.667,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,Do you feel like with your physical perimeter defense you guys have kind of pushed them out of their comfortable game plan and put their backs against the wall? Le,"Well, they're going to make another adjustment, and we have to be ready for that going into Game 3.  We're going to watch film tomorrow and see ways we can be better.  We do have some great perimeter defenders that take the challenge, but we also have great third-line defense as well with our front line, which communicates pick-and-roll coverages or pin-down coverages or whatever coverages and allow the guards to get up into the ball or do what they need to do to be successful versus their guards."
2017-05-19,32:48,30.0,0.667,4.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,"Brad was saying one of the takeaways he took from the game was in the beginning of the fourth quarter Kyle [Korver] and a bunch of the veterans were out there playing so professionally.  Are you guys at a point where you're challenging each other, excellent veterans making each other better? Le","Absolutely.  We have a veteran ballclub.  We're one of the oldest teams in the league, so we all push each other.  We're here for one reason.  When you sign up to be here, we're here to compete.  We're here to sacrifice for one another.  And if you're in garbage time or if you're in in crunch time, you need to be a professional.  RJ [Richard Jefferson] has done that.  Champ [James Jones] has done that.   Channing [Frye] is doing that.  You see guys playing one round, a huge piece for one round, but then the next round certain things change.  Guys just continue to stay ready.  Guys continue to stay professional. It's great to be in a locker room like that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,You guys were up 21 points.  What happened?  What factors led to Boston coming back at you? Le,"Momentum.  We didn't continue to press the tempo.  Marcus Smart started to hit a lot of threes.  They started to get momentum, and that's what happens -- you give a team a life.  They played so freely without IT, and they just made play after play after play, and we couldn't weather the storm."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,You had a tough second half with just three points.  What were some of the factors that led to that?  Were you as aggressive as you wanted to be? Le,"I had a tough game, period.  Not just in the second half.  Me personally, I didn't have it.  My teammates did a great job of keeping us in the game, building that lead.  But me personally, I didn't have it.  That's all I've got to say about my performance."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"Was there a sense of surprise or shock or what have you in the locker room afterward, just given how well the first two games had gone and that Isaiah was out? Le","No, it's never that.  We've been playing so well, but like I said, you let a team grab momentum like that, you almost knew that that last shot was going to go in.  It was like, you already knew.  As soon as the ball went out his hands, you kind of knew that shot was going to go in because of how the game was just played throughout the second half."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,Did they mix up the coverage on you from what you had seen in the first two games? Le,"No, no, they didn't mix up the coverage.  They did a good job of sprinting back, leveling to the ball, doubling me a little bit more in the post.  But like I said, my performance personally was all on me."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, kind of off that, defensively, what went wrong in that end of the third quarter through the end of the fourth quarter defensively? Le","I mean, a lot of things went wrong.  I don't know; I can't play the game right back in my head right now, and I'm looking forward to seeing the film tomorrow when we get together.  But they moved the ball, like Double-T said -- 28 assists -- and they kept us at bay.  We couldn't get stops.  We couldn't get out in transition a lot.  Those guys made plays.  They made a lot of plays.  They got some second-chance points.  We only had two fast-break points, so they neutralized what we wanted to do."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"You said your game, couldn't get into a rhythm tonight.  Is that what it was based on their defense or just not feeling it or what? Le","No, I was just pretty poor.  I mean, what do you want me to say?"
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, what do you take from this game going forward into Tuesday night? Le","Well, we're going to crack down on the film tomorrow, for sure.  We've got to be a lot better.  It's the postseason.  You win some, you lose a couple, maybe, but how can you be better from game to game?  And like I said, they was better today than we were, and we've got to figure out how to be better than them in Game 4.  But we look forward to the challenge.  I think it's great -- what happened hurts.  It's a loss in the postseason.  But I'm glad it kind of hurt, that it happened the way it did -- let our foot off the gas a little bit, didn't keep the pressure on them like we have been accustomed to.  But we have to play a lot better in Game 4."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,"LeBron, the Celtics scored seven points on ATOs in the final minute.  What makes this team harder than almost any team in the league trying to stop them -- Le","I said that before the series even started about Brad Stevens' ATOs.  If you go back and look at my transcript, I said he's very good out of ATOs.  He has so many different wrinkles, misdirection, thinking the ball is going this way, he has a misdirection going the other way.  You've got to kind of keep your head on a swivel.  He has a lot of packages.  So you can plan for a few, but then he might run something you've never seen before.  If we communicate a little bit better out of timeouts, it'll put us in position to be more successful against that."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,Coach Lue pretty kind of pinned it on the fourth-quarter turnovers.  Was that more your lack of concentration or their hustle? Le,"A little bit of both.  A little bit of carelessness.  I had one when Kev ducked in, I should have faked high, bounced low.  But I just threw it, and that lets me know I didn't have it tonight.  Jae Crowder got his hands on it.  We had a couple more turnovers where we just were either overpassing or overthinking or whatever the case may be.  That definitely resulted in us not being as fluent as we've been offensively."
2017-05-21,45:03,11.0,0.308,6.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0,What did you mean a minute ago when you said you were kind of glad it happened the way that it did? Le,"Well, I feel some adversity is all part of the postseason.  I feel like you have to have some type of adversity in order to be successful.  If it was going to happen, let it happen now; let us regroup.  Let us regroup and all the narrative and everything that was going on, let's regroup and let's get back to playing desperate basketball, which they did tonight.  So we've got to be a lot better, for sure. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

What did he show you and the world tonight? Le","Nothing.  Same thing I've been saying since I got here.  I've been saying he's a special kid.  He's a special talent.  As the stakes get higher and higher, his game gets higher and higher, but it was nothing surprising for me.  But he rose to the occasion, and he put the team on his back, and we definitely needed that effort from him.  Like he said, he's been just kind of dictating the game and being a playmaker and things of that nature throughout the Playoffs or even throughout this series so far, but tonight, he showed why he's one of the best point guards in the league, and he commanded us to be better, especially in the second half."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,"When the Celtics were switching on you in the fourth quarter, what were you seeing? Le","Just trying to be aggressive.  Obviously I couldn't be as aggressive as in the first half because of the foul trouble, so if I'm on the floor I've got to be aggressive and try to make plays, help our team be successful and read the defense.  I was able to still be aggressive and find two of our shooters for two threes, found Kev, found Swish [JR Smith], so it was just trying to read the game, the game in between the game, and it worked well for us."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,"Fourth quarter it seemed like it all came back to you scoring the ball and shooting the ball over kind of a difficult stretch.  Is that just kind of a thawing out thing, you're through that stretch, and return to the player, the shooter that you were the previous 10 games, or is it something you just kind of had to fight through? Le","Yeah, my rhythm for the most part is broken when you -- I can't remember the last -- I don't think I've ever had four fouls in a game before in the first half, so my rhythm is kind of broken and you've got to figure out ways you can still help the team, and my teammates said be aggressive, be you.  You got us to this point and continue to do that, so I just tried to find ways to get into the lane, get into transition, when they backed off shoot the jumper and felt very comfortable with it, so I was able to get back into a rhythm very fast."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,By the same token do you feel as a team that you've kind of recovered now that you've got to go back to Boston for Game 5? Le,"At the end of the day, you play the game that's in front of you.  We didn't take care of business in Game 3, they played well.  Tonight they played well again, but we was able to play well, especially in the second half, and we defended.  If we defend, then we're going to always give ourselves a good chance to win.  We look forward to the next game.  It's a difficult challenge because our preparation going into the series was going against a team with Isaiah, so now they're playing a lot differently now, so we're trying to figure out exactly what they're running and things of that nature, so it's been very difficult on us without IT on the floor, but now this is two games that we've been able to see them and we're going to get a better understanding.  We should be a lot better in Game 5."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,I was going to ask about that exactly.  Do you feel like the second half was evidence of you guys starting to understand exactly what it was they were trying to do without Isaiah now that he's not there? Le,"Yeah, like I say, we game planned -- because their series went to [Game] 7 we game planned for both teams, and they're a different team when IT is -- I won't say a different team, they run different things just because of IT being a huge piece of the puzzle for them offensively.  So they had to kind of reshape, and that's the beauty of having Brad Stevens as your coach.  You're able to reshape what you do offensively and still be in a good rhythm.  It's been challenging for us to kind of -- plays out of time-out, kind of been killing us on ATOs and keeping us off balance, but in the second half we kind of got a little bit of rhythm, and think we'll be better in Game 5."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,They kind of caught you in a momentum shift in the second half last game.  Did they almost show you a little bit more in this one because you guys knew what was coming out? Le,"No, I mean, listen, they're well-coached, and they've got guys that's always kind of been counted out throughout their career, so they play with a lot of pride.  And then you add the green on their back and this is history, this is a franchise that you kind of no matter who's out on the floor, you have to play for that franchise and play with pride.  You know, they're giving us everything that they have, and we're expecting it, and we want the challenge.  It's the postseason.  At the end of the day, you just want to win the game.  It doesn't matter who you're going against or how you get the job done, you're just trying to figure it out, and I think we did that."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,"In your career kind of looking back, have you ever seen a player get double and triple boxed on rebounding opportunities as much as Tristan has, and how big was Kevin's rebounding in addition to that just given the way that they are defending him on the glass? Le","Yeah, I mean, when you look at some of the greatest rebounders in our game, guys who create extra possessions, you've got to figure out a way to try to take him out, and not take him out like in a bad way, but how do you keep him off the glass, and they're doing a really good job the last couple games of putting two or three bodies on him.  But when you do that, you allow our other frontcourt player who's been a monster rebounder his whole career to come up and do the thing that he did tonight, and we needed that.  We needed the 17 rebounds from Kev, and it was huge for our team."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,You mentioned you've never had four fouls in a game.  Have you ever missed a dunk like that in a game? Le,I have.  I have.  I think I missed one in Boston before.  I've missed a couple drunks in my career.  I think I've made more than I've missed though.  Percentages are pretty good.  (Laughter).

Le",When I came into the league or my first seven seasons in the NBA?
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,"Right, your first seven seasons, yeah, exactly. Le","I mean, the kid is special, and he basically was just waiting for an opportunity to be able to blossom, and I'm just happy and blessed that when I decided to come back that I was able to help him blossom, I guess, because he gets to play in games that he's always been built for.  He just never had the opportunity because of the team at that point in time.  With me coming back and we're getting Kev and making a trade for J.R. and T-Mo [Timofey Mozgov] and Shump and all the pieces and all the pieces started coming together and Double T [Tristan Thompson] gets better and Delly [Matthew Dellavedova] and all that, and in year 1, even though it wasn't the successful season we would have hoped for, it gave him some experience that he didn't have in his first -- I don't know what he had, four seasons before I got here, that he didn't have.  But he was already built for it.  His game was built for it, and I'm happy, like I said, to be able to, I guess, sit back with four fouls and see him do what he's always been built to do.  He was born for these moments."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,How much did the defense help trigger that 40-point third quarter you guys as a team collectively on defense? Le,"Well, in order to be successful, you have to defend.  You have to defend.  And especially versus a team like this who moves the ball, shares the ball, moves bodies, and they're very precise with their offensive sets.  You have to defend, and it allows us to get to our best attribute at times and that's to get out on the open floor.  I think that allowed us to outscore them by 17 in the third."
2017-05-23,38:16,34.0,0.556,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1,"The sense I got from Boston fans when I left there, they didn't really feel like they'd be coming back, that you guys would come back.  How difficult will it be to close them out with a chance to go to The Finals again? Le","Well, it's all -- the close-out game is always the hardest, and also you're doing it, and Boston is going to make it even harder.  We have to go in with a bunker mentality that we had in Game 1 and Game 2 to go out and do what we do, but we have to defend.  We have to execute offensively.  We have to have low turnovers, and we have to try to make them miss because some of those guys play a lot better at home.  That's just how the game be played.  But we'll play the game, and we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

It's the first time I've seen him since he didn't return for the second half in Game 2, I believe.  Yeah, Game 2.  Throughout the series we didn't get an opportunity to actually have that moment.  I know I said a few things in the media about the situation he was going through, but I was happy to see him.  Just give him a big hug from myself and my family.  Just how tough and determined the guy is, and to be able to go through the situation he was going through on a day-to-day basis, still being focused and maintaining his focus for the team -- family is everything, and basketball comes second after family, and to see him perform the way he was performing throughout the playoffs under the circumstances was a treat to watch.  A lot more words were said, but that's the gist of it."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, given how far the Celtics made it this season and that they also own the No. 1 pick, how likely do you think it is that you'll see them in a rematch next year in this series? Le",I don't know.  That's a question that none of us can answer in here.  They have a great team right now.  IT is going to come back healthy.  They have the No. 1 pick; we'll see what they do with that.  But I can't answer that question and know if we're going to play them in the Eastern Conference Finals next year.  I have no idea.

None of these things have ever happened before.  What do you pick to think about? Le","I think the first thing for me was seeing the excitement on Kyle [Korver's] and Deron [Williams] face.  You've got one guy with 12 years, first Finals appearance, and another guy 14.  So that's the first thing I picked.  And just to see the excitement around my teammates -- I do it for them, and they give it back to me as well."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"Going back to those guys who haven't been to The Finals, what's the message to them as they get ready for this journey? Le","Well, I don't have a message right now because we need to live in the moment.  Like I said, it's been 12 and 14 years for those two guys.  So we all need to soak it up.  This is a great moment, and this is not promised.  We know that.  But once we start to lock in on that beast of a matchup that we've got next round, then we'll be very focused and I'll let those guys know what to expect out of a Finals appearance."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"Richard Jefferson said in the locker room today, he was asked about you breaking MJ's record, and he said, I can go on record and say that when LeBron James is done playing, his records will never be broken.  Just your thoughts on hearing that from RJ, one of your teammates. Le","Well, I love the fact that RJ does that because we have a great partnership, Uninterrupted, and Road Trippin' is doing very well now.  So it's a huge plug for my business and our partnership.  Thank you, RJ.  You're unbelievable."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, from the number that you wear on your jersey to just the way people have talked about this one guy, that he's such a luminary in the game and you're trying to chase it, how do you put into words passing Michael in such a statistic that has a lot of stature in this game? Le","First of all, I wear the number because of Mike.  I think I fell in love with the game because of Mike, just seeing what he was able to accomplish.  When you're growing up and you're seeing Michael Jordan, it's almost like a god.  So I didn't ever believe I could be Mike.  I started to focus on myself on other players and other people around my neighborhood because I never thought that you could get to a point where Mike was. So I think that helped shape my game.  I think the biggest thing for me sitting here today after breaking the all-time scoring record in playoff history is that I did it just being me.  I don't have to score the ball to make an impact in the basketball game.  That was my mindset when I started playing the game.  I was like, if I'm not scoring the ball, how can I still make an impact on the game?  It's carried me all the way to this point now, and it's going to carry me for the rest of my career because scoring is not No. 1 on my agenda."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"LeBron, I heard what you said about living in the moment, but is there a particular challenge about defending the title against these guys? Le","I'm going to be honest, I'm not in the right mind to even talk about Golden State.  It's too stressful, and I'm not stressed right now.  I'm very happy about our accomplishment.  I have no discussion -- Golden State, they've been the best team in our league for the last three years, and then they added an MVP.  That's all I can give you right now, because I'm happy and I don't want to be stressed.  They cause a lot of stress, and I'll get to that point when we start to prepare for them."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,You've said multiple times now that growing up you never thought you could reach Michael's status.  When did you realize you could? Le,I don't -- have I?
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"You're on the green, if you're not. Le","I'm not a golfer.  This guy right here to my left [J.R. Smith] is, though, so he'll tell me what that means when we get on the bus. J.R. SMITH: He drove the green, I'll tell you that."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"But you're obviously in the discussion.  It's a barbershop debate, but you're in that discussion.  When did you realize you could be? Le","I think at the end of the day, for my name to come up in the discussion with the greatest basketball player of all time, it's like, wow.  Like I said, I did pretty much everything that MJ did when I was a kid.  I shot fadeaways before I should have.  I wore a leg sleeve on my leg and folded it down so you saw the red part.  I wore black and red shoes with white socks.  I wore short shorts so you could see my undershorts underneath.  I didn't go bald like Mike, but I'm getting there.  (Laughter).  But it will be post-career, though.  That's the only thing I didn't do.  But other than that, I did everything Mike did.  I even wore a wristband on my forearm.  I didn't do the hoop earring, either.  That was Mike.  But I did everything Mike did, man. I wanted to be Mike, so for my name to come up in any discussion with Michael Jordan or Kareem or all these guys that's paved the ways for Tristan and Kevin [on podium with James] and myself and Swish [J.R. Smith], it's a wow factor.  I don't really have anything to say."
2017-05-25,34:44,35.0,0.722,8.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,"You said that trying to be like Mike was impossible because he's like a god, but what would it mean for you to kids now to say they want to be like LeBron? Le","That's all part of the plan.  It's been part of the plan since I really started taking this game serious, to say how can I get the youth to feel like passing the ball is OK, making the extra pass is OK, drawing two defenders and no matter if you win or lose, if you make the right play, it's OK.  Because like you said, scoring the ball is so heralded in our sport.  I want the fundamentals of the game to be as great as they can be.  And if some kid or a group of kids from the West Coast or the East Coast or the Midwest or the South and everything in between all around the world can look at me and say, well, I made the extra pass because LeBron made the extra pass, or I got a chase-down block and I didn't give up on the play because LeBron didn't give up, that would mean the world to me. So we'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  Appreciate it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"From your perspective, what went wrong in that third period?  The game was still within reach, and then they broke it open late in the third.","And that's -- it wasn't just the third quarter, it was the whole game.  It started with myself having some turnovers, especially in the first half.  I pride myself on not turning the ball over, and I did it too much. So 20 turnovers for 21 points on the road and 56 points in the paint, we did a great job of covering the 3-point line, but other than that, they played a hell of a game."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"One follow-up with that, so much was made about the time off for both teams, any prospect of rust being a factor?","No, I don't think so.  But I also know that you cannot simulate what they bring to the table.  No matter how many days that you have to prepare, you can't simulate what they have.  So it's great to get the first game up underneath us.  We made a lot of mistakes; they capitalized.  And we get an opportunity to get a couple days to see what they did and see what we did wrong and how we can be better in Game 2."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"If there was one thing that stands out to you about them, whether it's speed or whatever, what would it -- what was it for tonight?",K.D.
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"He just -- obviously he hasn't been here in the last two Finals.  I mean, what is it about him?  What kind of impact does he make?  How does he change things?","I mean, you take one of the best teams that we had ever assembled last year, that we saw in the regular season and in the post-season, and then in the off-season you add a high-powered offensive talent like that and a great basketball IQ like that, that's what stands out. I mean, it's no if, ands, or buts.  It is what it is.  We got to figure out how to combat that, which is going to be a tough challenge for us.  But that's what stands out."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"Doc Rivers said that the Warriors have this penchant for making teams almost concentrate too much on the three.  You start to get it in your head that you need to prevent them from 3-pointers, and then the inside opens up.  Were you guys victims of that tonight, did you feel that?","No, we was victims of ourself, for one.  Like I said, we had 20 turnovers, and there's no way you're going to win a ball game having 20 turnovers against this team and on the road.  But at the end of the day, we gave up a lot in transition.  They had 27 points on fast breaks."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"Follow-up, Kyrie and you got into a lot of isolation situations.  Do you feel like the ball needs to move a little more?","That's part of our game.  That's part of our game.  It's what got us here.  So we definitely want to be more in the 20s in assists, but that's what got us here.  And we got to be able to make shots.  We got to be able to move the ball.  We know that.  But playing iso ball has helped us get to this point, and it has gave us success in the last three years.  So we don't want to have a high steady diet of it because the defense becomes stagnant and our players become stagnant, but that's part of our package."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"When your offense isn't flowing the way that you're used to and you're turning the ball over the way that you were tonight, what can be done, if anything, to not allow that to carry over to the defensive end?","Well, I think that -- I mean, a couple instances.  First of all, we got to stop the ball in transition.  There was a few times where we fanned out to the 3-point line and let guys just go right down the middle for a dunk.  And I know, I believe, K.D. had two or three of those.  So when you turn the ball over, you got to know that that's their best.  That's when they become very dangerous because those guys, they sprint down the lane, they sprint to the 3-point line, they put a lot of pressure on your defense. But the ball is the number one thing.  We got to stop the ball first and then fan out to the 3-point line if those guys go there."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,Were you surprised how many times the Warriors drove in and got to the rim tonight?,"No, I wasn't surprised at anything.  They are a high-powered offensive team.  They can shoot the ball from the perimeter, they can get into the paint.  They do everything exceptionally well, if not great.  So never surprised by anything that they can do."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"As a leader, what is your message to your teammates after a bad lost like this?","Just get focused on Game 2.  We made a lot of mistakes.  There's nothing really needs to be said.  We know we're capable of playing a lot better.  We didn't play as well as we know we're capable of, so we look forward to the next one."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"Tristan seemed to have a tough night.  A bunch of guys had a tough night.  Outside of you, Kyrie, and Kevin, what do you need from the complementary players in this series?  What do you need out of them?","Just to be themselves and do what they have done throughout the course of the season, throughout the course of the last couple years.  Play with energy, play with effort, play with their mind and their bodies and understand what we're trying to accomplish. So it's going to be -- this is The Finals, and we don't care about making mistakes, just play as hard as you can and follow the game plan, have your mind in it.  And if your mind is fresh and your mind is into it, then a lot of things take care of itself."
2017-06-01,40:02,28.0,0.45,15.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0,"First quarter you had eight free throws, you had four the rest of the game.  Do you feel like you could have been doing more driving to the hole?  It's one of your strengths, obviously.","Well, the game is -- I mean, it's played how it's played.  I don't know.  I mean, first half I had six turnovers, second half I had two.  So could I have turned the ball over more in the second half?  I mean, the game is just -- the game is just played that way.

I'll figure it out within the next 48 hours.  Obviously it's a dramatic situation to be in, but it is what it is and we got to get ready for Game 4. So we're going to come in tomorrow, watch some film, see ways we can get better and just try to take it one game at a time."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,You guys were up six with 3:09 to go.  What stands out to you in the remaining three minutes after that?,"They made some shots and we didn't.  We had some really good looks.  We had some really good looks.  I had a turnaround jumper in the post fade-away, I make a ton, didn't go in.  Kyle had a corner three, really good look, right in front of their bench, didn't go in.  They came down and Steph, one ricocheted off the backboard, he got a tip in, K.D. got a pull-up on Tristan, and then he shoots a bomb in transition. So it's a miss-or-make league.  We make a couple, they miss a couple, and it's the other way around.  But it didn't happen that way."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Last year you guys did something that was never done before in the NBA Finals, coming back from 3-1.  Now you have an opportunity to do that again.  Does that give you some confidence, give the team some confidence that, hey, it was something last year that they thought was impossible, now obviously a lot of people are going to be like this is impossible?","Well, of course, but for me personally I don't get involved in what people talk about.  That's not -- I've been out of that department I told you guys for a long time now.  So mentally, me personally, I got to go home, start my treatment right now, get my mind focused and get my body focused and get my body ready for Game 4, and we take it one possession at a time."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Steve Kerr was saying after the game that he felt he kept telling his team, Kyrie and LeBron will get tired, they can't play one-on-one for 45 minutes.  Was fatigue in your mind a factor in the late game execution?","No, only missed shots.  We missed shots.  I gave everything that I had, so at times throughout the game I was tired, but that's just because I was just playing as hard as I could.  But I was able to get second and third and fourth winds.  I don't contribute as losing this game because we got tired.  We missed some shots, and they made some."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Also, can you talk about your mindset when Kevin came up the court with about 40 seconds left to go and he paused at the three-point line when you were defending him?",What do you mean my mindset?
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,What were you looking to do in that situation?  What were you thinking he was going to do?,"Well, I seen him getting ready to pull up, he uses a rhythm dribble to get a good look, and when K.D. shoots, he falls forward, and I wanted to get a contest.  The last thing I want to do is foul a jump shooter.  So I wanted to jump and contest it, but I know he -- when he shoots, he kind of leans forward a little bit.  So I just stayed there, high hands, contested, and he made it."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Did you guys -- throughout that game, were you convinced you were going to win it, or did you feel like you were in control of it?","Of course we thought we was going to win.  That's just -- we had an opportunity.  They had opportunities as well.  And they made the most of them, and we didn't.  So, yeah, we came in the game believing we was going to win for sure."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"I'm saying as the game went on, when you looked around, the shots you were making, the way your guys were playing?","We were playing good basketball.  Kyrie got it going, JR got it going as well, so we had some really good looks, like I said.  I can't go back and think of it right now exactly all the possessions that we had in the fourth quarter, but we had some good looks."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,You had 39-11-9 and Kyrie had 38 and 6.  Does that constitute as your best shot?  Did the Warriors take your best shot tonight?,"I mean, it's so hard to say, but like I said, for me personally, I gave everything I had tonight.  So win, lose, or draw, you live with the results.  Like I said, they played a really good game as well, but they made shots, they made shot down the stretch.  They got stops, which they have been doing.  We shot in the low 40s again.  They got stops and then they made play after play down the stretch."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"They withstand that from you guys tonight, Game 2 they turn it over 20 times and still win.  I mean, can you wrap your head around what kind of team you're dealing with here in the Warriors?","Yeah, I mean, before the series even started we knew what we was dealing with.  I said it after we won the Eastern Conference Finals that we're getting ready for a juggernaut.  It's probably the most, most firepower I've played in my career.  I played against some great teams, but I don't think no team has had this type of firepower. So even when you're playing well, you got to play like A plus plus, because they're going to make runs and they're going to make shots and they got guys that's going to make plays.  So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ball game, but they made a couple more."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Along those lines, LeBron, you have faced a lot of great teams in The Finals over the years.  When there's so little room for error against this team, how physically and emotionally draining is that on you?","On me personally, I mean, obviously it's physically and emotionally draining because I give everything to the game and want to put myself and my teammates in a position to be successful.  So but I lay it all on the floor, and I did that tonight, gave everything that I had, both mentally and physically.  So obviously I'm drained right now, ready to get home.  But you're going against a team like this and you put together a game like we had where we had an opportunity, it's definitely draining."
2017-06-07,45:37,39.0,0.556,11.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Will you look back at the game and think if there is more minutes I do play, if there's more I can do?","No.  No, I did, like I said, I gave everything that I had to this game, so I don't look at it saying I wish I could have did this or I would have did that.  I left it out on the floor. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Just wondering if you could take us through kind of what was going through your head and how the play developed, the one where you went off the glass yourself.","I think I was -- it was a transition play, and I believe it was Kyle on my right side that was running the wing, and two of their players were back and I was just trying to engage one of them so I could get Kyle a shot in the corner, and they both went to Kyle, I believe, and I got caught in the air.  So that's the only thing I could think of.  I didn't want to travel, and Draymond was kind of playing Double T, and Double T kind of had his back towards me, so I just threw it off the glass and went and got it."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"The way you guys came out in that first quarter where Tristan is establishing the tone of the game, JR Smith is hitting some big threes, how can you ensure that you bring that same kind of mentality on the road in Oracle and just seeing what you guys were capable of, doing that?","Well, we're going to watch the film when we get to Golden State, and let's see ways we can be better.  We didn't play our type of game in Game 1 and Game 2.  And if we don't do that, if we play like we played in Game 1 and Game 2 of this series, the series is over.  So we have to continue to play how we played at home.  We have to be physically -- be physical at the point of attack, we got to continue to move the ball, share the ball.  And tonight we had 27 assists, and that's very key."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"The first three games you guys kind of struggled from beyond the arc, hit 24 tonight.  Just how different of a team are you guys when you're just knocking those perimeter shots down?","That's part of who we are.  We set a lot of records since we kind of assembled this team the last couple years.  And that's just part of who we are.  We got guys that can stretch the floor, make big shots, and they did it tonight, from Ky, Kevin, and Swish, and everybody else chipped in as well."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Did you talk with your teammates before the game and just stress like we're not going out like that, something along those lines?","Well, I didn't hear it, but some of the other guys heard it and told me that that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker rooms, and I think it came from Draymond, which is okay, that's Dray anyway. But so I just told guys, I didn't stress anything besides just live in the moment.  Live in the moment.  We have a great opportunity to give ourself another opportunity to keep going.  We played well in Game 3, well enough to win, and we just didn't do it.  But tonight we came out and we stuck to the game plan our coaching staff put together and we -- this was as close to a 48-minute game we played in the post-season.  Even in the first couple first three rounds, this was close as -- to a 48-minute game as we played.  It was big for us."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"How important is that, that everybody standing out for the game, and also do you finally feel that tonight you guys are who you are?","Well, I think the last two games we have played Cavaliers basketball.  We have been physical, we haven't turned the ball over, and we have shared the ball.  In Game 3 we just -- down the stretch we couldn't make any shots, and they did.  And that was just -- it's a make-or-miss league at that point. So in the last couple games we have been playing Cavaliers basketball, and it's resulted in us just playing better and us getting this win tonight."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Kind of looks like dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again, you guys going back west down 3-1.  Do you have these guys just where you want them?","No, they got us where they want us.  Listen, at the end of the day, we want to just try to put ourself in position to play another game, and we did that tonight and hopefully we can do it Monday night where we can come back here. So our mindset is try to go up there and get one.  Which is probably one of the toughest environments we have in this league, along with our building.  And so we look forward to the challenge and the matchup."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"40 more tonight for Kyrie, LeBron, coming off of the difficult end to Game 3, big performance from him, did you feel that he was going to be able to bounce back in a big way after that tough end to Game 3, and what else did you see from him tonight?","He's just been very special in closeout games.  On both sides.  Us being able to close out a team trying to close out on us.  He's just been built for that moment.  I said that over and over again, that he's always been built for the biggest moments, and tonight he showed that once again.  It's not surprising.  He's just that special."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Whether it's adversity or desperation or intensity, this group, as we have seen it the last couple of years, seems to always respond to it.  What is in your guys' makeup that allows you to only have that really come out in these situations?","I don't know.  I don't like it. (Laughter.) It causes too much stress, man.  I'm stressed out.  Keep doing this every year.  But listen, at the end of the day we just got some resilient guys.  The Warriors have championship DNA, and we do as well.  We're battle tested, they're battle tested.  And getting swept is something that you never want to have happen.  Especially this point.  You get all the way to the Finals, you hate to get swept, lose two games on your home floor.  So I think a lot of guys had that in their mind today, and they came out and played like it."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Physically, are you okay?  We saw you getting some treatment after the game.",I'll be all right on Monday.  I'll be all right on Monday.
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Couple of years back, obviously, Andy was kind of that spark plug energy-wise.  How different is it now when Tristan can play the game that he was able to play tonight versus last three games, from just a collective team-wide energy standpoint?","He's a big piece of our puzzle.  We all know that.  He's been huge for our success the last three years, and they did a -- they have done a great job of putting him in the game plan and neutralizing what he does best, and that's offensive rebound and giving us extra possessions.  And it's been very tough on him in this Finals so far.  But he didn't get down on himself.  He came through when we needed him the most, and that was tonight, getting 10 rebounds and also dishing out five assists.  So that was big time."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"He's a professional, but you've referred to him before as your little brother.  Have you had any talks with him over the last three games after any sort of frustration or struggles in regard to being ready for Game 4?","Yeah, I have.  I'm not here to tell you guys what I've been talking to him about or what I -- but he knows what I expect out of him.  Like I said, tonight we needed him the most, and he was there."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"After Game 3 being such a letdown, did you have to work into believing that something like tonight was possible?  And if you did, when did you get to that point?","No, I didn't have to work into believing it.  At the end of the day I had the same game day ritual.  And I slept great last night, came to shootaround, got my work in, I went home, took my usual pregame nap, got up, ate my pregame food, came to work. I didn't feel anything, actually, I was just excited about the moment.  It is what it is.  You come to work and you put in the work and you study the game for myself, and you just do everything to put yourself in a position to succeed. There's no reason to add any more pressure to it.  And I'm not saying it was the result of a win, because I've done the same thing for a long time now, but for myself, just being able to just stay even keeled no matter the situation, I think it's good for our ball club."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,This game lasted almost three hours and you had a triple double.  This game had a little bit of everything.  Do you feel as emotionally and mentally drained as you did the last game when you guys lost?,"I'm about there.  I'm about there.  It lets me know that I did what I was supposed to do when I'm emotionally and physically drained at the end of a Finals game.  If I'm not, then I didn't do what I was supposed to do.  So that would be two games in a row where I felt like that, and now I got to get my mind ready once again."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,The NBA life means a lot of traveling.  Do you have a particular routine on the plane?  How do you maximize your rest?,"Well, it's quite a long flight going out west, and so we try to get a little bit of sleep.  I try to get a little bit of sleep and then I get up and get treatment on the plane.  Just give my body as much treatment as I can on the plane and get a couple hours of rest.  Obviously it's going to be probably not too -- it won't be a long -- it won't be easy for me to sleep tonight because I'm still going on with the game and things of that nature, my body is not feeling as great, but I'll be fine tomorrow."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,How did your approach to the game and your style of play evolve between the first Final you played in and this one?,I stunk in the first Finals.  I don't stink anymore.
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Kyrie was in here and he said that he always is looking at social media.  He says he sees everything.  You've talked about a lot of times about how you're past that, you don't listen to critics and everything.  Do you talk to your teammates when all of this stuff is kind of floating around about curses and Cavs in seven tweets that kind of go viral on social media about kind of pushing that stuff away?","No, I don't see it.  So I can't talk to my teammates about it because I don't see it.  Unless one of the guys brings it to me, either as a joke or something they want me to see, but I don't -- it don't go -- I don't have notifications on my phone.  I don't have none of the apps on my phone right now so I can't even like click on it and accidentally click on it.  I don't get involved in that, man.  Because I'm like, I know, like I'm like every other mention when I play.  And I don't -- I don't like it because people just be talking like -- people talk crazy, man.  I'm going to leave it at that.  So I know better."
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Tonight's game was so physical, and also dramatic.  How do you guys make it to focus on basketball and not to be distracted and especially keep the lead?",At the end of the day the game is supposed to be played physically.  Both teams were wanting to put themselves in the record books and put themselves in basketball history.  So try to do whatever it takes to win.  I think both teams definitely are trying to do that from game to game.
2017-06-09,40:46,31.0,0.5,10.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Just your reaction to that first quarter, first half, both record setting.  I mean, you came within a free throw of 50 for a quarter and 80 whatever it was at half.  Did you have a minute to think about what was going on?","No.  You can't.  First of all, if you take a minute to see what's going on versus this team, they hit you with a 50-point quarter.  There's no -- you can't -- we were just playing in the moment.  We're just playing good basketball.  We were in attack mode, and it results in us having 49.  The reason we didn't hit 50 is because I can't shoot a free throw.  So, but I'll be better in Game 5.

2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"I know every season's different, every series is different, but two years ago you sat at your locker for 45 minutes with a towel over your head after the game ended.  Tonight you're in here already.  Can you go through your emotions in the moment and how -- it sounds silly, how this feels.","Well, for me personally, I left everything on the floor every game, all five games.  So for me personally I have nothing to be -- I have no reason to put my head down.  I have no reason to look back at what I could have done or what I shouldn't have done or what I could have done better for the team.  I left everything I had out on the floor every single game for five games in this Finals, and you come up short. So it would be the same if you feel like you wrote the best column of you your life and somebody picked another one over you.  That's -- how would you feel?  You know, so you wouldn't hold your head down, but you would be like, okay, it's just not my time. So Golden State is a worthy opponent, obviously been the best team in our league for the last three years, the best team this year, and they showcased that throughout the post-season, and we were another opponent in their way. It's just unfortunate for some of the guys on our team that's never been able to get this far and not be able to hold the trophy up.  And those are things that kind of bother me more than anything.  Guys like Kyle and Derrick and Deron and Kay and Edy.  So, emotions are all over the place right now."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"You guys are obviously competitors, you think you can overcome everything.  Was there ever a point in this series where you felt overmatched, like you weren't going to be able to do this?","No, I don't think I've ever -- not one time did I feel like we were overmatched until probably like I looked up, there was like a minute 20, and we were down 13, I believe, or something at that point.  And I was like, okay, we left everything on the floor, and it still wasn't enough. So that's -- they assembled a great team.  We were able to get them last year, and they went out and got one of the best players that this league has ever seen, so they did a good job of -- a great job, their front office and their players, by doing that recruiting, the things that they did in the summertime, and obviously it paid dividends."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"32 years old, 14 years in the league, and now there's this team out West that has won two championships the last three years.  How do you view them when you look at what's your future in the league?","Well, it's a two-sided question because for me personally -- I don't know.  I need to sit down and figure this thing out.  And so I don't know as far as me personally right now. But as far as that team, they're going to be here for a while.  They're going to be around for a while.  Pretty much all their guys are in their 20s.  Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don't show any signs of slowing down. So there's going to be a lot of teams that's trying to figure out ways to put personnel together to try and match that if they're able to actually face them in the Playoff series, both Eastern Conference and Western Conference.  Because they're built for -- from my eyes, they're built to last a few years.  So we'll see."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"You said you have a sense of history about this.  You averaged a triple-double in The Finals, never been done before.  You referenced maybe the best.  Was this your best series you've ever played?","I don't know.  This is my 8th trip to the Finals, and I've had some pretty good ones in my day.  And like I said, I just try to do everything to just try to help this team win and more.  For me to go out there and for the guys that allowed me to be the leader that I am and allow me and trust me that I'm going to make the right plays and I'm going to do the right things and have the right intention, that's a compliment to a my guys, it's a compliment to the 14 guys that allow me to do at that and the coaching staff. And I just try to put in the work.  I put in the work individually, in the film room, in my mind, my body every single day to prepare myself for whatever obstacle that this ball club entails.  Does it always result in us winning?  No.  This is my third year here, and we haven't won every game.  We haven't won every Finals, obviously.  We lost two of them. So but like I've always told myself, if you feel like you put in the work and you leave it out on the floor, then you can always push forward and not look backwards."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"You mentioned all the energy you exert, and obviously you worked so hard.  What do you plan on doing to get away from the game for a little while, and how long before you recharge your batteries and get back at it?","I don't know.  I probably won't stop working out.  I think it's just a lifestyle for me.  So I probably will be back in my gym in the next couple days just because it's just who I am. As far as being back on the basketball court, I'm going to take a while.  I don't need to be back on the basketball court right now.  I need to get off of my feet and let my joints and let my body kind of recover from being out on the floor for 14 straight years. So but I'll train.  I'll train all summer.  It's just a part of who I am now, just a part of my lifestyle."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"Five years ago you broke through, got your first championship against Kevin Durant.  Having those burdens and those expectations to finally achieve it, I'm wondering if you could offer your perspective what you think it must be like for him, having experienced something like that yourself?","It's a great feeling.  When you're able to work hard, you're able to put in the work and accomplish a feat like that, it's something that we all dream about.  Growing up in our inner cities, a lot of hard work and through high school, through college, if you went to college, and through the NBA, you always hope that you will be in a position to be able to not only compete for a championship but win a championship, and it's a great feeling."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,Obviously you can't control where free agents go and teams get stacked or whatnot.  How you would you look back at this season?  How can you assess this season?,"Our team, our ball club?"
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,Yes.,"We had some good times.  We had some bad times.  We had some times where -- the biggest thing of this season is we weren't able to get healthy.  When we finally got healthy, the Playoffs was right around the corner.  And we showed what we're capable of doing when we got a full unit.  It would have been great to see us at a full unit throughout the whole season so we can continue to build and build the camaraderie and build the chemistry out on the floor so you don't have to wait until April to see what you're capable of doing. And, yes, we were able to hit the switch, but those games in January, those games in November, games that people think that's not important, they're important to me, and they would have been important to our ball club. But, whatever, we figured it out and got to the post-season as a two seed.  We controlled home court and were able to win on the road in the Eastern Conference Finals in Boston, and we were able to punch our clock into competing for a championship.  And as a ball club and as an individual, that's all you want, is an opportunity. Now, obviously, we ran against, like I said, a worthy opponent, one of the best Playoff teams that this league has ever seen, obviously, and we weren't able to get over the hump and accomplish what we ultimately wanted to do.  But it's no such thing as a failed season when you put in as much work as we have done individually and as a ball club since September.  Since late September."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"You just said I need to take some time and sit down and figure this thing out, big picture, Warriors, all of that.  Does it feel like the puzzle pieces are out there, you just can't see them yet?","Well, I don't know.  I'm not a -- I'm not the GM of the team.  I'm not in the front office, but I know our front office is going to continue to try to put our ball club, put our franchise in a position where we can compete for a championship year in and year out. Like I said, teams and franchises are going to be trying to figure out ways that they can put personnel together, the right group of guys together to be able to hopefully compete against this team.  They're assembled as good as you can assemble, and I played against some really, really good teams that was assembled perfectly, and they're right up there. So we will see, but I will get away from the game a little bit, probably watch some WNBA games, though.  Can't get away from it.  I'll probably watch -- my son's tournament is this summer, so I'll be a part of the game.  But as far as me actually playing, I won't.  I won't be a part of the game much this summer."
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"You've been a part of two super teams, the one you have here, the one you had in Miami, looking at what the Golden State Warriors have done, are you still a fan of the concept?  Do you think it's a good thing for the NBA to build these teams how they brought in Kevin?  You get what I'm asking?","No, not really.  I don't believe I've played for a super team.  I don't believe in that.  I don't believe we're a super team here.  So, no, I don't really, I don't -- you guys want one more question before I leave and not see you guys for a long time?"
2017-06-12,46:13,41.0,0.633,13.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0,"It was mentioned before that Kevin Durant lost his first NBA Finals when you won your first NBA Finals.  Kind of fast forwarding to right now, how is he a different player and a different person since you do know him personally, and even though you're -- obviously you're upset because you lost, how do you feel about him winning that first championship?","Well, I'm not happy he won his first.  I'm not happy at all.  But at the end of the day from when I played him in the 2012 Finals to now, like I said, experience is the best teacher in life, and he's just experiencing and experiencing and experiencing.  And it also helps when you are able to experience some things with this team as well.  He felt like he needed to reassemble and reassess his career and come here. So like I said, having -- getting that first championship for me was like having my first son.  It was just a proud moment, something that you never, ever forget.  And at the end of the day, nobody can -- no matter what anybody says from now on in your career or whatever they say, they can never take away from you being a champion.  That's something that they are always going to speak about, about you.  It may be like the last thing they may say, but they are always going to have to say that you're a champion. Like I said, when you put in the work and things pay off, then you can always be okay with whatever else that happens in your career. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,What did you think of the job -- I know he had a lot of help -- that Marcus Morris did guarding you?,"I thought they had great game plan Game 1.  He was the start of it.  He was my matchup, and I think they did a great job of communicating throughout the whole game, knowing where I was and knowing where our teammates was. Brad and the coaching staff did a great job in Game 1.  You commend that.  We have an opportunity to look at a lot of film tomorrow, and see ways they were making us uncomfortable, making myself off balance and not have a rhythm all game.  So we'll be much better in Game 2."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, what did you see differently from the Celtics defensively that you maybe didn't see against the Pacers or the first round matchup, or the Raptors?","No, I've seen every coverage, pretty much.  For me, Game 1 has always been a feel-out game for me, if you've ever followed my history.  So I've got a good sense of the way they played me today and how I'll play going into Game 2."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, speaking of history, this building has been the scene of some of your greatest playoff accomplishments and some disappointments along the way too.  Those Celtics teams were built much differently though, veteran teams, Hall of Famers.  How is this challenge different for you, and how are you different now than you were back then?","Every year is a different challenge, no matter if you're going against the previous Celtics team or the present.  They've always been well coached.  They've always had multiple guys on the floor that can do multiple things, and they've always had two-way players. That challenge has never -- it's not like it's been different.  It's always been that same challenge.  So for me as an individual I just try to get better every year to put myself in a position where I can be successful."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, you got started off 0-for-14 from three.  When you're having a game like that, do you think that you and your teammates can feel the misses going into the next shot, and what do you feel about three-point shots moving forward in this series for you guys as a team?","Well, I mean, three-point shots is a part of our DNA.  It's what makes us the best team that we can be.  I think even early on with the shots that we had, we had some wide-open looks that just didn't go.  I think in the first quarter, J.R. [Smith] and Kev [Kevin Love], G. Hill [George Hill], they had some great looks, they just didn't go.  We're okay with that.  We're absolutely okay with that.  And we're going to take those same looks going into Game 2 if the opportunity presents itself."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"They had guys they were putting on you initially in any given possession, but you seemed to be able to get the switch to a different guy pretty quickly off that.  Do you think you exploited that switch enough to getting the secondary guy on you?","Well, like I said, I'm going to get the opportunity to break down the film tonight and tomorrow and see ways that we can be better to offensively have a much better rhythm."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,Do you come out of this one thinking the Cavs need to adjust?,"Well, I mean, you definitely have to adjust.  That's what part of the playoff series is about.  The teams adjusting from game to game and seeing ways you can be better.  I think that's an obvious question."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"But you were talking about how the three is part of your DNA.  You could change a lineup and go with a much different look.  You could have Tristan [Thompson] in the frontcourt, which would change matchups.  Did you see enough in one game to want to go in that direction, or do you stay with what got you here?","Well, I mean, you're asking a tactical question as far as something I can't control.  That would be a Coach [Tyronn] Lue question if he wants to change the lineup or not.  I think our coaching staff will give us the best game plan to go out and win, no matter who is in the starting lineup going into Game 2. The three-point shot has been a big part since we pretty much assembled this team four years ago, and I think it's going to be a big part of it throughout the series, as long as we continue to get the ball moving and guys feel in good rhythm."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,Al Horford made a couple plays in that early run for them.  How important was that to set the tone for this game?,"I think it started from their momentum and what they wanted to do started from the tip ball.  Horford tipped it right to Jaylen Brown and it looked like we had two on them, and next thing you know he's getting a lay-up right off the tip.  So that kind of set the tone right there. We missed some shots, they made some shots.  Horford hit a big three and also was able to get an and one and get Kev his early two quick fouls.  So it kind of just started from the beginning."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,The Celtics defense was more physical and aggressive at the point of attack tonight than they were in the regular season?  That something that surprised you guys when you were trying to get into your actions in the half court?,What do you mean?  Are you asking me were they more physical or are you saying?
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"I'm saying they were, but I'm asking did that affect the way you guys executed your plays in the half-court?","No, physical basketball is part of playoffs.  That's what you expect.  I don't think you can just say that because you're not on the floor, but physical basketball is part of the postseason.  So it's easy to make a narrative when you win or lose to say, okay, you guys played bad offensively and you lost, and then you win, and it's like, oh, you played better. So physical basketball started from Game 1 in the Indiana series when Indiana punched us in the mouth too in Game 1, and it's been like that throughout."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"LeBron, you guys were off practically a week.  Did you feel that you might have lost some of your rhythm as a result?  Was it kind of loose at the beginning of the game for you guys?","I don't think so.  I thought offensively we got to where we wanted to get to, but they also shut off a few things that they wanted to do as well.  But I don't think it was a rhythm thing.  We had some really good looks.  We had been off before in previous years when we had weeks and week and a half.  So that has nothing to do with it. At the end of the day you play the game when the schedule comes out and you get ready to go."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"Start of the fourth, I think they cut it to 14.  Do you have any idea what -- I mean, I think they scored seven quick ones.  Any idea what happened there?","What happened?  We ran them -- the first possession we ran them down all the way to two on the shot clock.  Marcus Morris missed the jumpshot, fouled it up, they got a dunk.  We came back down, we ran a set for Jordan Clarkson, and he came off and missed it.  They rebounded it, and we came back on the defensive end and we got a stop.  They took it out on the sideline.  Jayson Tatum took the ball out, through it to Marcus Morris in the short corner, he made a three.  We come back down, missed another shot.  Then Tatum came down and went 94 feet, did a Euro step and made a right-hand lay-up, timeout.  There you go."
2018-05-13,36:07,15.0,0.313,7.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,0,"Not your first rodeo, down 1-0.  What is your level of concern at this stage?","I have zero level of concern at this stage.  I didn't go to college, so it's not March Madness.  You know, you get better throughout the series.  You see ways you can get better throughout the series.  But I've been down 0-1, I've been down 0-2.  I've been down before in the postseason.  But for me, there's never no level of concern no matter how bad I played tonight with seven turnovers, how inefficient I was shooting the ball. I'm just as confident going into a series whether it's a 0-0 series or I'm down 0-1.  So we have another opportunity to be better as a ball club coming in Tuesday night, and we'll see what happens.

2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,"How did you feel after the collision with Jayson Tatum in the first half, and do you think it affected your game in the second half at all after the collision? Le","I felt like I needed to go back to the locker room, which I did, and kind of recalibrate.  It was a tough blow.  Obviously incidental.  His shoulder hit me right square in my jaw.  Just wanted to go back to the back and make sure everything was fine. But I don't think it -- it didn't affect my game after that."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,We've talked to Ty [Lue] and a couple other guys about this.  Do you feel like as a team you kind of lost your composure in the fourth quarter? Le,"No, I don't think so.  I think that's easy to say.  I think we had some good looks.  We had an opportunity.  It was a two-possession game.  We were down six.  We had a great trap in the corner on Jaylen Brown, and I felt like we played great defense and a foul was called on Al Horford, he goes and makes two, we don't score, and it kind of sends it back to a 10-point game after that.  Not as well as we would like to play in the second half.  It was a two-possession game at one point.  We had a great defensive sequence that ended up in a foul for them, so that didn't work out for us."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,What is your reaction to Marcus Smart's impact on tonight's game and this series so far? Le,"I think Marcus always makes plays at the right time.  His ability to play multiple positions, but they put the ball in his hands and they trust him to take plays for others.  He has a really uncanny ability to get into the lane and either creates for himself or create for others, and he did that tonight with the nine assists and also had some offensive rebounds and also some missed shots.  He's always been very productive for their ballclub."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,"I asked Ty, that stretch bridging the end of the first half into the third quarter, how did that turn around in the game? Le","With turnovers.  Turnovers and not defending full shot clock, especially in that third quarter.  We've had our third quarter woes this whole season, and tonight was another example of that."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, you use that phrase zero concern the other day after the game, one loss.  When you have 42 and a triple-double and you still lose, what's your level of concern now? Le","We have an opportunity to go back home, protect home court.  We're going to use these days to really dive in on what needs to be done to help our ballclub be successful.  They did what they had to do, and that was protect home, and now it's our time to try to do that, as well.  We have a few days, like I said, and we're going to see what we're made of on Saturday."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,I know you talked the first question about your injury.  Were you checked for a concussion? Le,"I was checked for multiple things, and I passed them all.  That's why I was able to come back and finish the half."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,"You mentioned after Game 1 you've been down 0-1 before, you've been down 0-2 before.  This is the first time you've been down 0-2 in the East in 10 years.  How do you think you will digest that challenge over the next couple days and prepare yourself for what's going to be called for from you? Le","How will I digest it?  I'm going to go home tonight and see my three kids, see my family, recalibrate, see my mom.  I think I'll be fine.  I'm not going to lose sleep over it.  You go out and when you lay everything on the line, at the end of the day, you can live with that.  I'll recalibrate as far as how I can help this team continue to be successful, how I can do some things to make us be even more complete, and I probably -- the only way I probably won't get no sleep tonight is if Kev [Love] don't get asked a question asked.  I'm going to lose a lot of sleep if someone doesn't ask him a question.  I'm leaving.  (Laughter)."
2018-05-15,38:46,42.0,0.552,10.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0,"LeBron, it was kind of a physical game all night.  How do you think you guys responded to the way they played? Le","I mean, it's the Playoffs, so we expected for it to be physical.  I wouldn't expect anything less.  I think we matched the physicality today.  We gave ourselves a pretty good chance with 36 minutes, and that 12 minutes in the third quarter, that killed us.  But as far as the physicality of the game, I think we was what we needed to be as far as that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2018-05-19,37:30,27.0,0.667,5.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, your defensive numbers tonight were your best of the postseason as the primary defender.  What was your mindset about being more active defensively, and what made it easier for you tonight? Le","Just tried to put myself in position to help our team.  I think tonight as a group, even when things broke down, we just covered for one another.  We made them make extra passes.  We made them make extra dribbles.  We were flying around, and I just happened to be one of the guys on the floor that wanted to fly around as well."
2018-05-19,37:30,27.0,0.667,5.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,Why does that happen to you guys on certain nights like tonight and then you get other nights where it doesn't? Le,I don't know.
2018-05-19,37:30,27.0,0.667,5.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, how would you rate your passing as a skill compared to the rest of your game?  And then if you'd indulge me, the left-handed pass you had to Larry Nance Jr., in the lane, the left-handed pass to Tristan Thompson in the lane and the time you drove baseline and wrapped around Tristan, can you rank those three? Le","I think my passing is up there with every other aspect of my game.  It was something I kind of just knew I had when I first started playing the game of basketball, to be able to see things develop before they actually developed.  Then it was on me to kind of put the ball on time, on target to my teammates ever since I was a kid, and I started playing at age 9. To rate those -- first of all, with Tristan and Larry, being able to set the screen and get the man off my body for me to create some separation.  The first left-handed pass to Larry, I was able to keep my defender on my back for a little bit.  I saw their bigs step up just a little bit, and me having the ball in my left hand, I could pass with either hand so I was able to kind of shuffle a bounce pass to him for him to dunk it. The second one to Tristan was going right.  Tristan set a great screen, and Marcus [Morris] tried to steal for the ball so I was able to go behind my back to the left-hand side and then I saw [Aron] Baynes step out onto the floor so I was able to wrap that around him to Tristan. And then on the third one, I rejected a screen-and-roll and Baynes stepped up again.  I saw Marcus trailing me a little bit, so I saw I had the wrap-around pass because the other defender on the weak side didn't pull in on Tristan.  I don't know.  Seemed easy, right?"
2018-05-19,37:30,27.0,0.667,5.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,Is one of the three more difficult than the others? Le,They're all pretty difficult.  Don't try it at home.  (Laughter).
2018-05-19,37:30,27.0,0.667,5.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,"A lot was made the last couple games of how well their point guards played and how your guards struggled.  To see George Hill and J.R. both get off to good starts tonight, how important was that to get you guys going? Le","It's very important for our guards to be aggressive.  No matter if they are making shots or not, we want them to be aggressive.  It just keeps the defense at bay.  It allows me and Kevin to have more open lanes as well when those guys are being aggressive, looking for their shots.  You saw that in G-Hill's mindset to start the game.  He just had an aggressive mindset that if they're going to slide under his pick-and-rolls, he's going to shoot it.  He gets a swing-swing, he's going to shoot it.  He's going to attack.  And the same for J.R.  We always sit up here and talk about how much pressure me and Kev try to take off our teammates.  Those guys took pressure off us tonight.  Their aggression just settled us in and allowed us to play free as well."
2018-05-19,37:30,27.0,0.667,5.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1,"LeBron, a very efficient scoring right for you, 27 points on just 12 shots, but what a healthy boxscore, and how related are those two functions:  You only taking 12 shots and seeing everybody else just kind of flourish and everybody scoring the ball?  And Kevin, could you speak to his ability to facilitate that coming forth of the whole team, and how dangerous a team are you when it looks like tonight? Le","Well, I think if you look at any boxscore throughout the postseason or throughout the regular season, if you're able to get four, five, six guys in double figures, most of the time that team is going to win.  You look at the shot chart -- me with 12 and Kev with 12; G-Hill with 11 and even Jordan [Clarkson], his 18 minutes throwing up 11 attempts as well is just well-balanced.  Obviously every game doesn't work out that way.  We can sit up here and say why doesn't it happen like that every game, but it's just not how the game works every game.  But tonight was good ingredients of that for us to be able to get everybody involved.  Even Kyle [Korver], his shots in the second half, J.R.'s shots, everybody felt in good rhythm.  It's my job when everybody is in a good rhythm to just make sure I get the ball exactly where my guys need it, where all they can think about is just shooting it and just trying to put it on time on target."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,"A lot is being made about all four games being won by the home team, but now looking back, what were you guys able to do or what did you change, what was different about you from the first two games out there to how you've played in these two?","Obviously we were a lot better defensively, flying around and making them take contested shots and making them make the extra pass and still being able to fly around.  Our communication level has been up obviously in the last two games.  As loud as it is in the Garden, we've got to be able to transfer that energy and that communication into Game 5 in order for us to be better than we were in Game 1 and 2."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,"You've talked a lot this year about being a new team with all the moving parts and whatnot, but most of the guys you guys are relying on have been there and four of you have won a championship.  Should you be ready for what you're going to see in Game 5, and what have you seen lately that would tell you that you are?","I mean, we don't know what we're going to see in Game 5.  Only the game gods know that.  We know it's going to be a hostile environment.  We know their fans are going to be very energetic.  But we have to just have our same mindset we had when we came home for these two games.  If our minds are there, we put ourselves in a position to be victorious."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,"Oftentimes when we ask you about Kyle Korver, it's draining critical three-pointers.  But tonight to see him throwing his body around, chasing down balls, going out of bounds, what does that say about his level of commitment and urgency in the playoffs?","I've loved Kyle ever since we made the trade to get him here.  I have no idea how Griff [David Griffin] was able to pull that off still to this day.  He's just a true professional.  There's not many of us '03 class guys still around.  I feel like we're just cut from a different cloth because we've been around for so long.  We have this work ethic and you see him every day putting in the work, putting his mind, his body into it.  It's not about his age.  I think it's just always keeping his body in the right position, especially in tonight's game. He's guarding -- how old is Jaylen Brown?  Can somebody help me?  21?  He's guarding Jaylen Brown, one of the most athletic wings we have in our league.  He's 21 years old.  Jaylen can fall on the ground 10 times and probably spring up and just as likely never feel it.  I don't remember Kyle falling too much like that.  I've got to keep his body as fresh as possible.  But listen, he's doing whatever it takes to try to help us win, with the blocks, with the strips.  Obviously his shot making is very key for our team as well, but it's just the intangibles he's doing for us defensively that has put him in a position to be on the floor."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,"We talked about Larry Nance Jr. a little bit this morning.  What have you seen from his growth from postseason Game 1 to now, and how important do you feel like his third quarter stretch was at the end there?","Like you guys always hear me preach about, the best teacher in life is experience.  From Game 1 in Indy until now, the experience, the atmosphere, he understands what the postseason is all about now.  The more and more time he gets, no matter if it's the 10 minutes he got tonight or if it's the extended time in Game 3, he continues to play good ball for us.  That's key for our team, and it's key for him as well as he continues to grow."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,"You've probably seen every kind of defense in your career.  Is Boston, what they're trying to do, a familiar defense to you, and what kind of adjustments have you made the last two games when you're at about 60 plus percent in each one of them?","Yeah, there's not a defense that I have not seen.  There's only so many that you can actually provide on the basketball floor, and I've seen them all.  Pretty much through when I started to play high school until now, so I've seen them all.  But they do a really good job with their communication, trying to force you to do things that you -- try to not do so well or kind of second-guess yourself.  For me, that's why I put in the work in between days and try to work on my game to where I don't -- you can't force me to do something I don't want to do or I don't have too much of a weakness.  I work on every aspect of my game.  But more importantly, my teammates are putting me in position and wanting me to be in attack mode and trusting me to put our guys in position to be successful. It's not about me.  It's about the collective group, and I'm one of the byproducts of that."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,Tonight you passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in terms of most field goals made in playoff history.  What does it mean to you?,"I don't know.  Listen, any time I'm in the same breath with the greats, I know you guys hear me say it over and over, it's just humbling.  To know where I come from, you guys know a little bit of the story.  But you guys don't know the full story about where I come from and the struggle that I had.  You guys know about the single-parent struggle, and y'all done heard that story.  But there's a lot more to it, which I'll talk about when I'm done playing ball. But to know where I come from, small city 35 miles south of here, and to hear I'm in the same category or talked about and jumping these greats in the playoffs -- it's like I was a kid and I watched the playoffs so much and I was like, I would love to be a part of that, that moment, that atmosphere.  I think it's pretty cool.  You hear the scoring, the field goals made, and for a kid that really doesn't care much about scoring."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys were able to continuously utilize mismatches in your pick-and-roll sets and what it does for your offense as a whole when you get those looks?,"I'm just watching them, breaking down film and seeing what's the best possible chance for us to be successful versus their defense.  I think this league is all predicated on trying to find mismatches.  That's every team.  If you look at the four teams in the postseason now, Houston is trying to find mismatches, Golden State is trying to find mismatches, Boston, and us as well.  We're all trying to find mismatches for us to try to be successful offensively.  It's not much of a secret.  You just try to execute once you get the mismatch or you feel like you have a position where you can be successful offensively.  Then you try to execute or just try to get a bucket.  We've been very successful in the last two games with doing that.  Boston was very successful the first two games with doing that."
2018-05-21,41:53,44.0,0.607,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1,"You answered your first question before and you mentioned the defensive intensity.  How integral has Tristan [Thompson] been, tonight especially with Kevin [Love] getting into foul trouble, but over the last two games to kind of even up that score on the defensive end?","Tristan has been everything for our defense since he got back into the rotation, got back into the starting lineup.  He's just been who who I've grown to know over the last four years.  Just always taking the one-on-one challenge.  Just having this meanness and toughness about him, not only offensively but more importantly defensively versus anybody.  He will guard anybody.  That's not saying that they won't score on him, but he will always take the challenge.  He won't shy away from any competition.  He's been great in the postseason.  It's not even these last two games, but in the postseason in general. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,"Ty Lue was asked today if he felt you looked tired out there on the court, and he responded yes.  So my question is physically how did you feel out there today?","I had my moments.  But I think everybody at this point is tired or worn down or whatever the case may be.  Still trying to make plays to help our team win, put us in position to win.  We had moments.  We had an opportunity, but we didn't make enough plays."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,"I asked Kevin [Love] if he could get a read on your team, and he wasn't sure.  Did you have a feel that you could match their intensity tonight coming into this game?","Well, I think defensively we held them to 36 percent shooting.  I think turnovers was another thing.  We had 15 turnovers for 15 points.  But defensively we were in tune.  We gave up 96 points.  Offensively, we couldn't make.  We couldn't make.  We were 9-for-34 from the three-point line, missed seven free throws.  Obviously in the postseason, scoring 83 points, you're not going to win many games like that.  But defensively we gave ourselves a chance.  We stuck in the game.  Even in the fourth quarter we made a run and cut it down to 11.  At one point we had two opportunities to cut it to single digits and missed some really good looks, two three-pointers.  We couldn't make.  And if you don't make, it's going to come back to bite you."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,"From your experiences, what's the hardest part about playing in an elimination game, and what do you guys need to do to make sure you come back to Boston for Game 7?","We've got to defend like we did tonight.  We've got to make some shots; that definitely would help.  I think going back home, we have a comfort level.  A lot of our guys have a comfort level of being back home and playing off the fans and playing off our crowd, playing off that court, being more comfortable being back home for Game 6.  We look forward to having an opportunity to force a Game 7.  It's up to us to see if we can come back here for one more."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,"We of course have talked about this a lot over the course of the year, but you're facing elimination again, and so people are going to ask and talk about is this your last game in Cleveland.  But beyond that, your Finals streak is now on the line.  Do you go into that game now having to win two, thinking about trying to protect that Finals streak at all?","No, not at all, because I've never went to any season saying, OK, let's have a Finals streak.  It's just all about just win every game and it should put us in position to play for a championship.  I've been in championship mode since probably '09.  We weren't able to get there then. Obviously I made the move to Miami.  I was able to go there four straight.  And three straight since I've been back here.  It just happens because I've been able to play with some great players, play with some great teammates, coaching staffs that have been able to put us in position to go to The Finals.  I've never said, OK, this is my third one or let's try to take to a fourth.  It's just the way the game has been played and I've been able to be successful.  We have another opportunity on Friday to be as good as we can be, play Cavs basketball on our home floor and force a Game 7."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,The home teams have played pretty well and the road teams have played not really well in this series.  Does that do anything to your confidence looking ahead knowing you'd have to win one here?,You're asking me or -- my confidence?
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,Confidence in your team.,"Well, for me I think I look forward to seeing us respond on Friday night.  I know how well we've played at home in this postseason.  That's the only thing I can worry about right now.  I'm not worried about a Game 7.  You have to worry about Game 6.  You can't put yourself in that moment until you take care of the present.  We're going to have another opportunity tomorrow to watch some film, go over some things that we can do better -- as we've done after every game in the postseason -- and see ways we can be even better for Game 6."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,What have you guys done as a team since the elimination game you faced in the first round against Indiana to now to better prepare yourselves to face this challenge?,"I don't know.  I have no idea.  You have your coaching staff prep you.  They put you in position.  They feel like this is the best for us to be as good as we can be as a ballclub, and it's up to us to go out and execute it.  Everybody is different.  I know how I prepare myself.  I know how I prepare going into each and every game, no matter if it's elimination or 0-0, whatever the case may be in a playoff game.  So I can speak for myself and know what my mindset will be on just trying to help us, like I said, do every facet of the game, to try to extend the series.  We'll see what happens."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,The last couple games you seemed to have a clear understanding of how they were going to switch on you in the pick-and-roll and how you wanted to pick that apart.  They went big a lot more this game and mixed their coverages up a little differently.  Did it make it less predictable?,"No, I knew exactly what they were going to do tonight.  They switched it up a couple times with their defense as far as what they were doing with my pick-and-rolls when I was either setting or handling.  But at this point, it's not even really about X's and O's.  I've seen all the defenses that they can put out there, so nothing was surprising."
2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,You have faced all the other Celtics playoff teams.  Would you say that this team is the toughest to date so far that you have faced?,"I'll speak in the present, and I think they're a very well-coached, well-balanced, hungry team.  They've got a bunch of young guys that were drafted very high and drafted very high for a reason, because they can do multiple things.  They can be aggressive offensively.  They can defend.  They can shoot.  They can put the ball on the floor.  They can make plays for themselves and for others.  I can speak for this moment right now.  I don't want to really talk about other previous teams I've played against.  I've played against a championship Boston Celtics team before, in '08, when they beat us in seven games.  But right now this is the present, and this team is really good.  Like I said, they're well-coached, they're well-balanced and we like the challenge."

2018-05-23,39:16,26.0,0.5,10.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,0,"I know you have a way that you measure turnovers if they're aggressive or bad turnovers.  Seven the other night and six tonight, that's an unusual high number for you.  How many of them are unforced and how many can you live with?","I had two turnovers where I felt like they were really bad.  My first turnover, I saw something happening and Marcus Morris did a great job of reading it.  I threw it up ahead to Kev [Kevin Love], and he picked it off.  My second turnover, I went baseline, lost my footing on Marcus Morris, another turnover.  A couple of them, one in transition to Jeff Green, I thought I put it on his hands, and he kind of fumbled it.  Wish I could have that one back and maybe bounce pass that one. I had a backdoor one to Swish [J.R. Smith].  It hit his hands.  Maybe I should have not thrown that one.  It was a little bit in traffic.  Al Horford was right there, but it hit Swish's hands.  Maybe I should have taken that one back. I had a post-up on Terry Rozier that they doubled from the baseline.  Jayson Tatum got his hands on him and I had a guy wide open.  I should have faked high and thrown it low.  My last turnover was just very, very careless on Terry Rozier.  We had a pick-and-roll, I got the switch and I just lost it out of bounds away from their basket. So that's my six turnovers.  I think out of those six, maybe three of them were just careless.  I think the other three were attack turnovers, and I'm OK with that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,How would you say your teammates responded with Kevin Love out?  How encouraged were you with that?,"I think they responded exceptionally well.  Our second quarter, our guys that came off the bench -- Jordan [Clarkson], Jeff [Green], Kyle [Korver] and Larry [Nance Jr.] -- they just gave us a huge boost in that second quarter.  That's the reason why we outscored them by 16 in that second quarter.  It was just huge.  We needed it obviously more than ever tonight with the situation that we were in."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,"We didn't get a real good look at what happened to you.  I think you banged knees, and then how you were feeling after that?  I think you scored 12 points to close it out.","I didn't get a good look at it, either, or I would have been able to avoid it.  After the game, I didn't know who got me.  But after the game Larry asked me if I was I OK, so I'm guessing he was the culprit of it.  I just felt someone fall into my leg and my leg kind of went in. I felt some pain throughout my entire right side of my ankle into my leg.  I was just hoping for the best, obviously, because I've seen so many different injuries, and watching basketball with that type of injury, someone fall into one's leg standing straight up.  Luckily, I was able to finish the game."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,"After that second long three in the fourth quarter, you kind of let out a scream and pounded your chest a little bit.  What caused that reaction, and what were you thinking in that moment?",The love of the game causes reactions like that.  Understanding the situation and understanding the moment that you're in.  It was just a feeling that you can't explain unless you've been a part of it.  That's all.
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,"We were talking in the '15 Finals when everyone was out with injuries and you said I can't play all 48 in The Finals because I burn too much energy.  You didn't play all 48, but it's pretty close.  With what you did in Game 7 against Indiana and tonight, have you exceeded stamina wise and energy wise what you are able to do on a court in a game like this?","Just try to put myself in the best possible shape each and every year to be able to go for the long haul.  Now, obviously I get a minute, couple minutes here, per quarter, would be great, but it's not what our team is built on right now.  Our team is built on me being out on the floor to be able to make plays, not only for myself but make plays for others.  It's just the way we've been playing, and we've been succeeding with it.  I was able to play 46 minutes today.  I got my couple minutes, I guess."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,"Going back to the roll-up on Larry, does that at all compare to -- against Chicago when you rolled your ankle, I think Griff [David Griffin] said your ankle bone hit the floor and everyone thought you were done and you just retied your shoe and walked back out there.  Does tonight compare at all to that?  Was one worse than the other?","Well, I wasn't coming out in either case.  Obviously, I would have had to literally have a real, real, really bad injury --  [Knocks on table]  I don't even know if this is ... that's not even wood; I'll find some on the way out -- to come off the floor with the opportunity we have to be able to force a Game 7."

What's it like pondering that chance?  Tristan Thompson said in the locker room this is what you live for, a Game 7 at the Garden.","Just go out, trust what you've built on all year.  For me, I don't put too much added pressure on myself.  I just go out and play my game.  It's a Game 7.  It's something that you wish you had when you're done playing, but more than that, it's just basketball for me.  I know what I'm capable of doing, and I'm going to trust everything I put into it."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,Can you kind of take us through the next 48 hours and how you're going to get yourself ready to be in Game 7 the way you were tonight?,"As soon as I leave here, I'll start to prepare.  I'm going to get in the car and head back to Akron.  As soon as I get home, I'll start my treatment.  I'll do the same all day tomorrow from before we leave to go to Boston, and then once we get into Boston I'll do that as well.  Try to get as much sleep as I can with tonight and with tomorrow and even on Sunday before the game.  That's the best recovery that you can possibly get, is when you're sleeping.  It'll be around-the-clock treatment, and we'll see what happens."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,You obviously have that extra gear when you know you absolutely have to win and you're exhausted.  What is the thought process?  What do you say to yourself?,"I don't know.  I don't really talk to myself much, to be honest.  I don't talk to myself much.  I just go out and play.  I have a drive.  I have a love of the game.  I have a passion for the game, and while I have the opportunity to lace my shoes up and put a uniform on, then I try to go out and do my job to the best of my ability.  Does it always work out?  Obviously, no. I'm not undefeated in my career.  Does it always -- me playing great?  I haven't always played great in my career.  But I just always want to try to maximize when I'm on the floor, and I've been able to do that in my 15th year so far."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,Ty Lue said that he feels like after six games you guys have the blueprint going into Game 7.  What's it going to take to execute that on the road?,"You've got to be poised.  You've got to be able to handle a punch or two.  And you've got to be able to combat that and be just as solid and just as aggressive on the offensive end.  We know it's challenging.  They're 10-0 on their home floor, and they've been very successful against us, obviously, at home.  But if you love challenges, then this is a great opportunity."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,"You've been a clutch player basically your whole career.  How do you feel you're evolved in the last few years in clutch situations, because it seems like especially the last few years when the going gets tough, you're always hitting.",What's your name?

(Laughter)  There's not many like you.  Either you're being very kind to me because it's National Wine Day or you know I love Brazil or I don't know what it is right now, but --"
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,The last few years --,OK.
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,Especially.,"There we go. No, I guess just being -- first of all, my teammates and my coaching staff have given me the reins to take the shot or make the play late in games.  When you have that ability and when you have that confidence from your 14 teammates and then your coaching staff and then you put the work into it, it's just a matter of just trying to come through.  Like I said, I haven't always done it in my whole career, but I've never shied away from it.  That's either making a shot or making a play.  I was taught the game the right way ever since I ever started playing the game of basketball.  My first year ever playing little league basketball, we won a championship.  My coach at the banquet gave everybody an MVP trophy. Everybody.  And that right then, I knew that this is a team game.  It's not about one individual and how much one individual can do in order to win championships.  In order to win, you have to have a full team.  And that's what it brought it down to me. The second year  we won it again, and we all got MVP trophies again.  It's just been instilled in me since I was 9 years old, when I first started playing, of what it means to be in a situation where your teammates rely on you.  Just making the right play no matter if it's a shot or if it's a pass.  I've always just been taught that."
2018-05-25,46:06,46.0,0.515,11.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,Do you feel like you embraced the situation more today than maybe you did in the past?,"I've embraced a lot of situations as you grow up.  I think that's just all part of experience and things of that nature.  I mean, I love being a husband now.  Did I embrace that at 18, 19?  I don't think so.  I mean, I've never been around married couples.  As you get older, you just grow into more things.  I didn't love wine until I was 30 years old, and now every other post is about wine, National Wine Day.  So you learn and you grow and you know what's best for you as you get older.  That's just all of us.  I think that's what being a human being is.  You find ways that you feel like you can grow and what you like and what you dislike.  At 18, I don't think I'm the same player that I am today at 33, and I shouldn't be.  I don't think me personally I should be the same person that I was at 18.  I'm just much more seasoned.

So how gratifying is this to get back, just given everything that you've been through?","To be honest, I haven't even really kind of processed it.  It was a great atmosphere tonight to be a part of that, be a part of another Game 7 on the road.  Those are things, like I said, when you're done playing the game, you can only dream and wish that you could be a part of that once again.  I haven't really processed the fact about going back to another Finals yet.  I know that's where we're headed.  I commend my teammates and my coaching staff and everybody that put the work in, even some of our staff that is not in the limelight, behind the scenes.  This was a complete team effort."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,I thought the 2012 game when you scored 48 against Boston was your signature game here.  Can you talk about where today fits in your competition against Boston?,"I don't know.  I just know it's the present, and that's what I'm all about.  I'm a guy who lives in the present.  For me, I just want to try to make plays tonight to help our ballclub win, to put myself in position, put my teammates in position to be successful.  We were able to do that."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,"That postgame moment you had with Al Horford, particularly Jayson Tatum, can you put that into words, and was anything said between you guys?","There was a lot said, but more importantly, it was just a mutual respect and the competition.  Me and Al, we've had a lot of battles in the postseason and been on a lot of All-Star teams together.  I've always had a lot of mutual respect for Al and the way he conducts himself, not only as a player but as a professional, both on and off the floor.  That was the moment there. And then with Jayson, I just love everything about the kid -- the way he plays the game, his demeanor, where he comes from.  I know his parents.  I just know he's just built for stardom.  He's built for success.  And that's both on and off the floor.  Two guys right there that -- Boston is very lucky to have them."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,"I know you said you're still processing this Finals trip, but the energy needed this season to get to this point, how would you compare it to other seasons where you've gotten to this point?","It's what's been asked of me, and I have to be able to just try to figure it out.  I don't know how I can compare it to other seasons because I can only think about this one in the present.  It was asked of me tonight to play the whole game, and I just tried to figure out how I could get through it.  Throughout timeouts, I was able to catch my breath.  At halftime, I didn't come out and warm up.  That was my time to recalibrate and catch my wind again.  It's what's been asked of me from this ballclub.  I'm the leader of this team, and I'm going to give what I've got.  My teammates, they respect that."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,You've said late in the regular season that this has felt like five seasons in one.  You guys have been buried and resurrected and buried and resurrected.  Is there a lesson there to be gleaned where you guys sit now on the brink of the NBA Finals?,"Well, it's now six.  It was five, now it's six.  It's now six seasons in one.  I guess this is the last chapter for our team in this season.  It's been a whirlwind.  I mean, it's been Cedar Point.  Sorry for you guys that don't know much about Cedar Point, but it's been a roller coaster.  It's been good, it's been bad, it's been roses.  There have been thorns in the roses.  There's been everything that you can ask for. I've said this has been one of the most challenging seasons I've had.  But like I told you guys, you guys are around us every day, right before the break, right before the trade deadline, I kind of reset.  Didn't know if we were going to make trades or not.  Didn't know what we were going to do with our team. But I just kind of reset my mindset and said, OK, this is the season and let's try to make the most of it.  That's what's gotten me to this point, gotten our team to this point."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,"What does it say about Jeff Green, the way he rose to the occasion both in Game 6 and today?","His number was called, and he just answered the call.  It's amazing.  Listen, at the end of the day, what he does on the basketball floor is extra credit.  This guy had open-heart surgery a few years ago.  The game was basically taken away from him, and they said it's possible you'll never play the game of basketball again.  The fact that he can put on a uniform every day and do the things that he does out on the floor -- I don't care if he makes a shot.  To make big plays like he made tonight -- for him personally, it's the cherry on top because the game was taken away from him.  So for him to be able to do what he did last game after Kev's injury and then obviously start tonight, it's big time."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,Ty Lue said that negative Cavs news sells.  Talk about how frustrating it is that people constantly criticize your team over and over again?,"I mean, I don't know because I don't really hear it.  I don't really get involved in it.  I kind of know the narrative throughout the season if we lose.  If we have a bad month, I already know what's going to happen on the outside world.  I've been a part of it.  If we win, I know the narrative.  I get it.  It's all a part of the storyline. But me personally, I don't really get involved in it.  I'm kind of over that at this point in my career.  But I think Coach Lue, he feeds off of it.  Some of our teammates kind of feed off of it, on just people counting us out and counting them out personally.  I think this tonight was another example of counting my guys out, saying they've been struggling, they won't play well on the road and whatever the case may be.  And counting my coach out.  I think they all rose to the occasion."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,"Along the theme of what we've been talking about, there were some really bad losses this year and some bad moments and team meetings and everything else.  Was there ever a moment where you lose hope that this is not salvageable, and how do you not if you don't -- how do you keep the faith and keep the hope that you can pull this back together?","I mean, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.  I wouldn't tell you.  (Laughter.) That's a good question.  You tried to get me there, right?"
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,"In a few days you're going to be playing one team that's really, really good.  People are going to say you guys are the underdogs.  What gives you the confidence that you can get this done this year?","At the end of the day, the game is won in between the lines, and we have an opportunity to play for a championship.  That's all that matters.  No matter what the storyline is going to be, no matter if we're picked to win or not, let's just go out and play ball.  We're going to have a great game plan.  We're going to try to get better throughout the series, and we'll see what happens.  For me, I don't know, I'm kind of like the wrong guy to ask because I just like to compete.  I have a love for the game.  I have a passion for the game, and everything else will take care of itself."
2018-05-27,48:00,35.0,0.5,15.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,1,"At 35-23, what let you know, even though shots weren't falling for you and your teammates, that it was possible to get back in it and win the game?","I think defensively we were just very, very sharp.  Very, very sharp.  We were flying around.  We were moving around and that continued to just keep us into the game.  Even with some of the plays that we made in the first half where we weren't knocking down shots, I always kept my confidence in my teammates and know that if we had the same opportunity in the second half they were going to knock them down.  And they did just that."

Is there a cumulative satisfaction to knowing that whoever it is, however long they've tried, none of them have done it yet?","It's been a satisfaction in the fact that I like to be successful.  But more importantly, just the work that I put into it.  I mean, it's an every-single-day work ethic that I have while I'm playing this game, while I have the ability to play this game at this level.  I love the competition.  I think about the teams that I've played over this run and the players that I've played over this run, slightly.  But more importantly, me just being healthy.  I've been healthy throughout this run.  I put a lot of work into my body, into my craft.  Being available to my teammates and being available to my franchise, the two franchises I've been with, and throughout this run is what's been more important to me than anything.  Always being available. I'll be available for at least four more games.  And we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

I seen the drive, I was outside the charge line, I stepped in, took the contact.  It's a huge play.  It's a huge play."
2018-05-31,47:32,51.0,0.594,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,Obviously in the moment there was an expression of frustration with JR the way the game ended.  What can be said now that you have to move past Game 1 and lift him up to get that play out of his mind?,"We got to move on.  This game is over and done with.  We had opportunities.  I would never give up on JR.  That's not my MO.  I don't give up on any of my players, any of my teammates, so I don't think that even needs to be said."
2018-05-31,47:32,51.0,0.594,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,Did he say anything to you guys?,"No, he didn't."

The second question, for the players that haven't been in the NBA Finals or your teammates that haven't been in the NBA Finals before, what is your message to them after such a tough Game 1 loss?","My eye's been better.  It's pretty much blurry, and it kind of got worse and worse as the game went on, after I drove and Draymond poked me right square in the eye.  So I'll deal with that over the next couple days. I don't think a message needs to be said.  We're in the fight now.  The Finals have started, and they've got a great taste of it tonight.  They know what to expect when we play again."

Did you think you were close to the restricted area, number one?  And number two, how many times have you seen, when they go to review, reverse that kind of call?","Like I said, I read that play just as well as I've read any play in my career, maybe in my life.  I seen the play happening.  I knew I was outside the charge line, and I knew I took the hit.  I don't know what else to say."
2018-05-31,47:32,51.0,0.594,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"You have a long track record of bringing your A-game to the NBA Finals.  I mean, this is your eighth year, you scored 51 points.  What contributions from your teammates do you think really brought your game to the next level?","I just try to do whatever it takes to help our team win and try to be a triple threat out on the floor offensively and being able to score, rebound, and get my guys involved.  So I just tried to do that tonight."
2018-05-31,47:32,51.0,0.594,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"As the officials huddle on that call, are you guys being told what they're even reviewing?  Did you have any idea of what it was that could trigger it, or did you know that's what they were going through?","No, we were told they were reviewing if I had my feet outside the line.  And when I knew that, I was like, okay, that's going to be our ball.  I knew I was outside the charge line, so that's what the communication was to us.  We were over on the sideline, drawing up a play, you know, to try to execute, try to go up a couple possessions."

I mean, you shot so well today, you were 19 for 32, you had 51, to recover in just a couple days and get ready for Game 2 after working so hard and playing -- your team playing so well today and just not coming out on top?","Well, I mean, we take this one.  We understand how difficult and how challenging this task is.  You take it all the way throughout the night thinking about it and ways you could have been better and plays that could have happened that could have gone your way and didn't go your way or things you could have done, and you wake up tomorrow with a fresh mind and you move forward."

2018-05-31,47:32,51.0,0.594,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,Would you say that this is probably the most frustrated or disappointed you've been coming off a Finals game knowing that you were right there and you had many opportunities to end?  Is this probably more frustrated than you've been after a loss?,"Because it's right now, I would say yeah.  I always live in the present.  I don't know how frustrated I was after a loss in the past.  I think we played as well as -- tonight we played as well as we've played all postseason, and we gave ourselves a chance possession after possession after possession.  There were just some plays that were kind of taken away from us.  Simple as that."

From where you stood on the court and from talking to him after the play, what's your reaction to it?  What is your version?",What do you mean what's my version?
2018-05-31,47:32,51.0,0.594,8.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Well, did he think the game was tied or did he think you guys had it salted away?",How do I know that?

I knew it was a tie game.  We were down 1.  George Hill went up, he made the first one.  We got the offensive rebound, you know, I thought we were all aware of what was going on.  That's my view.  So I don't know what JR was thinking.  I don't know the question you're trying to ask."

Did it seem that Golden State came out tonight looking to try to attack you a little bit more earlier in the shot clock and maybe tried to limit you as much to not drive as much?  You ended up with 13 assists, but it seemed like they really made you work hard tonight for everything you got.","I think I only got tired once tonight.  So, I mean, they doubled me a few times when I caught the ball in the post, something they didn't do in Game 1.  So I got off the ball, trusted my teammates.  But as far as working harder, I think I got tired once."
2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Steph set an NBA Finals record tonight with nine three-point shots, but some of them were much more difficult than others.  He had the 23 1/2 seconds of great defense, and goes out 25 feet, turns around and hits one.  How deflating is it when he's got it going and makes shots that almost he has no business making or taking?","Every shot that he takes that goes in, he has the business of making them.  That's what he does.  So shouldn't be surprised or deflated at it.  Take the ball out, move it forward, and try to execute on the other end."
2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,"Obviously Steph, Klay, K.D. had great games, as expected.  But how dangerous are the Warriors when you have McGee and also Livingston perfect from the field?  I think it was 11 field goals total, 11 for 11.","I mean, they're a dangerous ballclub no matter what.  It starts with those four guys, obviously, the four All-Stars.  Everyone else just does their job, and they don't miss a beat when they put someone in or they take someone out.  You know, it's not something that's surprising."
2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,"If you had to point to one or two things that you could take with you as a group going back to Cleveland for Game 3 that makes you feel good about where you could be in this series, what would it be?","Well, I think at the end of the day we have a Game 3 to play.  You know, we've got an opportunity to go home, and we played some really good basketball on our home floor.  But that shouldn't give us any comfort.  We should still be uncomfortable with the series as we were in Game 1 and as we were tonight."
2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,When you're facing -- a lot of people feel like the odds are against you in this series.  Do you feel like there is too much pressure put on you to be able to try to do too much for your team?  Is it fair?,"No, I don't really get caught up in that.  I mean, the odds have been against me since -- I don't know, since I was five, six years old.  So we're talking about basketball here.  It seems like I come up here and tell you guys this all the time.  The odds have been stacked up against me since I was an adolescent. So I put our team in position to try to win a championship, to compete for a championship.  You know, it's my job to make sure that we're as focused, laser focused as possible, do my job, and continue to instill confidence into my teammates until the last horn sounds. That's my job.  That's my responsibility.  That's my obligation, and I need to continue to do that, which I will."
2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,"You're one of those guys who has said a lot of times -- like you, Dwyane, a lot of guys over the years have said that a series doesn't truly start until one team wins on the other's home floor.  How much are you going to remind your guys that over the next three days?  Just, I mean, as hard as it might be to sell them on, to remind them that Golden State just held serve?","They did that.  But like I said, we want to continue to be uncomfortable.  Just because we're going home doesn't mean we can relax.  This is the last team in the world you want to relax against.  They've proven they can win on someone else's floor, no matter if it's through adversity as people may call it like when they were going through the Rockets series or whatever the case may be.  They've proven they can win on someone else's floor and do it in any fashion, in any way. I will continue to stay uncomfortable, and I hope our guys continue to stay uncomfortable no matter with us going back home."

2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,"You've always been a guy that played the game with a lot of love, with a lot of joy for the game.  In the moment that you're in right now, with the challenge being as great as it is and the burden on you as great as it is, does it make it harder to find those moments of enjoyment and kind of enjoying the competition as opposed to just continuing to just push and grind through?","Absolutely not.  I mean, it sucks to lose.  It sucks when you go out there and you give it everything that you have and you prep and your mind is in it and your body is in it and you come out on the losing end.  But nothing would ever take the love of the game away from me.  I think the love of the competition is something I live for and something I wake up every day and train my body for and train my mind for. Yeah, I mean, it sucks to lose, that's for sure, but it definitely won't stop me from preparing to be better the next day."
2018-06-03,43:51,29.0,0.5,9.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0,"You spoke with us yesterday about getting the treatment for your eye.  Still looking a little bloody there.  How was it tonight, and going forward do you think it's something that you just have to learn to work around?","Yeah, I mean, I'm going to have to work around it until it's not bloody anymore.  I mean, it's not going to keep me out of a game.  I'll be active -- what's today?  What is today?  Sunday?  When do we play again?  Wednesday?  So I'll be active.  I'll be in uniform, and I'll continue to try to make plays and help our team be successful and try to get one up on the board. The eye has looked a lot better.  My daughter don't like the way I look right now (laughing).  Yeah, she didn't like the FaceTime that we had earlier.  She was a little weirded out about it.  But I'll be fine.  So everything's good.  Appreciate it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"The core of this Cavs team has remained consistent for the last few years, but you've got a lot of new teammates on this team from a few months ago.  Are you confident that your teammates can mentally reset after this tough loss and be where they need to be for Game 4?","I mean, it's definitely a tough loss, and we had our chances.  But we have another opportunity on Friday to win on our home floor.  We've been pretty good throughout the postseason. So that's a good thing for us that we have an opportunity to extend the series, but we've got to come out and play 48 minutes.  We know this team that we're going against are the best -- first of all, the best third quarter team in the NBA, and once again they showed that tonight by outscoring us by 8 after we had a lead at halftime. So we have to be dialed in and play like we did in the first half and in the fourth quarter tonight."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"You twisted your ankle pretty badly there in the first half.  How is that feeling?  And Kevin Love was just in here and he talked about the margin of error being so small with the Warriors, especially in Game 1 and Game 3.  But how does that give you guys confidence going forward knowing how close you actually were to win those games?","To answer your second question first, the margin of error is very low.  You can't -- I mean, it's almost like playing the Patriots, you can't have mistakes.  They're not going to beat themselves.  You know, so when you're able to either force a miscue on them, you have to be able to capitalize and you have to be so in tuned and razor sharp and focused every single possession.  You can't have miscommunication, you can't have flaws, you can't have ""my faults"" or ""my bads"" or things like that, because they're going to make you pay.  When they make you pay, it's a 3-0 or 6-0 or 9-0 run, and it comes in bunches. The room for error, you just can't have it.  We know throughout the course of a 48-minute game there are going to be plays where, you know, it was a miscue there, it was a miscue there.  But for the most part throughout 48 minutes you just can't have a bunch of those, not especially against this team. To answer your first question, yeah, I twisted it pretty good, but I'll be in the lineup on Friday."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Two questions and both are bigger picture.  Now that you've been in this series with Durant and the Warriors now twice, can you articulate just how Durant has changed the complexion of this series and rivalry?","Oh, well, I mean, you guys ask me what is the difference between the Warriors -- you guys asked me this last year, what was the difference between the Warriors the previous year and this year, and what was my answer?  All right.  There it is.  Kevin Durant was my answer. He's one of the best players that I've ever played against that this league has ever seen.  His ability to handle the ball, shoot the ball, make plays at his length, his size, his speed.  So there it is."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"The other one, I understand you guys are down 3-0, but you've been very close twice, and they almost lost in the Western Finals.  So the question is are they at all maybe more vulnerable than you thought they were earlier in the year, mid-year, something like that?","At the end of the day, if you want to compete for a championship or win a championship, you've got to go through the champion, and they're the champion.  No matter -- everyone gets so caught up on saying they're vulnerable or they're not playing so well, and then they go down 3-2, and then they go to somebody else's floor and win.  Or they win at home and send it back to somebody else's floor and win in a Game 7. That's what championship teams do.  That's what championship players do.  They rise to the occasion, and that's what Golden State has done the last four years."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Even for someone like you who notoriously can have singular focus on one thing more often than not, how difficult will the next 48 hours be to just lock in on Game 4 and not think about how 1 and 3 got away or what might happen this summer?  How tough would it be for you to stay in this moment?","Tim, for me, tonight will be tough.  Tomorrow I'll replay some plays and some moments and things of that nature.  When I wake up Friday morning I'll be locked in on the game plan of what needs to be done to help our team win.  That's just who I am. So the rest of the night will be tough.  I'm not sure what time I'll end up getting to bed.  Tomorrow we'll come in and watch film, so it will replay in my mind throughout the day.  But Friday morning when I wake up, I'll be locked in and ready for Game 4."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Do you just tip your hat when K.D. makes the same shot from the left wing he made in Game 3 last year?  And how difficult is the shot?  He may make it look pretty attainable, but how difficult a shot is that?","No, that wasn't the same shot.  The one he made tonight was about four or five feet behind the one he made last year.  Last year we were up 2, and he pulled up pretty much right at the three-point line and got a great contest, but he made it. Tonight they're up 3.  They come off a pick-and-roll and he just stopped behind and pulled four or five feet behind the three-point line.  So same wing, different location. But you definitely tip your hat.  I mean, that's what he does.  He's a scorer.  You know, he's assassin, and that was one of those assassin plays right there."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Last game Steph goes off, an NBA Finals record, nine threes.  This time you hold him to 1 of 10 and another guy goes off.  Defensively what can you do to stop enough of them to a degree that you can have more points than they at the end of the game?  Also, could you speak to Rodney Hood's contributions tonight?","That's the challenge right there.  That's the challenge.  You know, that's why they've retooled this team, went out and got K.D. to where there's really not much pressure on -- you know, I won't say any of them to score, but if one of them has a bad game, they have three or four guys that can actually pick up the load. And as you've seen with K.D. picking it up today and Steph picking it up in Game 2, they all have the ability to -- we can't ever forget about Klay.  He's a guy that scored 40 in a quarter before.  So that's the luxury of having guys like that that you can always -- any given moment, they can kind of go off for a game. Even though we held Steph to one three tonight, the one he made was huge, huge.  So we've got to continue to just grind and defend as we did tonight.  I mean, out of the nine threes made, K.D. had six of them.  They were 9 for 36.  And that's, you know, pretty daggone good, holding that team to shooting to the free-throw line.  But we've got to add a little bit more, keep grinding. To your second question, I thought Rodney Hood was Rodney Hood tonight.  That was Rodney Hood, man.  He was just aggressive from the beginning when he got in the game, even though he missed his first three.  He had a wide-open shot, but he just continued to push and push. His athleticism and his length and his touch around the rim, you know, it was more than just what he did for the team, I think for himself, that was just a huge moment for himself.  That was good to see.  That was great to see, actually."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Knowing that you had that tremendous recall of moments in games, can you describe what was in your mind both tonight and last year when Kevin Durant launched that shot from the wing?","I actually think you should be like a psychiatrist.  You want to keep trying to get inside somebody's mind, is the whole thing, Mark. What's in my mind?  Miss it so we can get the rebound."
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,Did it feel like last year to you?  Did you think of it at that moment?,No.
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"Going back to the margin for error thing, when you're playing against a team like the Warriors, how much stress do you feel throughout the course of the game?  Is that something that can wear on you mentally in a way that it doesn't for other opponents?","Say that again, please?"
2018-06-06,46:52,33.0,0.464,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,"The margin for error, knowing that it's small going into a game.  Can you talk about the level of stress that you feel throughout the course of a game knowing that, and does it wear on you mentally in a way that it wouldn't with other opponents?","Well, I can take you back kind of to the battles I had with the Spurs when I was in Miami.  You just knew that they wouldn't beat themselves.  You just knew that like every possession we were playing San Antonio when I was in Miami, you just knew if you made a mistake, Manu, Tim, Tony, Pop will make you pay.  At times they did make us pay, and then you sprinkle in what Gary Neal did to us one game, what Danny Green did to us one game.  Then Kawhi, you just couldn't -- you could never relax. When you have great basketball players but also that can also think the game and be very cerebral about the game, that's what adds the level of stress, because you know that you can never, ever relax. And you should never want to relax.  It's The Finals.  It's the playoffs.  Even though this is a regular season game, you should always want to be on your toes.  That's what the part of competition is about.  So it adds to the level of stress. When you have Timmy D. and Manu and Kawhi and Manu, and now Draymond and Klay, Steph and K.D., and then you sprinkle in Iguodala and Livingston and all those guys as well, it adds a level of stress.  Because you know that you can never relax.  You know if you relax, they make you pay, and making you pay could cost you a game. So it's tough, but it's all part of the competition, which I love and which I continue to lace them up every night. Hopefully I got your answer for you.  Appreciate it.

Can you take us through what happened, and if it caused you any problems over the final three games?","What happened?  Self-inflicted, postgame after Game 1.  Very emotional.  For a lot of different reasons, understanding how important a Game 1 is on the road for our ballclub, what would that have done for us, the way we played, the calls that were made throughout the course of that game. I had emotions on the game was taken away from us.  I had emotions of you just don't get an opportunity like this on the road versus Golden State to be able to get a Game 1, and I let the emotions get the best of me.  Pretty much played the last three games with a broken hand, so that's what it is."

Do you feel like you've played your last game for the Cavs?","I mean, I have no idea at this point.  The one thing that I've always done is considered, obviously, my family.  Understanding especially where my boys are at this point in their age.  They were a lot younger the last time I made a decision like this four years ago.  I've got a teenage boy, a pre-teen and a little girl that wasn't around as well. So sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I'll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that.  So I don't have an answer for you right now as far as that."

There's been ups and downs.  It's been good, it's been bad. For me, I just try to be consistent throughout the course of the season.  Be the leader I know I can be for this ballclub, for this franchise every night, no matter what was going on from the outside or the inside, and be reliable every single day.  Showing up to work every single day.  Putting in the work and grinding every single day. I have no idea how the story will be talked about of my season, but, I know I punched the clock in every single day.  That's for me to understand that, and I'm okay with that."

Do you anticipate this just because of, like you said, the family and your kid's going into high school and your age and all those things, do you anticipate this summer being the toughest as far as deciding what the right path for you is?","No, I feel like '10 was the toughest."

2018-06-08,40:34,23.0,0.538,7.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,0,And the team.,"And the team.  I wondered if we could hit a switch some way, somehow, just because the course of the regular season it was just like, I don't know.  You guys ask me a lot, our beat writers kind of ask us throughout the whole season, and then we made the trades.  And right before the playoffs, a couple weeks before the playoffs: Do you feel like your team is ready for the postseason.  I didn't know.  It was just the unknown. I mean, our season was kind of the unknown.  I wondered if we could hit a switch in the postseason.  I figured if I stayed laser sharp, if I came in with the right mentality, if I came in with the right mindset, that I could help fast-track this throughout a lot of the games in the postseason because of my experience and because of some of the other guys that experienced a lot of games.  I was able to do that.  We were able to do that.  I mean, I don't know. I think it's never a success in the postseason when you lose, not for me.  I have no idea. But for me personally, like I said, being reliable to my teammates, being able to play the game at a high level with as many games and as many miles as I have on my body and put together a run like I had in the postseason, it's something that I can kind of remember.  The ending is obviously still fresh and still new, and you never want to lose, especially in this fashion, being a competitor.  But it is what it is.  Like I said, I punch my clock every day."

To be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember.  Honestly, I think we'll all remember that.  It ended a drought for Cleveland of 50-plus years, so I think we'll all remember that in sports history. When you have a goal, I think any individual, anybody, male, female, whatever the case may be, when you have a goal and you seek that goal out and you dream about that dream, and you put everything, and you care to -- you guys like this brace, huh (laughing)?  You guys like this cast, huh?  You want me to sit it right here for you (laughing)? I don't even know where I was.  I'm sorry.  Next question.  I'm sorry."

If you had to do that again in your career, basically start a team from scratch, what have you learned from this year that you're a different team in February from what you're playing with in The Finals?","Well, it's definitely not the most comfortable thing to start a team from scratch, because the most important is health, because you need to build chemistry so fast and camaraderie so fast on the floor.  And if you have multiple injuries or you have multiple bodies out, when you're starting fresh, it's too hard. I think with this season, that's what you kind of saw.  The difference between this season and the difference between my first year in Miami, we didn't have many injuries at all.  And we were definitely fresh together.  But myself and D-Wade and Bosh, you know, UD (Udonis Haslem), Mike Miller had a few injuries, but (Mario) Chalmers was available, and pretty much our team, we were pretty solid as far as being injury -- not being injury-prone. Obviously, my first year back here we were headed in the right direct, and then we hit the postseason.  Kev had a separated shoulder, and then Kyrie goes down in the first, second possession of overtime of Game 1 in The Finals. So, I mean, that's just huge.  So being a part of the start-fresh mode is something that you definitely don't want to be a part of.  It has its pros and it definitely has its cons."

2018-06-08,40:34,23.0,0.538,7.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,0,It's not a trick.,"Yes, it is.  I mean, for me, I still have so much to give to the game.  Like I said, when you have a goal and you're able to accomplish that goal, it actually -- for me personally, it made me even more hungry to continue to try to win championships, and I still want to be in championship mode.  I think I've shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode."

You can't go through this again.  What did you mean by that and what's this process like?  This free agency process of having to make a decision?  Can you just take us through and shed some light on what that process is like?","Well, I mean, I'm not going to take you throughout the whole process.  That's not fun.  But at the end of the day, like I said, when I decide what I'm going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last, you know, 20 years, pretty much, will have a say-so.  Then it ultimately will come down to me, and so we'll see what happens."

Are the decisions or the thought process, priorities, different at age 33, 15 years in than they would have been at those other junctures?","No, I don't think so.  I made the move in 2010 to be able to play with talented players, cerebral players that you could see things that happen before they happened on the floor, and your teammate can do the same throughout the course of a season, throughout the course of a game, throughout the course of a playoffs, throughout the course of a Finals. So when you feel like you're really good at your craft, I think it's always great to be able to be around other great minds as well and other great ballplayers, in my instance, and other great just, I think, studies of the game itself. That's never changed.  Even when I came here in '14, I wanted to try to surround myself and surround this franchise with great minds and guys that actually think outside the box of the game and not just go out and play it."

I think Floyd (Mayweather) was 1 at like 252.  Obviously, I don't have a boxing hand.  So boxing won't be the sport I'll be going to.  I don't know. At the end of the day, for me, staying around the game, being around the game will be something I'll probably do for the rest of my life, either while I'm playing for this later stage of my career, advising people in the NBA or whatever the case may be.  I've got two boys that play the game as well.  So I don't know.  I can't predict the future on ownership and things of that nature. But I have a lot of knowledge of the game.  I understand talent.  I know talent.  I know the right questions to ask certain guys and see if they're smart enough to actually think the game as well.  So we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

Try not to foul and put teams on the free throw line because those are easy points and we just trust our game plan.  We trust our, what we've been doing all throughout the course of this whole year.  We have a lot of length out there with myself, AD, Dwight, KCP and Danny at the start of that third quarter, and we were able to get some deflections, get some turnovers and get out and do what we do best on the break. You know, just having that type of size and that athleticism helps tremendously."
2020-09-18,30:54,15.0,0.545,6.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,1,You've talked about using Game 1 as a feel-out game.  Was there anything even after the first quarter that you guys identified when things seemed to switch for you defensively starting in the second quarter?,"Well, yeah, we knew the first quarter definitely wasn't Laker basketball, Laker defense.  We just had some break downs.  We had some break downs, took a quarter for us to kind of figure it out.  Not saying that we fully figured them out because it's too early in the series to say that but started to get a better feel and rhythm defensively and started to get some stops in the second quarter and build that lead up going into halftime."

That's my true answer.  It pissed me off because out of 101 votes, I got 16 first-place votes.  That's what pissed me off more than anything.  You know, not saying that the winner wasn't deserving of the MVP. But that pissed me off.  And I finished second a lot in my career, either from a championship, and now four times as an MVP.  You know, like I said, I never came into this league to be MVP or to be a champion.  I've always just wanted to get better and better every single day, and those things will take care of itself.  But some things is just out of my hand and some things you can't control. But it pissed me off."

I'm not going to sit up here and talk about what the criteria should be or what it is. It's changed over the years since I've gotten into the league, I know that.  You know, it's just changed.  It's changed a lot.  You know, sometimes it's the best player on the best team.  Sometimes it's the guy with the best season statistically.  Sometimes -- it's changed over the course -- over the course of my career.  I mean, you don't know.  You don't know. But you know, Giannis had a hell of a season, I can definitely say that."

And the next question would be, how much of your strong reaction do you think has to do with the fact that you've done what you've done in year 17 at 35 with a new team?  Does that factor into your kind of emotion here?","I mean, I'm fine.  Don't get it twisted.  I'm going back to my room.  I'm perfectly fine.  We're 1-0 in the Western Conference Finals.  I'm absolutely fine.  So don't -- like I was pissed off at the reaction earlier when I saw it.  I'm absolutely great now.  I'm going back to my room, drink some wine and sleep very well tonight.  Let's not get it twisted.  I'm great. It's just the voting scale is a little weird to me sometimes.  I mean, it you take 2012.  If you just stick with me -- or 2012-13, I had a chance to be Defensive Player of the Year and also MVP in the same season.  And that year [Marc] Gasol was [voted] Defensive Player of the Year, but he made Second Team All-Defense, okay. So that doesn't make sense.  It's like being MVP of the league but you make Second Team All-NBA.  That's when I really started to look at things kind of like differently.  I was like, how does that even make any sense.  It's like being Rookie of the Year but you make Second Team All-Rookie. And then I looked at the Most Improved this year, and rightfully so Brandon Ingram was amazing and I thought he should have won it.  But did you see the vote that Devonte' Graham got?  He averaged four points last year compared to 17 and a half.  If that's not improving, what is? And it's a weird thing sometimes that you just have -- I don't know how much we are really watching the game of basketball or are we just in the narration mode, the narrative."

What's it like to see a teammate that clearly you have great chemistry with that you wanted to have be in L.A. with you be the guy to make that shot and win this game for you guys? Le",Did you see my reaction?

Le","It's not about making a shot.  It's about having a belief of just taking it, for one, and living with the result.  I think right back to our game right before COVID hit.  We played Brooklyn at home and he had a similar shot right on that left wing in front of their bench to win the game and he missed it.  He was down on himself, but at the end of the day, I told him, if you're open, and I was able to drive that particular game and find him wide open and he just missed it. But it's just the confidence to take the shot.  You're not going to make them all, but the belief to just take it and live with the results is what it's all about.  Tonight was his moment.  Tonight was his moment to find a space, hunt the ball down and one of our top 10 assists leaders, Rondo, found him and he knocked it down.  A big-time play."

Were you getting the sense that he was sort of rising to that particular duel, even before that game-winning shot? Le","No, it's not about an individual matchup.  It's about us trying to execute and him just coming through for us. That's what he did.  It wasn't, okay, your turn, my turn.  It's about playing the game and trying to find ways to make an impact. Obviously, those two big shots that he had at the end, one was the floater to take the lead.  Joker was able to get the tip-in, and he comes back in with the three.  Just big-time plays, like I said, for a big-time player."

What do you think that's like for him to finally get to be in the big moments? Le",I don't know.  That's actually an AD question.  Just happy to have him.  I know what he brought to the table.  I know what he's about.  I know his skill set.  That's why I wanted him here so badly.
2020-09-20,36:25,26.0,0.5,11.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,1,You didn't have a timeout on that last play.  Were you able to talk about scenarios in which something like that could have happened? Le,"That's what this floor right here that we're all on right now is all about.  It's the practices; it's the shootarounds.  We talk about every single scenario possible:  up three; down three; up two; down two; do we have a foul to give, do we not; do we have a timeout, do we not; are we going full-court; half-court; BOB, which is baseline out-of-bounds; SOB, sideline out-of-bounds.  You talk about all those things.  You want to be a championship club, you have to be able to do that on the fly. So knowing we didn't have a timeout, we were able to get into a situation to a set that we worked on in practice and get right to it. The first option, for me if Do [Rondo] saw me over the top, and if not, AD flashes. And the rest is history."

Where does he fit on the leadership hierarchy on the team and how important is his confidence to step up and take a shot? Le","When you are trying to play high-level basketball, you have to have high-level IQ players, and he's one of them.  And not only does he have high-level IQ, but he also plays with high energy.  We know what we're going to get out of him every night. It's not about him making shots.  We know he's going to defend and he's going to play at a level that he's capable of playing at, and we all know that once he checks into the game every single night.  We know what to expect out of him.  To be honest, when he makes shots, it's extra credit for us.  But he puts that work in on his offensive skill set to get better and better.   We love everything about him."

I wanted to ask you about that and where your mindset is as this one continues, and where your mind is outside of the court, I should say. Le","For sure.  I know we're here playing the game, but I'm not losing the fact of what's important, as well.  More than a vote, it's about protecting black voters and voter suppression that goes on in our communities. Like you said, change isn't made by sitting on the sidelines.  That's one of our slogans and we're very proud of that.  Getting the people that want to join us, getting them gear and wearing the T-shirt and wearing the hats and wearing the hoodies, because when they go in their community, that's something that they can continue to enlighten, continue to educate, continue to make people empowered about this movement. We always talk about change in our communities, and now we have an opportunity.  We have an opportunity to really create change for the better and we look forward to this opportunity."

What was it like going to sleep to, hit a shot that you dream of growing up, isn't that what that situation is? Le","To be completely honest, man, it was probably one of the greatest moments of my career up until that point.  Just knowing the situation, we were about to go down 0-2 and we had home-court advantage.  We knew how powerful that Orlando team was, playing against actually my teammate now in Dwight.  So for me to be able to hit that shot was a huge moment for me.  I was still a young kid at the time, so big-time. The one thing I wish AD had tonight with the shot that he made, I wish we were playing at Staples.  We miss our fans so much and I can imagine in -- I probably would have blue the roof off Staples Center, AD hitting that shot with our crowd.  I would have loved to have that moment -- I know what it felt like for me when I was able to hit that shot that you mentioned against Orlando, Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals at the buzzer."

Curious what's the biggest thing that you've tried to instill in him during that time? Le","I think just staying even-keeled.  That's what it's all about.  The playoffs and the postseason, the more you advance into the postseason, the emotions and the adversity, it's going to be a roller coaster at times.  No matter if you're up, no matter if you're down, being able to keep your composure and your mindset on the main thing is very important.  This is the furthest he's gone in his career up to this point, and. I'm just happy to be here with him to give him any advice and lean on me.  To be completely honest, in the second half, I leaned on him, and he brought us home.  So I just tried to set the example early on, and we leaned on him, especially in the fourth quarter, and he brought us home."

This is obviously a process that you've gone through.  What is the challenge for an athlete both to ask for that, to seek that out, but then also to perform when that moment comes? Le","I don't know.  I think for me, it's always been about the man in the arena, the quote from Theodore Roosevelt.  It's about the guy that's in the arena that's gone through everything -- the blood, the sweat, the tears and, in our situation, the competition. I's about the work that you put in and the belief in yourself.  It's not about the doubters or the naysayers or the people who are going to try to talk to you and slander you and bring you down every single day.  It's not about them because they have never been in the arena.  They don't understand. AD, he knows how special he is and when he doesn't, I'll be the first one to tell him how special he is.  He wanted to be here.  I'm happy he wanted to be here, because if he didn't, we wouldn't have a moment like tonight.  That's what it's all about. You put that pressure on yourself when you don't really care what other people think, because what other people think doesn't really matter because they don't understand.

Le,"I think it was the same in Game 2, same thing that we were able to get by with AD's shot, turned the ball over too much.  We couldn't get to the free throw line, and you know, I give credit where credit is due, though. Denver came in and played exceptionally well.  They played better than us, more aggressive than us through three quarters, 36 minutes, but you know, we've got into the penalty in the third quarter with like nine and a half minutes to go and we had some turnovers that led to some easy buckets for them.  We had 16 turnovers for 25 points and put them to the line 29 times.  It's not going to be winning ingredients for us if we continue to do that and we knew that, even after Game 2, we talked about that, trying to assure that.  Got to be better than that Game 4."
2020-09-22,37:15,30.0,0.609,10.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,0,Frank talked about the importance of touching the paint off drives when a team is packing it in like Denver has.  What are some things you can do better in Game 4? Le,"I think offensively we were very good.  At times, we weren't.  I think we just got to do a better job, like Coach was saying, of getting to the paint and once the defense collapses, just finding our guys weak side; if it's a guy that's slashing, through a weak side to the paint or if it's a guy that's spotted up on our side off one of our bigs, getting behind the defense for a lob. So Denver has been a pretty good defensive team all year.  We understand that.  I'm looking forward to seeing our film -- our film session tomorrow and continue to get better."

How do you account for the run you went on? Le","I think it's a bit of both.  I think we played with a lot more energy, and we understand we had 12 minutes left to try to make a game out of it and we were able to do that.  We were able to switch some things up defensively, going zone here, man here, trying to keep them off balance. When you dig yourself a hole like that, every shot that they make and every shot that we miss, feels like the game is collapsing.  So you know, we played some pretty good ball in the fourth quarter, but those first 36 minutes, that hurt us obviously."

You've spent so much time in the bubble talking about police brutality and the relationship of police in the black community and on Tuesday you expressed your condolences towards the officers in Compton who were shot and talked about the need for non-violence.  There's this sort of narrative in this framing that emerges from some people that frames your position in talking about police brutality as something that incites violence against officers, and the L.A. County Sheriff obviously had that kind of implication last week when he asked you to contribute to the reward.  I'm wondering what your reaction is when you hear those two things connected, and did you think it was appropriate for the sheriff to sort of bring that up and bring you into that discussion? Le","I've never in my 35 years ever condoned violence.  Never have.  But I also know what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong and I grew up in an inner city in a black community, in what we call the ""hood,"" the ""ghetto,"" however you want to picture it.  And I've seen a lot of counts, firsthand, of a lot of black people being, you know, I guess racially profiled because of our color, and I've seen it, you know, throughout my whole life.  You know, and I'm not saying that all cops are bad, because I actually throughout high school and things of that nature, I'm around them all the time and they are not all bad. But when you see the videos that's going on and you can see not only my hometown but all over America, you continue to see the acts of violence towards my kind, I can't do nothing but to speak about it and see the common denominator. But not one time have I ever said, you know, let's act violent towards cops.  I just said that what's going on in our community is not okay, and we fear for that and we fear for our lives.  It's something that we go on every single day as a black man and a black woman and a black kid and a black girl, we fear; we fear that moment where we are pulled over or -- I just seen something, I believe yesterday or the day before, of a guy in Wisconsin was renting a house, and the next door neighbor called the police on him, and the police came in the house without a warrant, without anything, and arrested the guy, a black man because he was sitting out on the porch, and if you can't tell me that's not racial profiling, then I don't know what the hell -- or what the hell we are looking at. But I do not condone violence towards anyone, police, black people, white people, anyone of color, anyone not of color, because that's not going to ever make this world or America what we want it to be. So -- and I have zero comment on the sheriff."

The turnovers you had, the turnover issues, is there a common denominator with where those are coming?  Is it something Denver is doing defensively? Le","It's some of the risk passes that we're making, including myself.  I mean, I had five turnovers in the first half and one in the second half, so I understood what I was doing in the first half and made an adjustment.  There are some passes that we have been able to complete throughout this season, but versus Denver we have to be a little bit more careful and make more -- more sound plays with the ball, and protect the ball, because like we always preach, every possession is very important.  When you give up 25 points off 16 turnovers, that's not good.  We did the same thing in Game 2, we had 24 turnovers and luckily it didn't bite us in the butt but it should have. We just got to do a better job of that and it's a conscious effort that not only starts with me because I'm the point guard of the team, and it trickles down to everyone else."

Le","I was just setting a screen and his elbow got high and was able to strike me -- strike me across the jaw.  I don't -- I don't care about flagrant ones or flagrant twos.  I don't want him to come out of the game.  I like the competition.  I don't think it was blatant but I don't know mindset, but I don't think he did it on purpose.  I was okay with it.  You know, went down for a little bit.  Got back up and was ready to play.  I was cool with the ruling.  I was okay with them saying a flagrant one.  I ain't here to fight.

Le,"I knew it was winning time, and Jamal had it going.  The kid is special.  He has an array of shots.  Triple threat from the three, mid-range and also in the paint. For me, it's just trusting my defensive keys.  Trusting my study of film.  Trusting personnel.  And living with the results.  I told my teammate that I had him and everyone else can kind of stay at bay and stay home.  I was able to get a couple stops and we were able to rebound the basketball, which is the most important thing."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,How are you feeling about the type of shots you guys are getting especially when they are packing the paint? Le,"I think at times we're doing a great job.  At certain times, we can do a better job with our spacing, especially on our post-ups.  They are doing a little doubling on the post at times, so we've got to get a better outlet for AD when he is posting up and get the ball swung-swung as quickly as possible to get more looks.  I thought we did a really good job, more importantly, tonight of not turning the ball over.  The thing we talked about in Game 2 and Game 3 is we cannot turn the ball over against this team.  We did a great job of that tonight."

With that management, did it allow you to keep something in reserve to make a move to guard Murray late? Le","Not for me.  I don't reserve any energy.  I'm on the floor, I give it all I got.  If I need a break, I ask for a break.  Coach has done a good job of getting me out throughout the course of the game.  I don't look at it as a reserve tank.  I've got pretty good energy when I'm on the floor all the time.  It's winning time and I don't have a chance or time to be feeling tired.  I'm tired now.  That's when I'm tired, when it's zeros on the clock.  That's when I'm tired.  I'm not tired during the game."

You guys have also been up 3-1 in both of your series and closed them out.  In this game you fixed some issues from Game 3.  What's your level of confidence that you'll be able to take care of this in five games? Le,"It's just about playing to our capability.  Coming out with the game plan and executing it for 48 minutes.  If we do that, we give ourselves a good chance to win."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,"In the starting lineup with Dwight, he made a big impact early.  What was that impact?  And late in the game, what about the smaller lineup? Le","Dwight was a beast.  Gave us opportunities when we missed shots, which as a team, we missed a couple.  AD didn't miss any, but as a team, when we missed a couple shots, he was cleaning glass both offensively and defensively.  Got us put-backs and was able to control the paint.  We know we got smashed in the rebounding category in Game 3, so we wanted to do a better job in that. Dwight brought that physical presence.  It was great for our ballclub. Tonight, late game, Do [Rajon Rondo] was running pick-and-rolls.  I was able to run a couple.  But we just made our free throws.  We made our free throws down the stretch, and that's what closes games out.  You've got to get your stops defensively, make your free throws when you're fouled. And I thought we did that."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,Anthony said he wasn't so happy with the way he played or ended the previous game.  He came out on fire tonight.  What have you learned about him on off days after a game he doesn't love? Le,"See how low his brow is.  If his brow is really low, then you know not to talk to him.  If it's higher, then he's accepted the fact that you're allowed to come into his office and talk to him. Yesterday his brow was very low in this part and no one talked to him.  So we already knew the mindset he was in, and he came out and did it."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,"We saw your posts about protecting Black women.  Specifically for you, what does that actually mean? Le","I think at the end of the day, respect.  You just look at the history of America and the disrespect that Black women have gotten for the last 400 years.  You can't turn a blind eye to that. When I look at my household and see my daughter, who is five on her way to six, my wife and my mom, rest in peace my grandmother, so many Black women have done so many things for me.  Seeing the sacrifices they made, especially my mom when I was growing up.  They were disrespected along the way and it's still like that today. In the case of Breonna Taylor's case, it's just shown once again that the walls of the neighbor is more important than her life. So not only did I want to acknowledge all the queens in this world, all the Black queens in this world, but the ones in my life, the personal ones, too.  I just kind of had a moment yesterday.  I mean, I have a lot of moments, but felt like it was important to let Black women know that you're not alone.  No matter the disrespect or what they may feel, don't stop.  Because that's exactly what they want you guys to do.  They want you guys to stop.  They want you guys not to be as powerful as you guys are, not as strong as you guys are, as determined as you guys are.  They want you all to be at bay.  They want you to accept what's going on.  For sure, I won't allow that. When they are feeling down or feeling like there's no journey for them or gateway to be heard or to be seen or be respected or be accepted, my job is to continue to let them know that they are.  They are important to everything that goes on, not only in America but in the world. Everything that goes on for 24 hours in day, 365 days a year, 366 in a leap year.  That's what it's about."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,Were there any thoughts of not playing? Le,"We didn't talk about that.  One thing, we wanted to be there for our brother, Do.  As much as it's devastating to us, you can only imagine it happening in your backyard. Do being from Louisville,  we knew how tough it had to be on his family and the locals there. No, we didn't discuss that one bit.  But can't say that we were surprised at the verdict.  None of us are surprised at it.  That's what's more devastating, that none of us were surprised at what the outcome was."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,"Speaking of Do, can you talk about how he played tonight? Le","Do has been in a lot of playoff games.  He's won a championship.  He's played at the highest level, and he's someone that we can trust. In the postseason, every possession is so important. When you can have guys that have been in the moments and can understand and also be able to make adjustments on the fly, and know that you can count on them down the stretch, it just makes the team and you individually feel so much more confident in the outcome. Do has been, ever since he got back from injury and we saw this playoff run, he's been exceptional."
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,You've been here 70-plus days -- Le,Thank you.  Reminded me.
2020-09-24,38:21,26.0,0.389,9.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,"Going through these experiences, like Breonna Taylor as a group, how does that change how a team processes something like that versus the way that when these things have happened in the past, how you would deal with it when maybe you weren't all together? Le","I think the best thing is that we have been together.  We're able to see what's going on and be able to bounce things off one another and to be there for one another. This game is so much bigger than just us getting on the floor and running around and calling out screens and running plays and making mistakes and trying to figure out how we can be better the next time.  There's also a big thing called life that's involved in this, too.  And to have, like you said, things that happened in Kenosha, and the Breonna Taylor case and so many other things that are going on in America, as we speak and as we move forward, being around people that you can trust and confide in, be able to talk to, bounce things off and not feel that you have to tackle it by yourself, I think that's very important when you have a support system like that. The best thing that you can have is a close-knit group, because we're together more than we are with our families.  So having that support is pretty amazing. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

Le","Yeah, just, one, getting my breath back underneath me after a hard-fought series against one of most well-coached team I've ever played against in the postseason, one of the most respected teams I've played against. Obviously, you guys know how much I love Mike Malone.  He's incredible.  He's the reason why that team is so damn good.  So I was thinking about that. I was also thinking about some of my teammates who this is their first appearance to the Finals.  Obviously, AD had a lot on my thought process.  This is the reason why I wanted to be a teammate of his and why I brought him here.  I wanted him to see things that he had not seen before in this league.  To be able to come through for him meant a lot for me personally. Then I started thinking about the next opponent. Boston had a few moments in my head.  Miami had a few moments in my head as well.  How challenging that's going to be, whoever wins that series. Then I just started thinking about my journey as well.  All that was just going through my mind as the confetti was on the floor, was coming down, landing on my shoulder and things of that nature.  So hopefully that was a good description."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,Frank said he felt like you played with a chip on your shoulder all year.  What does it mean to this have moment after everything you went through with your first year with the Lakers and after every single obstacle you kept hitting this season and yet you still end up where you were trying to get? Le,"For me personally, the job is not done.  But it's great to hit moments throughout the course of a journey and appreciate that.  This is all part of the process, but the job is not done for me personally. For us as a franchise, I'm extremely proud to be a part of this franchise getting back to where it belongs, and that's playing for championships and competing for championships and representing the Western Conference in the championships. This is what I came here for. I heard all the conversations and everything that was said about why did I decide to come to L.A -- the reason I came to L.A., it was not about basketball.  All those conversations, just naysayers and things of that nature.  I understood that, with the season I had last year and my injury, it just gave them more sticks and more wood to throw in the fire to continue to say the things that they would say about me.  But it never stopped my journey and never stopped my mindset and never stopped by goa. I'm happy, like I said, and proud of this organization and proud of my teammates and I'm proud of the coaching staff, the front office and our ownership as well at this very moment today."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"You mentioned getting the Lakers back to the Finals.  Last time they got there, Game 6 Western Conference Finals, 2010, Kobe goes for 37, hits all those dagger jumpers in the fourth.  How do you process your emotions all year about Kobe, and as this run has continued, wearing the purple and gold, how that's all sat in your mind? Le","I mean, every time you put on purple and gold, you think about his legacy.  You think about him and about what he meant to this franchise for 20-plus years, and what he stood for both on the floor and off the floor.  What he demanded out of his teammates and what he demanded out of himself. We have some similarities in that sense. Our games are different, but as far as our mindset and our drive to want to be the best and our drive to not lose -- sometimes you're going to lose games, but that drive to always want to be victorious, it stops you from sleeping.  And sometimes you put certain things -- you sacrifice a lot of things.  You sacrifice your family at times because you're so driven to be so great that other things fall by the wayside at times. So I understand that.  I'm one of the few that can understand the mindset that he played with and the journey from high school to the NBA. It's just a thing that I carry with me, like I said, every time I decide at one point in that locker room before the game when I throw that jersey on."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,Do you find yourself savoring these moments more than when you were younger? Le,"I don't, unfortunately.  I wish I did.  They happen so fast and my mind is still so locked in on the journey that it's hard for me to take in and appreciate what we just accomplished. Just how I've always been. I always say that when I'm done playing the game, hopefully I look back on it and enjoy it -- and hopefully I will.  Hopefully I can, because I don't think I enjoy it enough when I'm in it because I'm so engulfed in the process until the final call. But I'm so damn proud of this team and where we are right now up until this day."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"The nature of your accomplishments has had you compared to the greats of the game for a long time, but you've insisted, ""I'm my own guy and it's my own story.""  What about the fact that you didn't just stay on the first team you played with, first city; you go to Miami, you go to L.A.  What has that meant to you to blaze your own trail as a superstar or whatever? Le","I don't know, I've never looked at it that way.  I've never said, OK, I want to cast myself as a superstar or whatever the case may be.  I just want to travel my own journey, because it is my journey. I've appreciated everything that's happened along the way.  I mean, throughout -- the ups, the downs, the ups on the court, the downs on the court, the wins and losses. But I've been able to, I guess as Frank Sinatra would say, I did it my way.  At the end of the day and at the end of my career, I just hope that I inspire enough people to want to play the game the right way, and have that respect from all the opponents that I played against, all the teams that I played against and the organizations that I play for.  Because at the end of the day, I mean, that's all you have, is your respect."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,The Finals have been basically the LeBron James Invitational for the last decade.  What were you doing at this time last year and how did that affect your continued determination to get back here? Le,"Well, it all depends what game you were talking about.  There were a couple games where I was at home.  There was one or two games where I was in Cabo and a couple games where I was at a hookah lounge during the Finals last year.  That's the truth.  I wasn't smoking hookah, but I was there."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,Was the game on or no? Le,"Absolutely.  I wouldn't have went.  The game was on in Cabo, the game was on in my house and at the hookah lounge.  I watched every single minute of the games until they stopped.  I actually watched every single postseason game last year.  I think I told David that; I watched every single postseason game. Part of me, I'm just a fan of the game.  I love the sport.  I love the competitive nature.  I love the playoffs. And then, also, of saying like, oh, I wish I was in this moment, what would I have done at that moment? What play would I have made in that moment if I was out there? So yes, I didn't miss a game.  I didn't miss one game.  Even on vacation, I didn't miss a game.  My wife didn't like it, but she'll be OK (smiling)."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"In the fourth quarter, where is your head at in terms of deciding this thing is not going to a Game 6? Le","I've always had the mindset that in a close-out game for me personally, I'm just as desperate as the team that we are trying to close out.  I don't want to play another game.  And if we are in a position where we can win that game, that's just my mindset. Does it always go that route?  No, because I don't believe I'm undefeated.  I'm not undefeated in close-out games.  My mindset is that I do not -- if we have played well enough and we are in the fourth quarter and we have a chance to win, I do not want to play another game.  I mean, I love the game, but I do not want to play another game.  That's always been my mindset.  I want to be just as desperate as my opponent, just as desperate as the other team, the player that I'm lined up against, the coaching staff that's on the other side.  It's just who I am.  It's just a mindset I'm able to link into at that very moment."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"LeBron, you said that you thought about AD and wanting to show him something that he has never seen before.  What has he meant to you this season?  Obviously, you guys are very close, but to go through this year with him, how have you needed him? Le","I guess it was a very, very, very, very long time ago, when I was 27, like a long-ass time ago when I was 27 in this league.  I just wanted to put myself kind of in his position.  Sometimes what I would be thinking at that age and if I was with someone in the later stage of their career, I just don't want to let them down.  And I'm not even talking on the floor, because there's things that sometimes they go in, they don't go in. But as far as, I don't want to say a role model, but someone that holds myself to a higher standard as far as character.  I don't want to let them down.  And then, it's funny because it's kind of rubbed off on me as well because he doesn't want to let me down. I don't know, you've seen the movie Step Brothers before, right?  Well, there it is."

2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Alex Caruso, how has he grown and how much resolve has he shown? Le","I think Alex Caruso is a true definition of when opportunity meets preparation.  He's been preparing for this moment for a long time and he just needed opportunity. Luke [Walton] gave him an opportunity last year, and now Coach Vogel and our coaching staff are giving him an opportunity on a bigger stage.  He's just taking full advantage of that and just full stride.  He's just gotten better and better every single minute he's on the floor. He's still learning.  Every game is still a learning experience for him because he's so new to the NBA.  He played a lot of his minutes over the course of his early stages in the G League. But first time I saw him, and seeing him in some of our practices, it wasn't the sneaky athleticism.  It was the way that he defended and how cerebral he played the game. I gravitate toward players like that right away, because the game, everybody talks about the physical side and how high you can jump and how fast you can run and all those things.  But the mental side is what gets you to the next level.  You know, I saw that from A.C. and he continues to learn.  He's just been great for us."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"Your track record speaks for itself, and there's a lot of talent and experience with your teammates.  Given this is Frank's first year what jumped out of how he managed everything, not just this group, but all the unique challenges this year? Le","He's been great.  He's been unbelievable.  I mean, we've faced, it's been a crazy obstacle course for our franchise this whole year.  I'm not going to sit here and give all the details, but you guys, everyone can go back and just see from the start of the season all the way up until now what we've gone through as a team.  He's been able to manage it the whole time.  Bringing in guys, losing guys.  He's just always been the anchor, and our coaching staff has been right behind him.  I can't say anything more than that. Just happy to be on the floor to kind of be his coach on the floor and just command to my teammates the same message that he's given to me and be an extension of his mind.  It's been great."
2020-09-26,40:01,38.0,0.6,16.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1,"In the postgame ceremony, you said how tough it is to get to the Finals.  You've now done it nine times over the last 10 years.  How have you been able to have that type of longevity, and how did this ceremony feel this year without fans? Le","One, I've taken care of my body.  I've been available to my teammates.  That's one.  I sleep.  I try to get as much sleep as I can.  I think there's no better recovery than sleep.  And then I've never cheated the game as well.  I've put so much work into my craft, so much work into the game.  I think you add on to the fact that I've played with some great teammates and some great coaching staffs, from T-Lue and his coaching staff to Erik Spoelstra and his coaching staff, and now this coaching staff with Frank Vogel. I'm blessed.  I'm truly blessed.  They have all allowed me to be me.  They have allowed me to go out and do the things that I do on the floor.  Use my mind, my play and be able to command my teammates the way I do.  It's put me in position to be able to, like you said, be in the Finals nine out of 10 years. To answer your second question, everything is different.  It's 2020.  Nothing feels the same.  Everything is different.  So the ceremony is different.  The one thing I can say, I wish we were in Staples Center tonight with our fans, with our Laker faithful, because they deserve this as much as we do because they went through the last so many years of not being in a postseason run, feeling like their franchise would never get back to this moment.  But they continued to stay faithful.  It would have been great to celebrate with them tonight. So hopefully we can continue to give them something to smile about in the next round, as well. That's what our mindset is. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

What allows you guys to have success like that over a sustained period of time, a run like that? Le","Paying attention to detail.  I don't think in the beginning that we were physical enough.  You have to get a feel for how hard Miami plays.  I think they smacked us in the mouth, and we got a sense of that.  And so we knew how hard we had to play if we wanted to try to make it a game. You know, from that moment when it was 23-10, we started to play to our capabilities.  We started flying around.  We started getting defensive stops.  We started sharing the ball a lot better offensively and just got into a really good groove."

Was there any advice you gave him, and to see him perform like that, what do you feel about that? Le","I don't feel anything.  I expect it out of him.  Didn't need to give him no advice.  We've been preparing for this moment all season.  He's been preparing for this moment all season.  I'm happy to be on the same floor with him and in the same uniform.

I've been preparing for this moment for quite a while.  Fans, no fans, the inner challenge for myself and the way I prepare myself, it felt amazing to be playing in the Finals once again."
2020-09-30,36:24,25.0,0.529,13.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"You've seen plenty of times over the years where if one team has a bunch of injuries, the other team floats a little bit and doesn't come at them as hard.  How do you make sure that you guys don't do that in Game 2? Le",We've got so much more work to do.  The job is not done.  We're not satisfied with winning one game.  It's that simple.
2020-09-30,36:24,25.0,0.529,13.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"There was a few times where you guys got up big, and there was a lot of celebrating going on, and I see sometimes you had to rein it in a little bit.  In your experience, what have you seen in the past that got you to the point where you felt like sometimes you need to say, okay, let's keep it on task? Le","The best teacher in life is experience. I've experienced moments in my career where you have all the momentum in the world and you felt like you had the game under control, and one play here or one play there could change the course of a series or change the course of a game. One in particular that always rings home for me is Game 2 of the 2011 Finals in Miami versus Dallas.  D-Wade hits a three right by their bench.  I believe it put us up either 13 or 17.  From that moment on, Dallas went on a hell of a run and finished it off with a Dirk Nowitzki left-hand layup to steal that game.  That (expletive) burns me to this day. I always talk about the best teacher in life is experience, and I've experienced a lot.  That's what prompts me to be who I am today, is being able to have those experiences."

Were you already in that frame of mind during this game? Le","Yeah, absolutely.  I think you can learn so much more from a win than you can in a loss.  I can't wait for tomorrow for us to get back together and watch the film and see ways we can be better and see some of the breakdowns that we had, especially in that fourth quarter, especially in that first six minutes of the first quarter where we can be so much better defensively and also so much better offensively. So I can't wait.  I'm extremely amped up about watching the film with our ballclub tomorrow.  I'm going to watch some tonight obviously by myself, but I'm looking forward to getting together as a group tomorrow."
2020-09-30,36:24,25.0,0.529,13.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1,"Teams have spent your whole career trying to keep you out of the paint, and you can say the same thing this season about AD.  What are some of the ways that you guys are still always seemingly able to get to the rim and still able to finish? Le","Because we have great spacing and great shooters.  KCP, Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris, a list of guys that can spread the floor, it allows myself and AD to be able to do the things that we do in the interior. We try to mix up our game, too.  We try to mix it in in the interior and the exterior.  But when you have guys that could space the floor like we have, it allows us to do some of the things that we do in the paint."

I've never called him that.  We've never called him that.  We only call him Do.  So that would be a Do question. But you know, just having him in this moment, having him on our side, and I think he mentioned yesterday or whenever Media Day was for the Finals, you just don't -- you never know.  You don't get these moments a lot.  It's been over a decade since he's been in the Finals.  I think he's just cherishing the moment, but also just playing the game that he loves to play -- the cerebral way, the determined way, the championship way, as he's been playing for quite a while now.

You were drafted the next year.  You and AD, first time Lakers teammates have done that since then.  Wondered your thoughts on the Kobe-Shaq dynamic and what it's like going through a game like today with AD, especially at a similar level of efficiency. Le","You know, obviously being in high school, watching the Kobe-Shaq duo was the most dominant duo that I have personally seen in my life from a basketball perspective.  Obviously we knew the force that Shaq brought to the table, but the elegance and force that Kobe played with, as well. They were very dominant in what they did on the floor, on both sides of the floor.  So to be in the conversation with those two guys, myself and Anthony, myself and AD -- he's going to kill me -- myself and AD, is just very humbling, because I know I grew up watching those guys.  I grew up admiring Kobe; obviously, a kid coming straight out of high school.  Admired that, as a kid when I was young, and obviously got the opportunity.  And the force that Shaq played with.  It's very humbling that we can be even mentioned with those greats."
2020-10-02,39:09,33.0,0.56,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,"AD and Frank indicated that even though it's a win, they were not totally happy with how things went defensively, especially Frank had mentioned that.  Do you agree, and if so, what concerns you? Le","I definitely agree.  Myself, Coach and AD were not happy with our defensive presence tonight.  We know we can be a lot better and we're just, myself and AD, we're not satisfied with just the win.  We want to be great.  We want to be great, as close to 48 minutes as possible. I know I said it after Game 1, but I'm extremely excited to watch the film tomorrow, as well as a group, to see ways we can be better.  We're playing against a very dangerous team in Miami, where they have five guys on the floor that's a threat, as they have shown tonight. So we have to continue to stay on our P's and Q's and cross our T's and dot our I's throughout the course of a game, and if we have a breakdown, being able to cover for one another.  But they do a great job of putting your defense in positions that you may not be accustomed to. We definitely were not happy with our performance defensively tonight. Hopefully we can be -- well, we know, not hopefully, we know we can be better in Game 3."
2020-10-02,39:09,33.0,0.56,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,"Shaq's a big post presence, a five as much as a five can be.  Kobe, perimeter, all that.  You and AD seem to have elements maybe of a bit of both of their games.  I don't know if you would agree with that, but if you do, could you describe how maybe both of you are a bit of a hybrid of what those guys brought to the court? Le","Well, I guess if you look in the sense of the size and the power and the speed that Shaq at his size played with, you could look at my game throughout the course of my career and say that.  And then you look at the elegance and the ability to shoot the ball and the ability to play in the paint as well as post up and get to the perimeter, I guess you can say that you can have some of AD's game that could compare to Kobe's game in that sense. Obviously, all four of us are all different positions.  Kobe was a natural 2-guard.  I'm kind of a, I don't know, whatever position.  Shaq is a center. AD is kind of a hybrid, as well.  But I guess all four of us, we have a winning mentality and we just tried to make enough plays out on the floor throughout the course of the game that would benefit not only ourselves individually but for the most important thing, for the better of the team. I can't even believe I'm up here talking about myself and AD with Kobe and Shaq."
2020-10-02,39:09,33.0,0.56,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,"After the Heat timeout with UD, it seemed like there was a turn in momentum and they started attacking aggressively.  What do you know about UD that makes him impactful to a bench of players like that, even though he himself is not playing in the game? Le","Check his résumé.  It's that simple.  I mean, he's put in the work.  He's been there through everything that the Heat franchise has seen.  He's seen it all, done it all.  Just check his résumé.  There's not many guys that talk about it and also be about it, and he's one of them.  If you want to be in the foxhole, that's somebody you want to be in the foxhole with."
2020-10-02,39:09,33.0,0.56,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,"You used the word ""force"" probably six or seven times in the first two answers today.  How important has your team's ability to play with force made a difference in these first two games? Le","I think I was talking about force because Shaq's name came up.  There's no way that you can talk about Shaq and not have that word come up.  From the team's perspective, I think we've done a good job of, one, not turning the ball over, but also still being able to play with force, as you would say.  Play with tempo offensively, get good looks. Get good looks that we like and, make or miss, live with the results.  We have to play with that type of force defensively, but also from the cerebral side, as well.  Thinking the game a little bit better as they are going through their offense and their pace and their force, as well.  We've got to be a lot better obviously on that side."
2020-10-02,39:09,33.0,0.56,9.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,"When you guys advanced past Denver, Frank was talking about the relationship he has with you, and he said that the buy-in that you had with him as a coach and the immediacy of that buy-in did a lot for this team and where you are right now.  What was it about Frank that gave that you immediate buy-in and that you gravitated toward? Le","For one, from a competitive standpoint, going against Frank's teams in Indiana when we had our battles and I was in Miami, you understood how well those teams were coached.  It starts with the head coach, and the players are an extension of the head coach. So I had that memory of that, just battling those Indiana Pacers teams.  And then for me, I've always been a coachable player throughout my whole life.  I've played for multiple coaches and I've always been a coachable player. So you know, the respect, more importantly, he's the head coach.  The head coach should have the respect from all his players, no matter who you are, if you're really serious about trying to make an impact or really trying to do something special.  It was just that simple for me personally. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,"Was there anything that you noticed in that first quarter about just the general way the team was playing and the turnovers that surprised you, and how did that play out for the rest of the game? Le","We know that we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They are very active defensively.  It starts with myself, being the starting point guard of the team, having five first-half turnovers, eight total for the game. Can't do that, obviously, because it gives them more possessions and doesn't allow us to set our defense.  They are really, really good offensively, so you just can't turn the ball over against that team. I take full responsibility for that."
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,You've had a 40-point triple-double in the Finals before.  Just wondered what you thought of Jimmy's effort tonight and how you need to defend him better or differently in Game 4. Le,I thought Jimmy was phenomenal.  He did everything that they needed him to do tonight and he came through big time in a big-time game.  We'll watch film and see ways we can be better going into Game 4.  But I thought he was great.
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,Anthony got into foul trouble early and had trouble getting going.  What did you see happening with him? Le,"I mean, you just said it, he got into some foul trouble.  You know, they even -- one of the shots he made when he had four fouls, they still tried to slide underneath him and get him a fifth in the third.  I think the foul trouble made him a little passive, because he wanted to be out on the floor but he couldn't be his aggressive self offensively and defensively.  I think the fouls slowed him down a lot tonight."
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,"Despite seemingly Miami controlling the action, holding the lead for most of the start of the game, you guys took a lead around nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter.  From there on, what do you think allowed them to separate from you guys? Le","They continued to make shots, and we had some turnovers.  We didn't make shots.  They came out and executed after we took the lead.  Jimmy, like I said, he had his hand on all those plays pretty much. Obviously, we have to do a better job of that coming down the stretch.  But I like our fight tonight, even as poorly as I believe we played."
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,"You guys obviously had a chance to take a 3-0 lead.  Are you concerned about giving Miami a breath of fresh air?  And with the possibility of Bam returning in the next game, do you feel like an opportunity missed that way? Le","When you have an opportunity and you don't make the most of it, then you come back the next time.  I mean, it's not like the series was over if we won tonight.  We know for sure that Miami is never going to quit, no matter if we won tonight and they go into a Game 4, 3-0.  I know how resilient that bunch is and how resilient that coaching staff is and their franchise.  I don't ever feel like we let our guard down.  Also, I don't feel like we're concerned.  We're not concerned.  We know we can play a lot better.  We have another opportunity to take a commanding lead on Tuesday.  You relish that opportunity."
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,"When you guys have lost games this postseason, you've responded very well.  What is it about this group that's handled quick adjustments that has bounced back from losses so well in these playoffs? Le","We learn from our mistakes pretty quick.  You know, obviously right now with the games being every other day pretty much, it's the film room.  It's the film room and it's how well we can make adjustments from the film and take it to the floor, and we have done a great job throughout this postseason.  So we are going to definitely have to do that because we're playing against a very, very, very, very good team.  We have to learn from our mistakes and be better on Tuesday."
2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,"It's usually pretty fun when you and Jimmy play against each other over the years.  Would you say that you enjoy playing against him?  You respect playing against him?  Where is your level and emotions toward him as you go against him over and over, different teams, different cities? Le","Love it.  Love it.  One of the best competitors we have in our game.  We love that opportunity.  For me personally, I don't know how many more opportunities I'm going to have, so to be able to go against a fierce competitor like that is something I'll look back on when I'm done playing.  I'll miss those moments."

2020-10-04,39:13,25.0,0.563,10.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,0,Would you say tonight's loss was more about effort or execution or a combination of the two? Le,"I just think we can be better, obviously.  I don't think we started the game defensively in tune, and then offensively taking care of the ball.  Like I said, we had some careless turnovers.  It starts with me, like I said, and I take full responsibility for that.  I'll be a lot better on Tuesday with that, understanding that they are very good with their hands.  They are very good with the stripping.  You can't allow this team to have extra possessions.  You can't turn the ball over at that high a rate, especially at this point in the season, as well. I'll be a lot better with the security of the ball and the turnovers and things of that nature.  We as a team will be a lot better defensively with our game plan.

2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"Just wanted to ask you about KCP down the stretch.  You grabbed a rebound off Jimmy's miss, pushed in transition, see him in the corner.  All the teammates you've had, you know which guys are going to be capable for those moments in a Finals game.  What do you think of his effort overall? Le","At the end of the day, if you're on the floor at crunch time, then I believe in you.  Whoever is out on the floor with me, I believe can make plays, and tonight was a case in point of KCP.  Stays ready.  He works on his craft.  Like you said, that three in front of their bench was a huge three, and obviously the drive at the end of the shot clock was two big back-to-back plays in the fourth quarter, where we needed to continue to score versus this team."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"I think it was after Game 2 that you made the comment that it's not just enough to win the game, you guys want to be great.  This game was one where defensively you were great, and then there was a lot of sloppiness early offensively with the turnovers.  I'm just wondering if there's a certain point where you stop striving for that winning in a great way, and it's just enough to get the wins?  Or is that not until the fourth win? Le","It's kind of two different things, two different points you're making.  You never stop striving to be perfect or be great.  And you know that a perfect game is not going to happen, but that don't mean you still don't strive to be as great as you can be every night. Now, every game has its own adjustments and things of that nature, and tonight was one of those games where we had to win on the defensive end and make some timely shots.  But I think when you start thinking like, okay, well, I can't be great tonight or we can't be great tonight, okay, we just have to figure it out, then you sell yourself short.  Me personally, I would never do that as long as I lace them up and put on a uniform.  But I love what we did tonight."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"You guys took a five-point lead to the fourth quarter and won the game, which made you as a team 56-0 this season taking a lead into the fourth.  What does that say about the makeup of your team, and do you take any pride in being on a team that can possess that stat? Le","I think the fourth quarter, obviously it's winning time.  You've got 12 minutes to buckle down defensively with the lead, kind of hold that lead, and then you have to execute offensively.  Obviously, I didn't know the stat coming into tonight.  But for us, that's just the mindset.  We've got 12 minutes.  If we have the lead, it's our job to outscore the opponent or to hold them to [as many] points as us, which is the same exact thing, because if we win the quarter, we win the game. That's kind of been our mindset all year long."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"I know you talked about AD's great games and that that's who AD is, but in the last two days, from where he sort of told us after Game 3 he felt like he could have been more aggressive, to the guy he was after hitting that shot, 39 seconds left, beating his chest, what did you see in him getting back to that place where he be the player that he can be? Le","He's a big shot-maker late in the shot clock, early in the shot clock, fourth quarter, first quarter, everything in between.  It was just a great set up by Do [Rajon Rondo].  The possession before that, Do was able to fake it like he was going back to him, carry himself into the lane and get a layup.  And then the very next possession, he was able to find him and AD just kind of stared at the shot clock, knew it was late in the shot clock and obviously trusted his shot that he works on consistently. So big-time shot, big-time play for our team to be able to put the game away."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"This game, being tied back and forth the entire time, came down to moments of truth.  You guys won more than they did at the end of the day.  When AD hits that shot, and you're doing the Ric Flair and screaming, is there a different kind of satisfaction, when y'all are so tight all night long and you have a breakthrough at that point? Le","You kind of know momentum plays and momentum shots, the score and the time, what's going on within the last few possessions.  They were going back and forth with us, and we were going back and forth with them.  Duncan Robinson hits one off the glass at the end of the shot clock for a three.  Bam hits one off the glass right there before that we thought possibly went out; obviously it didn't count.  Herro hit some big shots.  Me and Do had a clean rebound, we're both going for it and we smash each other in the paint.  They kick it out to Jae Crowder and he hits a shot. To be able to get some stops and then make a timely shot, up six, you know if you make that shot, that three to put you up nine at that point in time of the game, then you know that you want to get one more stop obviously, but you have the time on your side because it's a three-possession game with 39 seconds.  Most veteran ballclubs will be able to survive that. Just a big-time play, big-time moment not only for AD but for our ballclub and our franchise."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"What does an extra day of rest mean in a very physical series like this, and does it matter more to you now than it used to? Le","No.  I mean, for me, it doesn't matter.  I can go every other day if that's the case.  But I'm going to take full advantage of it.  Gives me an opportunity to continue to get my body right, my mind, everything in between.  I'll take full advantage of it, but it does nothing for me besides just getting a little extra day -- I guess it does.  I guess it does do some, but it's not needed for me personally."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"I believe it's like the third game of this series where you guys have called for a challenge in the first half.  You got it overturned, the right call.  How do you weigh the pros and cons of doing it so early? Le","There's certain momentum plays throughout the first half.  There's a certain rhythm that you have either offensively or defensively that if that call is made correctly, then you continue to stay in that zone.  You continue to stay in that rhythm.  And if the call is wrong, it can throw you off of your rhythm. So we've wanted to challenge some things in the first half that we just felt like, okay, even if we were right, maybe that's not the time; we've still got our rhythm, we're good, whatever the case may be.  But we felt like in that particular moment, we were playing some really good basketball.  We were defending at a high level, and we knew for sure, we knew 100 percent, because I was guarding the ball, I knew for sure I didn't touch the ball.  Herro tried to float it over me and it hit the backboard, then hit the wire. Coach is always kind of like, you know, 50/50 about it, and obviously as a player on the floor, you hate to tell your coach to challenge when you're not 100 percent.  But I was for sure 100 percent about that play."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"You mentioned the fourth quarter being winning time.  You played just about every second of the fourth quarter in this series.  Given the score, are you predetermined you're going to play all 12 minutes?  And what is it about the fourth quarter and your sense of urgency that might be a little different than the previous three quarters? Le","For me, I mean, at this point in the season, I don't care about rest.  I really don't.  I don't care about sleep.  I don't care about resting throughout the game.  Obviously, I come out of the game.  Coach has a rhythm and rotation that we live by and we go by.  But I don't care about resting because I can rest in a week, max, if it happens to go there.  I could rest for a month straight, which I won't do because of who I am; you guys know that.  But I can rest then.  I can sleep eight hours and get up and eat and then go right back to sleep if I want to."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,KCP and Markieff both talked about a text that you sent that this was a must-win game.  What was it about today that prompted you to do that? Le,"When I woke up from my nap this morning after our team meeting, I just felt that.  I felt that vibe.  I felt that pressure.  I felt like for me personally, this was one of the biggest games of my career.  I just wanted to relay that message to my teammates, the type of zone I was in, the type of moment it was, and the kind of team we were playing against.  After the Game 3 win, that confidence they had, the confidence they still have even after tonight's loss.  They are just a gritty, so damn-well-coached team. I feel like if we're going to be a championship ballclub, if we want to really be a championship team, that we got to have that same grit and that same attitude.  It was my mindset.  I'm still in it.  You can see my mind kind of working right now."
2020-10-06,38:38,28.0,0.5,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1,"Anthony's versatility on defense is a weapon that allowed Frank to make the switch and say he can start possessions on Butler.  AD's ability to do that, and still get back to protect the rim and to still deter shots, is it kind of unmatched? Le","Yeah, that's why he's the Defensive Player of the Year.  We said that all year.  His ability to play one through five, guard anybody on the floor, take the challenge, not only guard on the perimeter, continue to protect the paint.  Guards drive on him.  It's hard to score on him.  You see how high Herro threw that ball up?  It went in, but he had to throw that thing up to the skyscrapers, right?  That guy can do everything defensively.  Guarding the ball, guard the post, slide his feet with guards, contest, can body up with bigs.  I mean, need I say more?"

I'm wondering, how much have you come to enjoy the adjustment game to game that you have to make when you're in the playoffs, against good teams with good coaches that you know? Le","I think that's the best part.  That's the best part.  I get so excited -- like right now, I'm excited about our meeting tomorrow watching film and breaking that down and seeing things that we can do better.  Seeing things that we did do well.  Thinking about the adjustments that they possibly or will do, because I know Spo going into Game 5.  That's the best part about it.  It's a chess match. When you get to this point in your career, having your mind at a high level is so much more than the physical because we're all -- at this point, we're all great players.  We're all here for a reason.  We're in the Finals, Both conferences, anybody that is on the floor, they are on the floor for a reason. To be able to think through the game and understand and see the adjustments and try to make plays before plays even seem like they are going to be possible, that's the best part for me personally.

2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,What's your Finals experience over the years taught you about how to respond to a game like this and how to put that out to the rest of your teammates? Le,"I mean for me, I've always stayed even keeled.  You know, throughout the highs, throughout the lows, you stay even keeled and get better with the process.  You stay in the moment, which I am, and understanding that we can be better. And how we make the adjustments and how we learn from tonight, tomorrow in our film session and when we get together and prepare ourselves for Sunday, will show the difference."
2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"I was wondering if you could take us through that last minute of the game, the ups and downs, and your mentality when you were driving in. Frank described it as you were ready to take on the whole team and then you saw Danny open at the top? Le","Obviously it was back and forth, big play after big play.  A couple, you know, questionable calls that swayed their way and put Jimmy to the free-throw line.  Obviously, we can't do that.  He's been damn near perfect at the free-throw line in the series. We just needed to get one stop.  We felt like if we could get one stop, we could do something on the offensive end.  But we got a hell of a look.  We got a hell of a look to win the game, to win the series.  Didn't go down.  And then we got the offensive rebound, we turned the ball over.  I thought we had a lot more time than I think we even thought after the offensive rebound, and a pass wasn't executed as we would like. But we've got to be better.  We've just got to be better in Game 6 and close the series."
2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,You've obviously been on the other side of this coming back from a 3-1 deficit.  Is there something about that experience that helps you understand what it will take to slam the door on Miami now that it's been somewhat left ajar for them? Le,"Listen, at the end of the day, you don't predetermine anything and you take the game as it's going and you play. You play each quarter, you play each possession and you live with the results.  You don't think about what could happen at the end of the game and things of that nature.  You don't get caught up in the aftermath.  You have to live in the moment and prepare yourself each and every possession, because if you start to wander and your mind starts to go, you make a mistake.  One thing about this team that we are playing, they make you pay for every mistake.  It's the same as when I was playing against Golden State all those years, you make a mistake, they make you pay.  So we have to understand that."
2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"Two vets, Danny and Markieff were involved in that play.  Is that a situation where you talk to them after a game like this or do you feel they have experience and they kind of know what it is and they will come ready for Game 6? Le","I mean, they’re vets.  They’re vets.  I don't think too much need to be said to them.  I believe they will be much better and I'm not saying they even played bad tonight.  Everybody in the lineup tonight that got minutes gave the effort.  We just had some mental breakdowns at times, and they make you pay for it, like I said.  We've got to look at the film tomorrow and see how we can be better."
2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"From I think 2:52 remaining to 0:46 remaining, you and Jimmy went back and forth; there was six straight possessions where one of you scored for your team.  And even with the questionable calls, you talked about Jimmy and his competitive nature, something that you relish.  Can you take us inside what it's like being in that battle with the game on the line? Le","That's the beauty of the game, being able to compete at the highest level.  You take those opportunities and you live in the moment.  You're trying to make plays for your team and be successful on both ends, and we were both just trying to do that and trying to will our team to a victory.  You know, he was able to make one more play than I was able to make tonight and come away with a victory."
2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"Talking about calls, not trying to get you in trouble, but just from your vantage point on the last foul that got Jimmy to the line, AD looked like he went straight up.  What did you see from your vantage point?  I know you didn't have a challenge but what was it like from your view. Le","I thought AD made a heck of a play at the rim.  I felt he was chest to chest with Jimmy, making him change the trajectory of his shot and the call didn't go our way. I felt like, you know, at that point in time, I think it was a tough call, but they made the call.  We still had an opportunity to win. But we feel like, you know, with AD and with him at the rim and him contesting things like that, it could have swayed our way, but it didn't."
2020-10-09,41:51,40.0,0.714,13.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0,"You talk about focus being so crucial down the stretch, AD seemed to hurt that left foot a little bit.  For you, is it tough in that moment when you're trying to figure out, you know, what can I do with him, what can't I do with him, as he's trying to fight through that? Le","Well, if he's on the floor – I mean he's a warrior, man.  Just him being out there, hobbled, just brings a lot more confidence to myself and our team.  We know the nicks and bumps and bruises he's played through throughout the whole season.  We have to pick it up for him and pick it up for any one of our brothers if they are hobbling or lobbying or not at their full strength.  Just the makeup of our brotherhood."

Tonight Danny got a great look but didn't make it.  How do you live with make or miss at this stage of a season to determine winning and losing when you've put so much into it? Le","I've always played the game the same way since I was a kid and I've had success doing it. And I won't let a play here or a play there change my outlook on the game and how I play the game.  I mean, if you just look at the play, I was able to draw two defenders below the free-throw line and find one of our shooters at the top of the key for a wide open three to win a championship.  I trusted him, we trusted him, and it just didn't go.  You live with that.  You live with that. It's one of the best shots that we could have got, I feel, in that fourth quarter, especially down the stretch with two guys on me, Duncan Robinson and Jimmy, and Danny had a hell of a look.  It just didn't go down.  I know he wish he can have it again.  I wish I could make a better pass.  You know, but you just live with it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,"Three seasons ago after you beat Toronto, you told Cleveland.com that you didn't have anything left to prove when you were asked what you have left to prove. I wanted to know if that's changed over the past three years.  Did you feel you had something to prove, and why is this one so important for you? Le","I think personally thinking I have something to prove fuels me.  It fueled me over this last year and a half since the injury.  It fueled me because no matter what I've done in my career to this point, there's still little rumblings of doubt or comparing me to the history of the game and has he done this, has he done that. So having that in my head, having that in my mind, saying to myself, why not still have something to prove, I think it fuels me."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,"All the circumstances surrounding this one, being in Orlando, having a four-and-a-half-month hiatus away from family, everything going on in the country, how does that add context to this fourth ring versus the other three? Le","I think they are all special in their own right.  They all have their obstacles, things that went on throughout the course of the year, both on and off the floor. But one is not less than the other, because when you're able to put yourself in this position to be able to win a championship, first thing you start to think about is how much work you've put in over the course of the year.  How much you've sacrificed, how much you've dedicated to the game and to your craft.  That's always been the most fulfilling thing for me, besides seeing my teammates as happy as they are.  Being able to know that you can put the work in, literally trust the process, live about the process and then see the results.  I think not only from a basketball player, but from everybody, whatever craft, whatever workspace you're in, to be able to put the work in and live along the process and build along the process and be able to see results, I think we all live for that moment."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,"Could you sense with the mental wear of the bubble that it was getting to other teams?  And in the last few days, was there kind of a weird feeling of you're reaching not just possibly winning a championship but reaching the end of this journey?  Did that feel different than the other title runs? Le","To answer your first question, with so much going on inside the bubble and everything and us going into the unknown, it was kind of hard for me personally -- once I got inside here, I said, okay, this is my mission: I want to win a championship; this is why I'm here.  It was hard for me to focus on other teams and what other players were feeling.  I didn't engage in that.  I didn't look for it.  I wanted to keep my energy in the right space. And over the last couple days, you definitely thought about it.  You thought about just being here, how successful it is.  I commend Adam Silver and the NBA, Michele Roberts, Chris Paul and everybody at the NBPA to make this happen and to make this work.  I think we can all say from the social injustice conversations, the voter suppression, police brutality, to have this platform, have our players be able to unite like that, it's something that you will miss.  You will think back on it. I think one of the biggest things, besides the social injustice, all the things I mentioned, we had zero positive tests.  We had zero positives tests for as long as we were here, 90-some days, 95 days maybe for myself.  I had a little calendar I was checking off.  But on a serious note, no positive tests.  That's a success for everybody that was involved."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,What about this partnership that you have with Anthony makes it particularly special to you? Le,"I can't really explain it.  There's just certain things you just know.  And any type of relationship, you kind of just feel, you know that vibe.  You have that respect.  You have that drive.  Sometimes you can't explain what links you with somebody, and then it's that organic. Sometimes, you don't even try to explain it.  You guys ask me about my relationship with AD, the first thing I think about is the respect, the no ego, the challenging each other.  We want each other to be better than actually ourselves.  I want AD to be better than me.  AD want me to be better than him.  Every single night, every single day.  And we challenge ourselves.  I think that's a part of it."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,"With about three minutes left, you looked over and you saw Anthony sitting there, probably the realization of what you guys accomplished hitting him for the first time.  I'm wondering, how much of that reminded you of 2012 for you?  And what did that first title do for your career and what can this do for AD moving forward? Le","It definitely reminded me of it, just the excitement, the ""I can't believe this.""   I definitely saw myself, 27 LeBron, 27 AD.  I definitely saw myself in that. And what it did for me in my career, it basically let me know that the work I put in on my craft, and the way I play the game, how I was taught to play the game when I picked up a basketball when I was eight years old, it's okay to play that way and be able to win.  No matter how many people tell you, you should maybe shoot more, you should maybe do this more, you should maybe be like him more, it let me know that the way I play basketball and the way I was taught to play basketball is the right way to play it, because you do see results. And then it just continues to boost your confidence.  Not saying that AD doesn't already have confidence, but it takes it to another level."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,"You talk about how you can't focus on other teams and their bubble experience, but for you outside looking in, it seemed like you were locked in from the beginning of the entire journey to now. I imagine you had your days off the court when it comes to the personal sacrifice, when it comes to keeping this group together.  Is that the case?  Were there ups and downs?  How different is just is this championship feeling? Le","To answer your first question, absolutely.  I think you wouldn't be human if you didn't have ups and downs in the bubble.  At times I was questioning myself, should I be here?  Is this worth sacrificing my family?  So many things.  I've never been without my family this long.  Missing the days of my daughter being in kindergarten, even though it's through Zoom.  Missing my son's 16th birthday, which we all know is a big birthday if you have kids. Seeing my middle child continue to grow and be who he is.  First of all, big-time shoutout to the late great Steve Jobs, because without him, without his vision, those FaceTime calls wouldn't be possible. Absolutely, I've had ups and downs throughout this journey.  For some odd reason, I was able to keep the main thing the main thing.  When I talked about all the stuff that I missed, they understood that, too, and that made it a lot easier for me. To answer your second question, it doesn't matter where it is if you win a championship.  A bubble, Miami, Golden State -- it doesn't matter.  When you get to this point, it's one of the greatest feelings in the world for a basketball player to be able to win at the highest level."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,Does any one of your championships stand out in terms of the difficulty? Le,"Well, I can't sit here and say one is more challenging than the other or one is more difficult than the other.  I can just say that I've never won with this atmosphere.  None of us have.  We've never been a part of this.  If you've been here throughout the start -- I mean, we got here July 9th.  Our ballclub got here July 9th.  It's October what -- I don't even , October 11th now. So this was very challenging and difficult.  It played with your mind.  It played with your body.  You're away from some of the things that you're so accustomed to to make you be the professional that you are.  So this is right up there. I heard some rumblings from people that are not in the bubble, oh, you don't have to travel, whatever. People just doubting what goes on in here.  This is right up there with one of the greatest accomplishments I've had."
2020-10-11,41:13,28.0,0.65,14.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1,"When you signed with the Lakers, over the course of the first year, Magic stepping down and everything that went into your start here, was there ever a moment where your mind wandered or you thought maybe the hill would be too high or hard to climb to get back to this point in L.A., or if not, how did you know or what gave you faith that you guys would get here? Le","What gave me faith is that Rob Pelinka told me he would do whatever it takes to make sure that we would become a winning franchise once again.  Obviously, championships are not promised, and I don't expect that.  But he said he would do whatever it takes to make this franchise, whatever personnel changes he needs to make, any part of our organization, he would do it, because he wanted to win just as much. And for me, being able to get Jeanie back to this point, that's something that fueled me as well.  This is a historic franchise and to be a part of this is something that I'll be able to talk about and my grandkids and kids will be able to talk about; their pawpaw played for the Los Angeles Lakers.  It's like playing for the Yankees and winning or playing for the Cowboys and winning a Super Bowl, or the Patriots.  It's like playing for the Red Sox. So to be able to win with a historical franchise is something that, no matter if your mind wavers away, you can always remember what you're doing it for."

Le,"I don't want to lie to you.  I did, but if Jeanie at some point would ever want to reveal what I said to her, that's up to her.  It was just a special moment and I know how special it was for her.  So it was just in the words of, ""I'm proud to be a Laker."" FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

What did you think of the mental resolve to withstand a 14-0 run in this building late and close those guys out with poise? Le","I mean, that's been us since we made acquisitions with our new guys.  We've been able to be very resilient in games.  Like I said, we've been playing lot of basketball for about two and a half months now, just trying to punch our clock and to be able to play right now in the post-season. We've been very resilient.  Tonight versus a team like Golden State, defending champions, we know how great they are on their home floor over the years.  To withstand that, it's another good step for our ballclub."

I think even though late they made a run, throughout the second half only giving up 48 points, that's really good.  But we had a couple lulls when they allowed those guys, Steph, Klay and Jordan, to get some looks, they were really tuned in.  They're going to get their looks anyways, so we can't have our own personal problems.  We got to be better.  We got to be better. We love the game plan, but we got to be better as the guys on the floor."

What kind of advice have you had for coach?  What do you think about how he's grown this rookie season for him? Le","For us, we've been a part of this franchise the longest that's on this franchise right now.  We've had our battles together. For us to be able to have that relationship with the coaching staff, have that relationship with Coach Ham, him to be able to trust us on the floor that we can be a extension of his, relay his commands, his messages, it just makes it a lot calming for him that he knows he has guys on the floor that has been in a fight, has been in a foxhole and has experience in tough games. Every game and every day is another learning experience for our coaching staff and for us.  We just try to make it as seamless as possible when we step on the floor with the game plan they're giving us."

When you were not able to score and they did catch you, was that a lack of execution on your part or did you simply miss some shots? Le","No, never a lack of execution with us.  At the end of the day we only had eight turnovers, so that let us know we was not sloppy with the ball.  We were executing at a high level. Just missed some shots.  I can think about four or five shots.  A.R. had a shot from the left wing, missed it.  I had a fade-away jumper in the paint and missed it.  I was able to hit A.D. on a cut.  One of his patent jump hooks, he missed it, got the offensive rebound, missed it again.  They lost it around their sideline, gave us another extra possession.  A.D. had a wide-open three opposite of their bench. Sometimes it's a make-or-miss league.  We executed to perfection, we just didn't make it."

He joins Shaq, Elgin, Kareem and Wilt, franchise players who have done that.  How does that encapsulate him joining a list like that, what he's doing for your team right now? Le","I mean, the Lakers franchise over the years, over the course of their existence, has always had dominant big men, dominant guys that have been a force at the rim.  That's why their jerseys are in the rafters.  A.D. will be up there when he's done playing.  The No. 3 will be up in the rafters. He continues to show why he's one of the best players that we have in this league.  For us, it's a treat for us to be able to have such a dynamic player that cannot only go out and get you 30 and 20, but also command the paint defensively, can switch out the guards, also get you five assists, as well. It's a treat for us, a treat for the Laker franchise to have another one that wears the purple and gold that's in the present right now."

How do you feel winning your first Playoff game in the new Chase Center as a Laker? Le","It's always great to win in the post-season, no matter where you are, no matter who you're playing.  It's very difficult to win in the post-season. Like you said, I got a lot of history in Oracle, a lot of battles in that arena over the years.  It's definitely a different feeling walking here into a post-season game, being in the Chase Arena now, like you said. That Warriors and the GS, those colors hasn't changed.  So my focus and my respect for them hasn't changed, as well.  It's just an honor to be able to play this game at a high level, play with other great players, then also look on the other side and see other great players, being a part of that's historic, something that lasts a lot longer than we are today.  That's pretty cool.  Thank you. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

We got to obviously see the adjustments they made, we got to make our adjustments coming into Game 3."

Le","You got to keep scoring, get to the free-throw line as well, or just get points in the paint.  They're going to go on runs.  That's what they do.  But you got to keep scoring, try to hold the fort down. You give credit where credit is due.  They played exceptionally well tonight and we didn't.  The series is tied 1-1.  That's where we're at."

Warriors are pretty unique the way they play compared to the rest of the league.  What do you think it will take to make your defense shine as much as it has? Le,"We still are.  That doesn't change.  We're still the best defensive team in the league, if not one of them.  So that doesn't change.  That's what we hang our hats on. But like I said, you give credit where credit is due.  Klay was spectacular tonight.  Draymond was great in the pocket pass with the rolls, things of that nature.  JaMychal gave them big-time.  Those 12 minutes felt like 24 minutes, 30 minutes.  He was big-time for their team in the starting role tonight, too. You give credit, like I said where credit is due.  We move on to the next game.  But our defense, that's where we hang our hat.

2023-05-10,39:10,25.0,0.529,9.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"How much a part of that do you figure now as you get back for Game 6, a situation you've been in before, maybe a little bit of uncertainty about AD, but how do you approach this as a leader going back on the plane?","That we have another opportunity.  Obviously they played exceptionally well here tonight, and we had some good moments, but not as close to 48 minutes as we needed to be, but we've got another opportunity on Friday, and we look forward to the matchup again."
2023-05-10,39:10,25.0,0.529,9.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"It was a tie game with about four minutes to go in the second quarter and then we know this is a team that can go on runs, but when you think back to the late second quarter, early third that you felt like on your team's end that contributed to that run?","I mean, we kind of made a run, we had an opportunity to -- I missed an easy jump hook in the lane to cut the lead to three.  AD, right after I missed the jump hook, he had an opportunity to have a tip dunk, missed it.  We blew a coverage, Klay hit a three on that right wing, put them up eight, and then we came back down, missed again, and then Steph hit the big one at the end of the quarter. We know they're a team of runs, and you've got to be able to match that, and they just kept it going in the third, obviously."

Do you feel like that affected anything in terms of the way the game was dealt with tonight on the court?","I just know that our coaching staff and us players, we don't work on flopping.  That's not even a part of our game.  Our game is to attack, attack the paint.  We don't mind physical contact.  We actually like the contact.  We don't shy away from it. We're just not a team that goes out there looking for flopping opportunities.  That's just not us.  It's actually never been any team that I've played on in my 20 years where we've been a flopping team.  It is what it is.  They have their right to say what they want to say, but the game is always won between the four lines, and we've got to be better on Friday for sure."
2023-05-10,39:10,25.0,0.529,9.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"Earlier today you were named to the all-NBA third team.  I think this is 19 straight years for you.  Knowing what you've done and dealt with physically and stuff like that, how does this one hit differently in year 20?","I guess I don't take those moments for granted.  When you get an opportunity to be recognized as one of the best players still in the league and have one of the best seasons and make all-NBA team, I don't take anything that I've been able to accomplish for granted and I'm always appreciative for the -- to be a part of any selection in this league.  There's so many great players, so many great teams, and a lot of guys this year had some really good seasons, great seasons.  To be a part of that class of 15 guys, when I seen the list, is still pretty cool, even at my age and where I'm at right now, year 20.  Just don't take it for granted. Obviously I've got bigger fish to fry, but those small moments, those small wins right there is all part of the journey, all part of the legacy as far as what I do on the floor in this league, so that's pretty cool."
2023-05-10,39:10,25.0,0.529,9.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,"In your career, you've played in plenty of Game 6s where you have a chance to clinch.  You also just had that last series.  Is there something you think this team this year needs to focus on Friday in comparison to the past?","I mean, every moment is its own challenge and is its own game and is its own opportunity to see what you're made of, and we can't base last series on to this series.  This series is different.  The opponent is different.  The challenges is different. Friday is another opportunity for us to see where we are, to see what we're made of, and to go out there with I guess the grit and the fight that we've had since we came together after the All-Star break, very resilient team, and we respond well to adversity, and we look forward to that, to getting an opportunity to play again on Friday."

I wanted to know if you have any message for the Laker fans planning to come to the game on Friday?","Well, we didn't handle our business tonight, so I look forward to seeing our fans for another game in the second round.  You know, those six games are out the window.  It's over and done with.  Our job is to try to be 1-0 on Friday.  I look forward to that opportunity."

I assume the same approach going into this one?","Yeah, it's the same.  It's the same. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
2023-05-16,39:52,26.0,0.563,12.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,What did you notice about the way Denver hit first? Was the key on the glass with Jokic and how did you adjust over the course of the game? Le,"Yeah, it took us a half to get into the game and that was pretty much the ballgame right there.  We have to understand that we have to start from the tip-off, and they punched us in the mouth to start.  I think they had more offensive rebounds than we had total rebounds in the first half, and you know, that led to them getting second-chance points. They also got them on fast break and killed us in the fast break in the first half and was 10-for-10 from the free throw line.  I know the game is won in 48 minutes, but they set the tone in 24 minutes and we were playing catch-up for the next 24."
2023-05-16,39:52,26.0,0.563,12.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,You've been through so many of these before.  How can the team be affected by cutting the margin down to three like you did tonight and going into the next game versus it staying out of reach? Le,"In postseason it doesn't matter if you cut it to one or you're down 20, if you lose, you lose.  They are 1-0 and we have to come back with desperation going into Game 2.  We have to play better, we have to rebound better.  I thought we did a good job of not turning the ball over.  That's one thing we've been very conscious about in the postseason, but we've been better in transition and tonight we weren’t that great in the first half but we cleaned it up in the second half.  So, we need to be better in all facets of the game."
2023-05-16,39:52,26.0,0.563,12.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,What was the key to that fourth quarter stretch where you hit Austin a couple times? Le,"Just kind of reading the game.  It's always a game between the game and just reading the game and making the proper reads. You know, they started to go to a 3-4-5, switching pick-and-rolls but any time I was involved with AD they started to switch Jokic onto me and try to keep it body on body, because AD was doing a great job of getting to that pocket and doing what he does best with his floaters and things of that nature. We know we have opportunities and we can go to other things that also can work for us with myself handling the ball, try to get in pick-and-roll, try to get the good matchup, seeing how they are going to play, if they are going to switch or hard show or whatever the case may be and we just try to exploit that and allow AR [Austin Reaves] to get going in the fourth."
2023-05-16,39:52,26.0,0.563,12.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,You guys found stuff after the first half but how much of it do you think was the size on the court to start the game?  You guys didn't go small and they are a pretty big team and I think at one point they had nine offensive rebounds on the first 11 misses in the game.  How much of a factor do you think that was? Le,"Some of them was effort plays.  Some of them was just out of reach.  You know, we had a couple opportunities to get early defensive rebounds; we wasn't able to do that.  One of them was a block-out by me and Jokic coming down the middle was one of his offensive rebounds. I think some of them was effort and some of them is about size but for the majority, some of them in the first half, we wasn't just locked in.  We wasn't in tune.  He had six offensive rebounds in the first quarter; he had six offensive rebounds for the game.  So that just lets you know we started to get more in tune with what we need to do and how we need to block out and how we need to hit bodies and things of that nature, and I think we got better as the game went on."
2023-05-16,39:52,26.0,0.563,12.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,Austin and Rui said they felt there was a lack of energy and effort in the first half.  Do you agree with that and how do you explain lack of effort in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals? Le,"We'll be better.  We'll be better.  We know we didn't play up to our capabilities in the first half.  I even thought in the third quarter when we were going back and forth making shots, I thought we were still in tune with it.  They were just making some, you know, shots with hands in their faces, bodies on bodies. But you know we'll be better in Game 2, that's for sure."
2023-05-16,39:52,26.0,0.563,12.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,A lot to be made about Jokic tonight and his performance but what about AD's game? Le,"AD was phenomenal, 40 and 10, changed shots at the rim.  But he's been -- AD has been great all postseason, so we are not worried about that.  You know, so we just have to do our job, as well, myself, chipping in, everybody down the ladder from there.  It's nothing that surprised us about AD's performance. We have to do a great job of just backing him up, not only on the offensive end to relieve pressure off of him but also on the defensive end, as well.  When he's changing shots, we have to clean glass, we have to help, we have to make our rotations clean.  That allows us to do what we need to do offensively. Appreciate it.

2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,What did you feel like when Denver was hitting those five straight threes?  What's the differences in your coverages and what you're trying to do battling Jokic versus what you're giving up on the outside? Le,"Only one of them was uncontested.  All of them was great contests.  Two of Jamal's threes was right in the face of me and AD.  The Michael Porter Jr one by our bench was right in the face of AR after a transition, they were in transition.  Bruce Brown had one as well with a contest. They made -- that was it, the three-point line is what killed us in the fourth, but I didn't see many breakdowns though."
2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,"Obviously two teams playing here, you're playing the No. 1 team in the West, and Jamal had a remarkable performance particularly in the fourth quarter.  What did you see out him and what type of rhythm was he able to find against you guys' defense? Le","He made shots.  He made shots at the end of the clock when we guarded for 24 seconds, and he made two big-time shots, one over AD and one over myself.  Had his mid-range game going.  But he had his three-point shot going in the fourth.  It's no surprise to anybody, he's done it before.  Hate to be on the other side of it but I don't feel like we had many breakdowns when he was doing what he was doing.  He made shots and sometimes it's a make-or-miss league. I feel like defensively we were really good.  They shot 43 percent for the No. 1 offense in the league.  And so it just sucks that those five threes in the fourth definitely killed us."
2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,What did you guys make of the starting lineup adjustment going back to the starting lineup you guys have been using for most of the second half of the season and just kind of playing bigger lineups in general tonight? Le,"It doesn't matter at this point who starts, who comes off the bench, it's just about how we can get it done and win a game.  That's all that matters."
2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,"They haven't lost a game at home in the postseason, neither have you guys.  If you include the Play-In I think you won the last seven.  Does that give you guys any more -- is that a benefit for you guys going home knowing you haven't lost a game? Le","We still got to play with the same desperation as we did tonight.  We came out with an L but doesn't give us any more comfort.  We can't go into any postseason game with comfort, just because you either haven't lost at home or you're going back home.  I think it's even more you got to be on edge, because when you go home you get in your own bed, get around your family, everybody's being cool and jolly and everything.  Nah, you got to be even more on edge when you go home.  So, we got to understand that going back and being down 0-2.  There's no reason for us to get comfortable."
2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,After these two games what do you think you need to improve and keep doing now that you are going home? Le,"I think we improved from Game 1 to Game 2.  And if we can do the same thing from Game 2 to Game 3, we put ourselves in a position to win."
2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,"You've been in this position before, every time you've won.  From a mental and emotional standpoint what do you take out of that that can be applied, if anything? Le","What you take out of it is the fact that this is not the NCAA tournament, it's the first team to four wins.  We have an opportunity to go home and play great basketball and hold serve.  So until a team beats you four times then you always have an opportunity to come out of it.  So that's the confidence that we should have.  I know it's going to be a tough hill to climb up, but we still have an opportunity to play good basketball and play the best basketball of the series in Game 3. Like I said, if we can get better from Game 2 like we did tonight to Game 3, then we put ourselves in a position to do that."
2023-05-18,40:08,22.0,0.474,9.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,"The dunk in the first half is not a play we often see.  The ball squirts out like that.  There was another play I think in the third where you guys got an offensive rebound and Dennis could have held for one, he shoots.  When the margins are so slim are those the plays that kind of eat at you between now and Game 3? Le","No, I mean those are -- obviously you have an opportunity, I mean, my opportunity puts us up 10 and instead it was an eight-point deficit in the game for us.  Obviously, that's sucks that that ball squirted out of my hand like that, whatever the case may be, maybe hit my knee or whatever, but unforced turnover by myself.  Horrible.  Especially on the road.  The same thing at the end of the third.  I missed a three -- I believe we were up five -- I miss a three.  Jamal Murray tried to save it, saves it right to AD and we swing it to AR.  And Dennis had a pretty good look, but we had an opportunity to hold and not take the shot with a five-point lead.  And instead they get the block, Bruce Brown gets the block, Joker pushes it, throws it to the right corner away from our bench.  KCP, we get a great contest on KCP from AR.  And I thought it was a great block by AD, to be completely honest, but they called goaltending, instead of being up five we're up three.  So those are momentum plays, for sure, both of them.

Just one at a time.  Just focus on Game 4, and you know, that's all you can really think about.  I mean, obviously this game is over and done with.  We had some opportunities but we didn't come through. So just get ready for Monday and just got to get one.  It's a one-game series for us.  Every game counts, obviously."

2023-05-20,42:57,23.0,0.421,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0,What did you see? Le,"That was the game.  We had back-to-back turnovers.  After Rui made two free throws, we went up one and had back-to-back turnovers and they hit back-to-back threes, and made us take a time-out and we never got back in rhythm."
2023-05-20,42:57,23.0,0.421,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0,This team has been in a fight-for-survival mode for months. Le,For sure.
2023-05-20,42:57,23.0,0.421,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0,"Has there been any buildup from that, in terms of like you guys having to be so locked in for, what, 40, 50 games? Le","Yeah, we still are.  We still are.  We have to come in obviously tomorrow and watch film and be disappointed and upset and whatever the case may be. And use that and use some of the miscues or whatever the case may be, and also some of the things that we did well to apply to Game 4.  You know, that's all you can worry about."
2023-05-20,42:57,23.0,0.421,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0,What is Denver doing in the series so far that's allowed them to be successful?  You guys faced them in the Conference Finals a couple years ago; they have All-Stars; they have accomplished with their team.  But where do you think the edge has been for them? Le,"I mean, obviously Jamal was fantastic in the first half today.  He got them off to a great start, and even with that, we were only down three at the half. I think it's been the timely shots by their role players.  Obviously I think the KCPs and Michael Porter Jrs. and Bruce Browns, even Jeff hit a big-time timely shot today when we were kind of going on a run.  I think it's been the supporting cast that have kind of made those timely shots that's allowed them to kind of have the edge."
2023-05-20,42:57,23.0,0.421,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0,"You guys had ""0.3 percent"" written on the whiteboard very recently signifying your chances of making the playoffs; you did any ways.  Obviously the odds of coming back from a 3-0 deficit are every tougher but is that belief still there? Le","I mean, it should be.  I hope so.  I can't speak for the guys right now because I don't know what's going on through all their minds right now.  But I still do. So you know, it's time to go right back home and start to refuel and start the treatment process and recovery process and get ready for Monday.  My mindset is always locked in as if it's Game 1."

Does that thought even cross your mind that that's the only way you can do it and you would like to make history again, obviously? Le",Of course.  That's the only mindset for me for sure.
2023-05-20,42:57,23.0,0.421,7.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0,"What's the biggest challenge trying to defend Jamal Murray, with him in particular? Le","I mean, once he gets going, it's kind of hard to turn him off.  I mean, obviously you know, he got going from the very beginning. We watched one clip at halftime where we allowed him to see the ball go in because we didn't match up in transition. And early in the first quarter, and he had one from their left wing by their bench, wide open shot.  And a guy that has that type of rhythm, and we all know, I mean, Jamal is one of those guys in our league that if you -- he'll run off 20 in a quarter or 30 in a half, and that's what he did tonight. So everyone in our league knows that, especially when he gets going and he gets to bouncing and shooting the three-ball, shooting the mid-range, posting up smaller guards. He can score at all three levels of the game - from the paint, from the free throw line and also from the three-point line.  You tip your hat.  He's a hell of a player. Appreciate it.

Is that something you decided before the game and being on the court that much, trying to find your legs that much, did that symbolize anything about what this run has been like for you? Le","For me it's just a mindset.  Training the mind, you train the mind, the body will fall where it may and take care of the rest.  Knowing, coming into a game where I may have to play a full game, that's just my mindset, and wasn't able to come through, and wasn't able to get the win.  That was just my mindset going into tonight."

I think I've seen you yawn more than I've seen anybody yawn through the course of a season.  But how did this group energize you as it got into the postseason and as you got a chance to get one level away from the Finals? Le","I think it energized me from the moment I was out for those four weeks and just seeing the type of team that we had, the type of energy that we brought into the locker room, the type of energy we brought onto the floor.  You know, I just couldn't wait to join these guys with action and get on the floor and I knew how much I could make an impact with the group of guys. But it was always -- it was an exciting moment when we were able just to bring those guys into the locker room.  You know, we were just a better team right away, and it results in getting to the Western Conference Finals."

When you reflect on it, what were the margins, the edges that Denver ultimately was successful with? Le","Me and AD were just talking in the locker room for a little bit.  I think we came to the consensus, this is if not, one of the best teams, if not the best team, we've played together for all four years.  Just well orchestrated, well put together.  They have scoring.  They have shooting.  They have play-making.  They have smarts.  They have length.  They have depth.  And one thing about their team, when you have a guy like Jokic, who as big as he is but also as cerebral as he is, you can't really make many mistakes versus a guy like that. And even when you guard him for one of the best possessions that you think you can guard him, he puts the ball behind his head Larry Bird style and shoots it 50 feet in the air and it goes in, like he did four or five times this series [laughter].  So you do like this to him [tipping cap]."

I guess I'll reflect on my career when I'm done.  But I don't know.  I'll let you guys talk about it. The only thing I concern myself with is being available to my teammates, and I don't like the fact that I didn't play as many games as I would've liked because of injury.  That's the only thing I care about is being available to my teammates."

Le,"I mean, of course, that's human nature when you're a competitor.  Obviously frustrated.  Not being able to close out one of these games where you were in every game.  You know, two games in Denver, two games here, were winning [in] every game.  We were up 15 at the half.  They hit us with a 36-point quarter, took momentum of the game.  We still and had an opportunity but just couldn't make plays down the stretch. That's the frustrating part.  You tip your hat to them.  Like I said, it's a great team."
2023-05-22,47:56,40.0,0.6,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,"How do you balance the disappointment of a missed opportunity but also look at this roster that's kind of reloaded and has potential for even greater things next year, potentially a championship roster, how do you balance the disappointment but also the hope for next year? Le","I mean, I don't know.  Like I said, I haven't began to even think about next year.  We had a great run but we fell short of our goal.  Our goal is to win championships.  That's what this franchise is about and we fell short of that.  That's disappointing."
2023-05-22,47:56,40.0,0.6,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,"I'm curious if you would walk us through, the day starts with Carmelo Anthony, someone who you were, are, very close with, and your contemporary announcing his retirement and you getting ready to play in a Western Conference Finals game as the last man standing, if you will, from that class.  What was that like for you? Le","Well, I kind of knew the announcement was going to happen because I shot the video a week ago [laughter] that you guys seen today.  So, people probably think I'm lying about that, too, huh?  I shot that video like a week ago, so I already knew the announcement was coming, just didn't know which day, but it happened today. Still bittersweet, honestly.  That's one of my best friends when I got into this league, even before I got into this league.  We had so many moments when we were in high school from competing against each other to sitting outside of a hotel room at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning on the steps of a hotel and just talking about our journey up until where we were 17, I was 16, he was 17, and what we could possibly do going forward, what we could possibly do for our mothers, what we could possibly do for our families if we just continued to stay focused.  I believe we was a driving force for one another.  We were locked at the hip since high school. And then you guys saw once we got into the NBA, he was always a motivating factor for me, being in the Western Conference, I was in the East.  So, I would play our games and then rush home downtown Cleveland where I had an apartment my first two years in the league, and rushed and turned the Nuggets games on and watched Melo play.  All the way to the point where we didn't make the playoffs my first year, I was in Denver for his first playoff game.  You could look that up, too, just in case you think I'm lying about that, too. So definitely just a bittersweet moment today to see one of my great friends, I never say call it quits, just to say that, you know, it's an amazing run.  An amazing accomplishment.  An amazing career.  And you know we just we'll always be joined at the hip no matter what."
2023-05-22,47:56,40.0,0.6,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,"What, if anything, did Jokic prove to you during this series? Le","Nothing.  I know how great he is.  I know how great Jokic is.  There are certain guys in this league that play the game a certain way, a certain way that I like to play the game as well, and he's one of them where you are always off balance when you are guarding a player like that because of his ability to score, rebound, shoot.  He sees plays before they happen.  There's not many guys in our league like that. So you already knew you was going against a beast once the series started, and not only just about his game.  Everybody gets cracked up into his stats but I don't think a lot of people talk about, like, this part of his game [indicating cerebral].  Maybe it's not talked about it, because a lot of people don't understand it, but I do.  He's special."
2023-05-22,47:56,40.0,0.6,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,"How confident are you with this roster to go into next year to say that you'll be back and not just be back, but go further? Le","To be honest, I'm not quite sure what the roster will look like next year.  I think myself, AD, Max Christie, I think Vando has a team option, player option, something like that, I don't know who else -- I mean, the roster is not set.  Obviously that's Rob and the front office, they are going to figure out the best way to put this team together to go forward in the fall.  But it's not like we have a team full of multi-year guys that's stuck in a contract right now.  So, I don't know, we'll see."
2023-05-22,47:56,40.0,0.6,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,"There was a video making the rounds of you shooting before the game, and they were doing a rehearsal for the trophy presentation on the court.  Did that motivate you or annoy you? Le",It was a little motivating factor for me tonight.
2023-05-22,47:56,40.0,0.6,10.0,9.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,"Obviously all-time scoring record, another season where you essentially defeat Father Time again.  On a personal level, how would you evaluate the season that you had? Le","I don't know.  I love to play the game.  I love to compete.  I love to be out there for my guys, my teammates, whoever I have that particular year.  I think it was special in the fact that having a first-year coach, first-year coaching staff, to be able to take them to the Western Conference Finals, I think that's dope for Coach Ham and his coaching staff going forward.  That's pretty amazing. For me, it's all about availability for me and keeping my mind sharp and things of that nature, being present on the floor, being present in the locker room and bus rides and plane rides, things of that nature.  It's challenging.  It's challenging for sure.  It was a very challenging season for me, for our ballclub, and obviously we know whatever went on early on or whatever the case may be.  It was cool, a pretty cool ride. But I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it was okay.  I don't like to say it's a successful year because I don't play for anything besides winning championships at this point in my career.  You know, I don't get a kick out of making a Conference [Finals] appearance.  I've done it, a lot.  And it's not fun to me to not be able to be a part of getting to the Finals. But we'll see.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens going forward.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've got a lot to think about to be honest.  I've got a lot to think about to be honest.  Just for me personally going forward with the game of basketball, I've got a lot to think about. Appreciate it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"
