      "questions": {
        "0": "Last night after the Dunk Contest, Ja said he might be willing to give it a shot.  Giannis chimed in.  Zach LaVine also mentioned it.  Is there any part of you that regrets never doing it?  And with a procession of people maybe saying they might do it, would it propel you to give it a chance at next year's All-Star Game?",
        "1": "Obviously your team, the Lakers, made a huge deal a couple weeks ago to trade for Luka Doncic.  I'm wondering if in any way having a 25-year-old talent like that makes you think about the end of your career and if it could be extended further than year 23, et cetera?",
        "2": "Curious your thoughts of the overall state of the league.  You've been through a lot of stuff in your two decades.  Where do you find the game to be right now?  What ways could it be better?  What ways maybe is it better now than it was when you started?",
        "3": "You had said a couple months ago that you had thoughts about where the game was going and you talked about threes and things like that and you said this wasn't the proper forum to discuss it.  I wonder if today is a more proper forum to discuss it.  Ideally if you could have the game look the way you think is the best way to play basketball, would it look like it's played now, or would there be differences?",
        "4": "This is not the how-many-years-left question, but now that you're 40, year 22, all these accolades, obviously, how do you balance still being in the moment and trying to win championships and doing all the things that you're wired to do versus knowing that the finish line is obviously closer and appreciating what you've done and where you are?",
        "5": "You have a huge fan base in China; do you have any plans to visit China?  What's your message to show the fans there who adore you?",
        "6": "Wemby said that he had a list of questions that he wanted to ask you.  What advice would you give him and the other young guys who are hoping to have a career that resembles yours?",
        "7": "I just wanted to follow up on tonight's game.  You've got Stephon Castle and the Rising Stars team going against the OGs, you, KD, Steph.  What's your approach to that new format, and what will we see from you tonight?",
        "8": "Back in 2007, you hosted Saturday Night Live.  You were the last active NBA player to host that show.  We've got All-Star, but they're also celebrating their 50th anniversary this season.  What's it like to be a part of that show's legacy, and what NBA players should host that show next?",
        "9": "Can you talk about the state of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry and rivalries in the NBA more broadly?",
        "10": "You're not playing tonight; that's going to be a record that ends that'll probably never come down, consecutive All-Star starts at 20.  My question was when you were 30 and we were talking about who is coming behind you, that discussion may have been a little premature.  But now that you're 40 and you're talking about the end at some point, do you have a player in mind who will be the best player in the league in five years?",
        "11": "We go around the world reviewing different basketball courts and we started in the UK and we went to the I Promise School, traveled all the way there, reviewed that.  I want to know from you, one basketball court that means the most to you or you played on growing up that we need to check out and review.",
        "12": "To follow up on the foot and the ankle, you played on Wednesday in Utah.  There's a game scheduled this Wednesday.  Because of the fires and rescheduling.  Do you anticipate being available at the start of this week?  Or was this more kind of a maintenance type of wear-and-tear situation?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, there's no part of me that has regrets about not doing it.  Obviously, I had a couple moments where I wanted to do it, and it just never worked out that way going into the following season, either, because of injuries or I just wasn't up for it. But I don't know.  If those guys do do it, those are superstars in our league, and obviously we know the athleticism of the guys that you just named.  It would be pretty cool.  We'll see.",
        "1": "No, I have not given it that type of thought.  Just the excitement of being able to add a caliber player like that, a generational talent like that to our franchise, it's something that's given me energy. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can do.  We only had two games so far, and I believe he's been on a minutes restriction since he came back from the calf.  He hasn't played since Christmas, I believe.  As he continues to get in form, I think we could be really good going down the stretch.  But we'll see what happens.",
        "2": "Well, the fact of how many international channels and places and players that come into our league and viewers we have all over the world, the game continues to expand, and that's a great thing for our game. We love our game.  The game of basketball is beautiful.  It's done so many things for us players and everybody in this room, as well, to be able to cover it.  We're always just trying to figure out ways how we can continue to build the game, how we can continue to make it better and better.  It's better from when I entered the league in 2003, and hopefully it continues to be even better when I'm done playing, as well.",
        "3": "I mean, the game can always continue to get better and better.  But that's just for all of us to try to figure out what's best for our sport.  We want to continue to engage in our viewership, continue to engage in our consumer that loves our sport and continue to understand that the guys that play the game and have their minds on how we can continue to improve the game. To answer your question, no, this is definitely not the room.  There's too many faces I have no idea who it is in here.  I would not open up to this room about that. But I'm definitely always trying to have thoughts and questions and hopefully solutions.  That's the most important, of how we can continue to build our game.  That's what's most important.",
        "4": "I think they merge right into one another.  I think I have a great appreciation for the moment because I understand that it's not going to be a lot of moments going into the future, whenever that time comes. You have an opportunity to really, really truly appreciate every single moment and take it all in, no matter the good, the bad, the adversity, whatever comes with the day-to-day process of being a professional and still trying to play for championships, but more importantly just engaging in every single day and every single moment of being able to do what I love to do, and I've been doing it for such a long time, been a professional for 22 years.  I've been playing the game at a level where coaches and referees was involved since I was eight.  So, this is something I've always dived into and always loved the process. I think they just intertwine together.",
        "5": "Yeah, I've been to China a lot, and I've always had a great deal of respect for the culture, for the way they love the game of basketball, and every time I've went and left, they've always welcomed me with open arms to come back.  That's always been a fun trip for me.  My message to them, like it's always been, if you love the game, play it as much as you can, enjoy it, play free, and be around the great people that love the game, as well.  It makes the game that much more fun. It's always been a treat, either if I was going there for Nike or the NBA or for the Olympics.  I've always had a good time.",
        "6": "Well, obviously it always dictates on what the questions that he wants to ask me.  But as far as Wemby, I mean, it seems like from the outside looking in that he has a great head on his shoulders.  He seems like he loves the game, that he takes care of his body, the process and everything. You're going to get out of the game what you put into it.  Iâ€™ve seen one quote that he says that nobody better call him past 9:00 at night because he's either reading or he's asleep.  I think that's super cool.  I think that's super dope.  That lets you know where his mind frame is at, where he is at intellectually, and I think he's been great, obviously, for the franchise with the Spurs, but he's going to be great for our league for so many years to come.",
        "7": "You won't see anything from me tonight, unfortunately.  I will not be in uniform tonight.  Still dealing with ankle and foot discomfort, so I will not be playing tonight, unfortunately.  I hate that, but I'm looking forward to seeing the format. This is the first year for it.  I know we've got a lot of great -- calling us the OGs, that's hilarious.  We do got a few guys with gray hair, so that makes sense.  So that should be fun. I saw the quote the other day with DK [Dalton Knecht] say he was going to play against me.  So I guess I'll see him in practice and we can go at it then.",
        "8": "To be a part of the Saturday Night Live legacy is something that -- a dream come true.  It's been on, obviously, my entire life, and seeing so many great actors grace those skits every single Saturday and so many entertainers that come there and do their bits, as well, it was fun. It was super fun, and hopefully I get the opportunity to do it again.  I would love to do it again.  I was so young.  You said 2006? 2007? I was 21, 22 maybe.  It was super fun. I don't know.  I don't know.  Kevin Love is hilarious, by the way, and he's a great friend of mine, and I could definitely see him doing Saturday Night Live for sure.  He's one of my great friends and he's hilarious.  But it was definitely a treat and something that I can always look back and say I was on a show that Will Ferrell has been on and so many great guys.  Bill Hader is a good friend of mine.  It was pretty cool.",
        "9": "When it comes to rivalries, if it's that deep rooted, then it will always live on.  The Celtics and Lakers, you look at Ohio State-Michigan, you look at Yankees-Red Sox.  There's just certain matchups that no matter who's out on the floor or who's on the gridiron or -- it is what it is because of the tenure and the legacy of it.  That's what stands with the Lakers and the Celtics, for how many years we've been competing against that franchise and whatever, and both have had so much success.  It will always stand the test of time forever.",
        "10": "I don't, to answer that question.  I do not.  There are too many great young players right now to just say, well, this one guy will be the best player in the league.  Our league is filled with so many talented players, so many guys that can transcend the game on the floor and off the floor, and I think it's in a really good place. It was definitely premature at 30 to ask me that question, but our game is in a really good place.",
        "11": "Wow.  That's a great question.  I've played on so many indoor and outdoor courts growing up in Akron, Ohio, that they all have a special meaning to me.  I played at Elizabeth Park projects when I was growing up.  I played Summer Lake Recreation Center.  I played at the YMCA downtown.  I played at the Urban League.  I played at outdoor courts like Perkins Pool, Hawkins Court, Ed Davis, as well, in my hometown. Me and my best friends, who we're still best friends today, we went all over the city either on our bikes or we walked around and we would go look for a game and see if guys were playing ball either indoor or outdoor, and we wanted to get a run in no matter what. It's a lot of courts in our city that I don't know if they're still, like, actively playing ball.  I know a lot of kids don't really be outside as much as we did when we were younger, but there's a lot of courts that hold a lot of meaning to me because it started the whole love of the game for me, just being able to go out and play just for the love of the game and the freedom that we had.",
        "12": "I mean, it's a little bit of both.  I was hoping that it would feel a lot better this morning, but it's not where I want it to be.  With 30 games left and us trying to make a playoff push in the wild, wild west, I feel like it's important for me to take care of myself and understand what's coming on. I don't want to say it's maintenance -- well, it is maintenance, but at the same time, it's like, I have to look out for myself when it comes to this injury that I've been dealing with for years. I hope to be available on Wednesday.  We have to have a makeup game.  So, I am headed back to LA tonight.  There will be no vacation for me, so I head back to LA tonight and back to rehab tomorrow and getting ready for practice on Tuesday, and hopefully I can play against Charlotte on Wednesday and hopefully play against Portland on Thursday.  It's a big stretch for us. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, for you, an NBA-record 20th All-Star selection.  What has the All-Star Game meant to you in your career and how it has evolved, if it has evolved, from your early stages to now?",
        "1": "LeBron, you missed the last game prior to the break in Salt Lake City because of the left ankle.  Did you seek any treatment on it in the days leading up to the All-Star Game?  What's your plan in terms of minutes tonight?  And how can you manage that and just your health in general to try to get this team as far as they can go the remainder of the season?",
        "2": "LeBron, in year 21, how are the ways that you affect the game?  How has that changed, in terms of both methods and frequency?  And how has that affected the players around you, and has it given guys opportunities to maybe take on more roles, bigger opportunities?",
        "3": "I want to talk about defense, on the day of the All-Star Game.  You've been in the league for so long where the three-point shot has changed.  I think we talked about how that shot is shot more often than how it's defended.  From your perspective as someone who, especially now, has to defend so many threes on your team defense, what's your perspective how it's changed and what you can do to defend threes?",
        "4": "LeBron, obviously it's your 20th All-Star Game, setting a record.  For the last generation, you've been one of the faces of the league.  When you came into the league, there was a lot of talk about who would be the person to succeed Michael Jordan eventually as the face of the league.  Now questions crop up of, when you eventually stop playing, who would be able to succeed you in that role.  I'm just curious, just looking forward, to however long it is until you stop, how do you see that playing out?  Who do you see potentially being able to do that?",
        "5": "LeBron, I know you talked about the All-Star Game sort of in the breadth of your career, but I'm wondering about the particulars at this point in your 20th version, 19th version.  I remember your first All-Star Game saying you're looking around the locker room at Allen Iverson and Grant Hill and Vince Carter, and it feels special.  What is it at 19, 20 years in that feels special at this particular age?",
        "6": "LeBron, I know it's impossible to forecast what you're going to feel like 4 1/2 months from now or how deep the season will go for you guys.  But when you think about the Olympics, it's 11 games at the most, but at the same time, it's 5 1/2 weeks and a lot of miles.  Knowing how much you put into keeping your body as great as you can keep it, how daunting does that feel?  I guess how confident are you that, if all goes right, you'll want to be there and you'll want to put yourself through the grind of it all?",
        "7": "LeBron, you sometimes react on social media when a guy scores 70 points, and it's happened a few times recently.  What are you thinking when you watch that game in terms of the offensive ability to put up that many points?  Then secondarily to that, do you see someone getting 80 and 90 the way the game is played today?  In what circumstance is that going to happen?",
        "8": "I'll use the opportunity for a bonus question.  Assuming --",
        "9": "Assuming that you're closer to the end of your career than the beginning of your career --",
        "10": "Have you mapped out what that looks like to you in terms of how many more seasons?  Then does it end with the team you're playing for right now?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think as a kid growing up and loving the game of basketball and watching the NBA All-Star Weekend and seeing the Sunday game, I always had dreams and visions if I was able to play the game at a high level and give everything to the game, hopefully I could be a part of that game someday. It's just been an absolute honor to be able to grace the floor throughout my career and be out there with the greatest players in the world year in and year out. This is very humbling, very blessed, and it's something I will never forget obviously.  It's part of my journey.",
        "1": "That's most important.  Yes, I did seek treatment the last few days, trying to get my ankle as strong and as back to where I feel confident that I can finish off this last third of the season. I won't be playing the entire game tonight, for sure.  I can get out there and run around with the young guys for a little bit and then shut it down at some point to give my body, and my ankle more importantly, another opportunity to rest. I'm seeking some more treatment tomorrow going into this week, because we have quite a few days this week as well.  We don't play until the end of the week.  See how that goes.  But the most important thing for me is definitely my health, where I'm at right now, where our team is leaning.  We're trending in the right direction. Obviously, with our Laker team, it's been about health all year.  Trying to do what's best for me for the betterment of the team.",
        "2": "Yes.  I think for me, I can affect the game in a lot of ways.  At this point in my career, it's still the same way.  I can affect the game by being on the ball, being off the ball, cutting from the weak side, slashing from the weak side, running in transition.  I have the ability to shoot the ball in space at more frequency at a higher level than I was early in my career.  So I've worked on that. My mind is just sharper than anything.  It's allowed me to go out there and sometimes just outthink the game and not have to physically be imposing out on the floor for 40 minutes or 42, whatever the case may be that I'm out there.  I could pick my spots. When I need to be more aggressive offensively or less aggressive and allow guys like D-Lo and A.R. to run the team, and I can play off the ball, whatever the case may be.  Being able to have a dominant threat like AD and being able to throw the ball to him and wait and see what the defense is going to do and play off with that. I guess I'm just a lot smarter than I was in my first ten years compared to these last ten years.",
        "3": "I guess each team is going to dictate what your defense allows you to do or what you want to take away.  At the end of the day, we're All NBA players, and you can't take away everything.  Guys are going to score, guys are going to shoot threes, guys are going to put up numbers.  It's what you're willing to give up, not what you want to take away. Every team is different.  Every team's portfolio is different of how they attack the game.  If you do your scouting, if you do your research, you know players' tendencies, you can be proactive more than reactive. You're absolutely right, the game that's definitely got to, because of analytics, when that tapped into our game, it's more just like layups, dunks, free throws, threes.  A lot of teams are trying to shy away from the midrange.  A lot of teams are trying to shy away from a lot of other things that, when I came into the league, that was very important. Depending on the teams that you're playing, you know the teams that want to shoot 40, 50 threes a game.  You know the teams that want to shoot 25 to 30.  You just have to do your scouting and be prepared for it.",
        "4": "I don't know, because when I came into the league, I didn't look at myself as the face of anything.  I didn't look at myself as the next Michael or the successor to Michael. When I came into the league, the first thing that I thought about was I have to start over now.  I have built my rep in high school from my freshman year to my senior year, from being a 14-year-old freshman, I was 6'2\", 180 pounds, and I was like, okay, how can I make a name for myself at St. Vincent-St. Mary, all the way to my senior year, where I was the number one player in the country. That's the same thing I did when I got drafted.  I did not come in with the mindset I was the number one player in the country still.  I came in with the mindset I have to start over and I'm just one of 450 guys.  I think that's what allowed me to build and build and build. I didn't think about being the face of the league.  I knew I was being put in a position that I was being the face of a franchise, NBA franchise, at 18 years old.  It was very stressful, and I knew the odds were stacked up against me and a lot of people wanted to see me fail.  And I just kind of used that as motivation. But at the same time, understanding that I still have to be a professional.  I know it's a lot to ask for a teenager, but I wanted to represent my family with the utmost respect, represent my city with the utmost respect, do it on the floor at a high level, but also do it off the floor at a high level.  Whatever came out of that came out of that. We have a great young group of guys in our league right now that is playing spectacular basketball and also being great off the floor as well.  But I don't think you just say, okay, well, this guy's the next person to be the face of anything.  You have to just let it happen organically and then see what happens. But we have some great, great players in this league that can carry anything if they put their mind to it and they want it.",
        "5": "Being here.  You still get that moment where I'm in the locker room looking at Steph, AD, KD, Kawhi, Joker, Luka all those guys.  Those are just a few of the names.  Those are the guys in the West.  So you still have that feeling like, this is pretty cool. I still at heart and like deep inside, I'm still like that 18-year-old kid that came into this league from Akron, Ohio, which is like you don't really have many inspirations.  You've got to grab it from somebody, and it's usually like a family member or a basketball coach or a football coach or a teacher or somebody like that.  It's not many people that make it on TV or make it to doing special things that you think is special. When you're a kid, you think like musicians and people in sports, you think those are the only special people.  But actually it's my Little League coaches and my mom and my uncle and things of that nature.  I still have that feeling still. I was just clowning with AD before I came in here.  I looked to my left and see who I was sitting next to, and I'm sitting between AD and Steph, probably two of the best players that are going to play this game.  Obviously, we know what Steph is about and we know what AD's about.  So pretty cool still.",
        "6": "Yeah, I mean, I told myself before the season when I committed to being a part of the Olympic team, obviously it was all predicated on my health.  As it stands right now, I am healthy enough to be on the team and perform at a level that I knew I could perform at. Like you said, there's still time left in the season, a third left in the regular season.  Obviously, I don't know what the future holds as far as postseason, whatever the case may be.  Like you said, it's 11 games, but it is 5 1/2 weeks, and it's more miles put on these tires. I've always -- if I'm committed, which I am, to Team USA, then I'm going to commit my mind, body and soul to being out there for Team USA, being out there representing our country with the utmost respect and go out and play. But the one thing I know for sure, I don't have to carry the load.  I've never had to carry the load on any one of the three teams I've been on, the '04 team, the '08 team and the '12 team.  I just try to do my best and be as great as I can be on the floor in the minutes I'm out there. I'm not sure right now what the full team is going to look like, but from some of the names, I know I don't have to feel any pressure going out there to feel like I have to carry the team.  That's going to be a full 12-man roster that's capable of doing it both offensively and defensively on any given night versus any country in the world.",
        "7": "First of all, it's (expletive) great to see you.  It's so great to see you, Jeff (Zillgitt).  Love this.  And the fact that you got the last question is even greater.  You tried to hide in the back.  I love that as well.  Love you, man.  Wow, it's great to see you. To your question, there's so much scoring in this league.  You can't really put your hands on people too much.  I think there's guys that have learned that ability to get to the free throw line very frequently out on the floor.  You have guys shooting 20 -- I've seen guys shoot 15 to 20 threes in a game. We have some great scorers in this game, that when you see guys putting up 50s, 60s, 70s, it's like you're watching the game, you're like, oh, man, he either had a heater, he caught fire.  You've seen guys this year scoring like 40 in the first half. I don't know, you've got so many great talents in this league.  Would I sit here and say I think guys can score 80 or 90?  Yeah, why not?  It's been done before.  Talent is talent no matter what generation it is.  '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s all the way until now, talent is talent, and great basketball and great scorers are going to be great scorers no matter what era they're in.  Once a great scorer gets going, there's really nothing you can do. I know you've asked this question before, and a lot of you guys have asked, what does it feel like to be in a zone?  Once a guy's in a zone, there's nothing you can do.  If a guy decides he wants to stay in the zone, or you've seen Caitlin the other night when she broke the record, there's nothing you can do.  There's nothing you can do. If the game's flowing at a very good pace and you've got a heater from the midrange, you've got a heater from the free throw line, you're shooting threes, you shoot 15 threes, you make 10 of them, that's 30 right there.  You go to the free throw line 15 times and make another 13, 14, that's 43 points right there.  You could very easily make another 10, 12, 15 points from two-point land and just be at 60, 70, 80. I think it's possible.  I mean, we've seen Kobe.  We've seen Kobe do it.  Kobe -- obviously, I'm not going to put too many guys on Kobe's level, but when you have a hot streak, we've seen Kobe live put up 81.  I think it could be done.",
        "8": "Of course you get a bonus question.  You don't have to ask that.  Of course.",
        "9": "I am.  I promise you.",
        "10": "I have not mapped out how many seasons I have left.  I know it's not that many.  I also don't know if I will -- I was asked this question a couple days ago.  Will you kind of take the farewell tour, or will you kind of just Tim Duncan it? I'm 50-50, I'm going to be honest, because there's times when I feel like I guess I owe it to my fans that have been along this journey with me for two decades plus, to be able to give them that moment where it's every city and whatever the case may be and they give you your flowers or whatever the case may be.  That seems cool. But the other side of I've never been that great with accepting like praise.  It's a weird feeling for me.  I never really talked about it much, but it's just a weird feeling for me.  So to go in each city, if that's the case -- I don't know.  I've seen Mike's, I've seen Kobe's.  I've seen a lot of guys.  I just don't know how much I -- how I'd feel.  I don't know if I'd feel great about it.  Maybe the only child in me maybe. But I don't know.  I am a Laker, and I am happy and been very happy being a Laker the last six years, and hopefully it stays that way.  But I don't have the answer to how long it is or which uniform I'll be in.  Hopefully it is with the Lakers.  It's a great organization and so many greats.  But we'll see.  I don't know how it's going to end, but it's coming.  It's coming, for sure.

        "1": "LeBron, you said you were going to seek further treatment on the ankle.  Will that treatment prevent you from playing Thursday in Golden State?  Do you know yet? Le",
        "2": "You achieved almost everything a player has dreamed of.  What is the great dream for LeBron James?  What else are you pursuing? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, 211-186 are things we have never seen in an All-Star Game.  You know that Adam and others from the league are talking about making it more competitive.  Is this what players want?  Is this what you think fans want too? Le",
        "4": "LeBron, two really quick for you:  There was a social media post going around of you dunking in your first ever All-Star Game.  You doing it again tonight, kind of almost the exact same kind of signature one-handed dunk.  Big picture, to do this 20 times now that you've done it, how did that sit with you?  Also wanted to ask you about the moment you had with Oscar pregame and how important that was for you. Le",
        "5": "LeBron, what kind of improvement have you seen on the game of Victor Wembanyama?  And what do you think about his season? Le",
        "6": "As a historic veteran, seeing players like Banchero and other players coming into their first year as All-Stars, what is that like for you seeing them be established now? Le",
        "7": "We spoke this time last year, and you talked pretty eloquently about the common values that you have, one of the game's greats, with a young Filipino kid who's falling in love with basketball in a way that Filipinos very uniquely do.  I want to talk about one of those values, the value of hope.  You've been through a lot of adversities in your life and in your career.  What helps you find silver linings?  What helps you maintain hope?  And how important is it for you to be a silver lining for people who need it? Le"

        "0": "I'm feeling okay.  I definitely wasn't going to put too much pressure on the game tonight for me physically.  I want to try to be as healthy as I can be physically.  This last part of the season is very important for us.  I got to make sure of that.",
        "1": "It possibly could.  It depends on the recovery process.  So possibly, but we will see.",
        "2": "Still just my love for the game.  I'm not pursuing anything, but my love for the game runs deep.  Just trying to give everything I can to the game until I have nothing left, in the sense of just my love. It's not about the physical or things of that nature.  It's just about the pure joy of going out and playing a game that I love.  I know I don't have much time left, but while I'm out there, just trying to play with a lot of joy and a lot of fun.",
        "3": "I don't know.  I think it's something we need to figure out.  Where is the median?  This is what a lot of the games are starting to look like too.  We wanted to get more pace into the games.  We wanted to get more shots.  We wanted the game to be more free flowing.  We stopped letting the game -- be freedom of movement, a lot of freedom of movement now.  That's what our games are like in the regular season now. They let us tighten up in the postseason.  It's a deeper dive into a conversation of how we can shore up this game.  Obviously from a player's perspective, it's fun to get up and down.  But at the end of the day, our competitive nature don't like to have free-flowing scoring like that. But I think the good thing that came out of tonight was none of the players were injured, and everybody came out unscathed or how they were before the game started.  So it's a deeper conversation.",
        "4": "One, I don't know, man, it's super surreal and super crazy and just very humbled and blessed that I can be able to still perform on the stage at this point in my career and be able to do some of the things that I did 20 years ago.  I think that's pretty cool. I always acknowledge the greats.  I understand the greats that came before me and the people that laid down the foundation for this sport to be as great as it is today.  I happen to be a recipient of that.  Because of Big O and so many other great players, obviously, if anybody know my history, they know how much I admire Big O, not only for what he contributed to the game, but also what he stood for off the floor as well. We've always had a really cool relationship, and every time I get an opportunity to see him, we just pick it back up where we left off.  To see him tonight was a treat for me.  I didn't expect to see him.  I didn't know he was going to be here.  So it was a treat for me to see him again.",
        "5": "I've been asked about Victor before, and I just think he's going to continue to get better and better and better and better the more games he plays.  He has one of the greatest coaches in basketball history in Coach Pop, and he's going to learn it the right way by just being around Pop.  Pop is one of my favorite guys. The kid is special.  He's going to continue to get better and better.  If he's doing that at 19 now, just imagine what he's going to look like at 21, 22.  So a special kid.",
        "6": "It's awesome.  I remember my first All-Star Game and looking up and seeing the likes of Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett and those guys, and I was just in awe.  Just to see guys in their first All-Star Games, like you said, Paolo and the rest of the guys here, it's special.  It's special for them. I think you saw the raw emotion that Jalen Brunson showed when they asked him after a Knick game how he felt being an All-Star.  I think you saw the raw emotion, and that's how much he cares about being acknowledged and for him to be a first-time All-Star is just super cool. To be a part of their moment, because this is their moment, is something I can look back on and be like that was a cool moment.",
        "7": "For me, what I find is a silver lining is looking at my upbringing and looking at kids that are in situations that I was in when I was younger, trying to be an inspiration to them, letting them understand that there is a way out.  I was one of the kids that made it out. So it's my responsibility and my duty to let them know that no matter what you're going through, there is a path out.  If you just commit to your dream and you can make that dream become a reality.  I think that's what it's all about. I've shared a great relationship with the Philippines and TITAN and us having that -- we share some of the same core values.  I always respected that even when I went over there and spent a lot of time in the Philippines in Manila. Sometimes that's all a kid has is hope, and that's okay.  As long as you don't give that up.  Don't ever give that up because it's always brighter on the other side, for sure. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, after spending three days here in Vegas, you got a sense for the kind of fan support in the city.  I was curious about your observations now of Las Vegas as an NBA city? Le",
        "2": "You two guys celebrated a title together feels like forever ago in Florida, but what did this experience with this group tell you about those prospects moving forward?  And did the intensity of these games show you that this could be a group that has a real shot at doing it again in May and June? Le",
        "4": "LeBron, you've now played five seasons and counting with AD.  That's more than you played with Dwyane and Chris Bosh in Miami, and more than you've played with Kyrie and Kevin in Cleveland. What has he meant to your career? Le",
        "6": "You just said you know what you and AD are capable of when you guys are on the floor together, but no one from this current roster, no one else was on that championship team, what have you learned about the rest of the group over going 7-0 in the In-Season Tournament? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Has not changed.  My enthusiasm about being here post-career, bringing a team here has not changed.  The fans are amazing here.  They have everything already:  WNBA team, they have a baseball team coming in soon, NFL team, hockey team, F1 was just here over the Thanksgiving week.  Everything is here.  This is a place that loves great attractions and I think the NBA will be another great addition to this city. Obviously we see the success with Summer League and things of that nature and the Aces as well.  It will be fun.",
        "2": "I think that's thinking too far down the road.  We want to put it in perspective that it's still December.  We like where we are right now but we want to continue to work our habits, continue to get healthy as well. But I think right now where we are in December, I would take it.  I would take it.  But I'm definitely not looking to May and June.  That's too far.  There's too many steps that need to be taken still in order for our team to be who we want to be once the postseason starts. As of today, I like the way we played in the semifinals on Thursday and then tonight.  Our defensive intensity, in order for us to win and win at the highest level, we have to defend.  We've been doing that over the last few weeks.",
        "4": "Everything, especially at the later stage of my career, to be able to get a young, hungry alpha male to go out there and just do the things that he does.  It's definitely given me an opportunity to be able to not only watch as he's continued to grow, but also be able to try to inspire him as well as he continue to grow in his career and vice versa. I feel like when we are on the floor together and we're healthy, we know when we're capable of doing.  We've played too many games together, shared too many moments together, played in too many big moments together to fail each other.  It's been everything, like I said, especially at the later stage of my career.",
        "6": "Just growth.  I think every moment we grew.  The In-Season Tournament, 7-0, it's been high-intensity games and we've just grown.  I feel like guys have felt a lot more comfortable in their roles.  We've had a pretty good understanding of rotations. You know who you're going to be playing with and you know what you guys want to do out on the floor. And like AD said, getting Vando back, getting Rui back has helped our frontcourt, our size, and getting Cam back has helped us a lot.  Not too many people talk about it, but one of the biggest shots of the game was they made their run, cut it to three and Cam hits that big-time three in front of our bench to put it up six.  We didn't go back after that.  Cam has been big-time for us and I'm happy to see him thrive under this role with us because he deserves it, for sure."

        "0": "You've been in more big games than most anybody, but just wonder mentally how you approach a game like this.  You see some of the charges drawn and the focus, but what are the actual things that you're thinking about that you're trying to set an example for on the floor and how did it play out?",
        "1": "It wasn't too long ago that you said to us that this team, this Lakers team, wasn't built so that you and Anthony had to shoulder all the load.  But what can it be if you guys are playing the way you guys have been playing of late with this group?  You're starting to get a glimpse of maybe what the next four or five months could look like for this team?",
        "3": "Saturday is still ahead of you, but the typical rhythms of the NBA season don't necessarily allow for this type of intensity, this type of must-win basketball to be played.  How do you think that's going to help this team big picture, having gone through this in the first quarter of the season?",
        "5": "This one is also for both of you.  You guys have had some of your most dominant performances as part of this tournament.  What did you learn about this team that you did not know before the tournament?",
        "6": "Adam Silver has come up with the bubble, the Play-In and the In-Season Tournament.  Where do you think the In-Season Tournament ranks, and do you like putting your mark on these new things that Adam either has had to do or wanted to do?",
        "7": "The one thing you had not experienced was playing in the NCAA Tournament.  Does this feel like it approximates that experience?",
        "8": "Looks like Bronny is going to play on Sunday.  What would it mean to see him back out there?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think you just said it: trying to lead by example, make plays on the floor, be unselfish, try to make the right plays offensively, defensively, cover for my teammates and live with the results.",
        "1": "I think we're starting to figure it out.  You know, you guys have been asking me over the last couple months, what do you think about the team and what do I think we can be.  My answer was realistic:  We don't know because we haven't had our team. But we are starting to get healthy.  We are starting to see what our team looks like.  We know who we are going to be playing with out on the floor.  Guys are feeling in a really good rhythm offensively and defensively.  It definitely helps, being able to log minutes with different lineups and things of that nature, so that you kind of know what you're going to flow into offensively and you know what you're going to do defensively.  It helps.  It helps a lot.",
        "3": "I don't know.  I mean, that's to be seen.  I think we are starting to get a feel for who we need to become as a team in order for us to win basketball games and be consistent.  We know that defensively we are starting to really, really tap into that, like, okay, we got to defend every single night.  And when we defend, we are going to give ourselves a chance to win every night.  I think when you got guys on a string, you've got guys communicating defensively, you might have a breakdown here but then you've got one of your teammates on the back line that is picking up for you, it brings a lot of good mojo to the team. I think we hang our hats on our defense.  Then offensively, we want to be low in turnovers and we want to share the ball.  We've got 31 assists tonight.  We have five turnovers in like the first five minutes of the game, and then we only had nine for the rest of the game.  That's big time.",
        "5": "That the funky courts does not bother us.  (Laughter.)",
        "6": "Well, we've been successful with the first two. Where I rank it, the bubble is one, obviously.  We won a championship.  But we also had an opportunity to play in Play-In games.  I think we've had two -- one against Golden State and one against Minnesota last year -- and we won both to give us a nod into the postseason.  And this has been good so far as well to us, too. We've got to finish our breakfast on Saturday.  That's the most important thing.  But like I said -- yeah, he's pretty good.  Adam, like I said, what was that, yesterday, I said Adam is a genius.  He does a great job, for sure.",
        "7": "It's funny, my trainer was like, \"You know, one thing you haven't done in your 21-year career is be in the Final Four,\" before the game started today.  I chuckled a little bit. I played in my high school.  I went to the state championship every year, all my four years.  But once you start the postseason, it is win-or-go-home, and you can't lose or that's it. I did have that experience, but this is definitely heightened, being NBA players and what's at stake and things of that nature.  I guess you can say that.",
        "8": "Everything, and more.  Looking forward to that, for sure.  Super excited.  Super excited for that moment.  Just one, I can't wait to see him run out with his teammates.  And then once he checks into the game, whenever that case may be, it's going to be a big moment for our family. Obviously, it will be a big moment for him.  But he can speak upon that once he decides he wants to talk.  But it's a big milestone for our family, for sure, and it's another step for him on his journey in his basketball career.  So, looking forward to it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "Is there any -- in terms of the preparation that changes for you personally and just kind of the added stakes and competing at this level this early in the season?",
        "2": "As a four-time champion, if you were to win on Saturday night, would you like to see a banner in L.A. over the In-Season Tournament?",
        "3": "As I'm sure you know, there was a tragedy today at UNLV.  I'm curious how you found out about it and if that affects the mood getting into Vegas and getting settled with everything coming tomorrow.",
        "4": "Pelicans have a lot of size.  How is that going to be for you guys in the particulars of this tournament?",
        "5": "Obviously still a couple games left to go, but having been through most of this tournament and seeing how it's played out, are there any things you would like to see the league change about it or tweak about it for next year and beyond?",
        "6": "To your point, it seems like across the league, teams and players have bought into this maybe faster than the general public might have expected.  Have you felt like this has gotten more momentum internally faster than maybe you would have thought?",
        "7": "Yesterday the game atmosphere was crazy.  A lot of players have been saying this is going to be a home game for you guys.  But during that time yesterday you pointed to the crowd, to Bronny.  What does it mean having him at the game supporting an In-Season Tournament which is new?  And also there was a video of you and AD.  People don't realize how cerebral AD is with his IQ.  You guys have a lot of moments together, especially with that high-low pass.  Talk about those two things.",
        "8": "A lot of people are listening from Spain right now.  I know you are a wine lover.  If you had something to celebrate on Saturday, would Spanish wine be in that plan?",

        "0": "I don't know, just a game.  We'll prepare.  We understand what's at stake, being the first In-Season Tournament.  But I'm not adding pressure to my teammates.  It's still game 24, if I'm not mistaken.  It's actually game 23.  I'm not adding no pressure to my teammates.  We're going to go out and play our game, and win, lose or draw, we'll be all right.",
        "1": "Rest, for me.  Coming off that game last night took a lot out of me physically and mentally and things of that nature.  Just getting my rest.  That's the only thing that I'm concerned about -- or not even concerned, that I've got to worry about. As far as preparation for the game, that stays the same no matter where I'm at.  But just trying to get as much rest as I can.",
        "2": "That's up to the league.  I don't have an answer for that.",
        "3": "Yeah, my brother from back home texted me and told me to be safe out here because he heard about the shooting at UNLV.  First of all, I don't know, was there any casualties or -- first of all, my condolences go to the families that lost loved ones, families and friends and everything. It just goes back to what I said before about guns in America.  I think it's such a longer conversation, but we keep dealing with the same story, this same conversation everybody single time it happens, and it just continues to happen.  The ability to get a gun, the ability to do these things over and over and over, and there's been no change is literally ridiculous.  It makes no sense that we continue to lose innocent lives, on campuses, schools, at shopping markets and movie theaters and all type of stuff.  It's ridiculous.  The fact that we haven't changed anything -- it's actually been easier to be able to own a firearm.  It's stupid.",
        "4": "I mean, you absolutely just said it.  They have a lot of length, a lot of size, wings, bigs.  Herb Jones, BI, Zion, Valanciunas.  They come off with Murphy.  They've got just a lot of size, and they're missing Larry Nance.  But they've got a lot of size. The one thing that's been beneficial to us over the last couple games, we've started to add our depth and add our size, too.  Being able to bring back Cam, bring back Rui, Vando has played a couple games now, so we've added some size, too.  Jax came back, played some minutes for us last night. We understand their size and their paint attacks.  They do a good job of attacking the paint, putting pressure at the rim.  We've got to be ready for that.  We've got to be ready for it.",
        "5": "I don't know, I haven't thought about it.  If I had some time to think about it, I might have a better answer, but haven't really thought about it.  We just played the games.  When we've had games on Tuesdays and Fridays, we've played them.  You kind of know it's a tournament game.  Sometimes you kind of forget about it until you get to the arena either at home or on the road and you see the court and then you know it's a tournament game.  But I haven't thought about if I would have any changes. But I mean, if it's not broke, don't fix it, and it seems like it's going really well.",
        "6": "Listen, Adam Silver is a genius, so it's that simple.  So it's going to work.",
        "7": "First of all, it's not just Bronny at a game; it's Bronny, period.  To have the ability to be able to point at him and see him smiling and alive.  It's literally that simple, to have that moment with my son knowing the situation that happened earlier in the summer, just to have that -- I'm not saying I took it for granted before, but it puts everything in perspective for sure.  That's that. And then, two, yeah, me and AD, we have that chemistry because it's just bigger than us just going out and dribbling the basketball and saying, okay, let's shoot it up at the rim and try to make a layup or a dunk or a jump shot or free throw or whatever.  Very smart, and we've been through so many battles in our five years that we've played together that we can tell each other things or sometimes we can just look at each other and know how either things are going to unfold or how we want to impact a certain play or certain situation throughout the course of a 48-minute game.",
        "8": "Yeah, if you get some for me.  You bring me some Spanish wine, I'll have some.",
        "9": "Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, it's crazy to say this, but Vegas is a sports town.  You look at the Aces and you look at the hockey team, you look at the Raiders.  I heard the A's are coming here soon.  Obviously, Summer League has been here for years.  We just had F1 here over Thanksgiving.  I mean, it's a sports town.  Hopefully I can bring my franchise here someday.  That's the ultimate. Yeah, they know what they're watching.  They show a lot of support.  Sports is gigantic here right now, and they definitely support their clubs here.  That's for sure. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

What was that like for you? Le",

But it was always -- it was an exciting moment when we were able just to bring those guys into the locker room.  You know, we were just a better team right away, and it results in getting to the Western Conference Finals.",
        "2": "I haven't even thought about next year.  I don't know.",
        "3": "Me and AD were just talking in the locker room for a little bit.  I think we came to the consensus, this is if not, one of the best teams, if not the best team, we've played together for all four years.  Just well orchestrated, well put together.  They have scoring.  They have shooting.  They have play-making.  They have smarts.  They have length.  They have depth.  And one thing about their team, when you have a guy like Jokic, who as big as he is but also as cerebral as he is, you can't really make many mistakes versus a guy like that. And even when you guard him for one of the best possessions that you think you can guard him, he puts the ball behind his head Larry Bird style and shoots it 50 feet in the air and it goes in, like he did four or five times this series [laughter].  So you do like this to him [tipping cap].",
        "4": "I really don't.  It's not who I am.  I guess I'll reflect on my career when I'm done.  But I don't know.  I'll let you guys talk about it. The only thing I concern myself with is being available to my teammates, and I don't like the fact that I didn't play as many games as I would've liked because of injury.  That's the only thing I care about is being available to my teammates.",
        "5": "I mean, of course, that's human nature when you're a competitor.  Obviously frustrated.  Not being able to close out one of these games where you were in every game.  You know, two games in Denver, two games here, were winning [in] every game.  We were up 15 at the half.  They hit us with a 36-point quarter, took momentum of the game.  We still and had an opportunity but just couldn't make plays down the stretch. That's the frustrating part.  You tip your hat to them.  Like I said, it's a great team.",
        "6": "I mean, I don't know.  Like I said, I haven't began to even think about next year.  We had a great run but we fell short of our goal.  Our goal is to win championships.  That's what this franchise is about and we fell short of that.  That's disappointing.",
        "7": "Well, I kind of knew the announcement was going to happen because I shot the video a week ago [laughter] that you guys seen today.  So, people probably think I'm lying about that, too, huh?  I shot that video like a week ago, so I already knew the announcement was coming, just didn't know which day, but it happened today. Still bittersweet, honestly.  That's one of my best friends when I got into this league, even before I got into this league.  We had so many moments when we were in high school from competing against each other to sitting outside of a hotel room at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning on the steps of a hotel and just talking about our journey up until where we were 17, I was 16, he was 17, and what we could possibly do going forward, what we could possibly do for our mothers, what we could possibly do for our families if we just continued to stay focused.  I believe we was a driving force for one another.  We were locked at the hip since high school. And then you guys saw once we got into the NBA, he was always a motivating factor for me, being in the Western Conference, I was in the East.  So, I would play our games and then rush home downtown Cleveland where I had an apartment my first two years in the league, and rushed and turned the Nuggets games on and watched Melo play.  All the way to the point where we didn't make the playoffs my first year, I was in Denver for his first playoff game.  You could look that up, too, just in case you think I'm lying about that, too. So definitely just a bittersweet moment today to see one of my great friends, I never say call it quits, just to say that, you know, it's an amazing run.  An amazing accomplishment.  An amazing career.  And you know we just we'll always be joined at the hip no matter what.",
        "8": "Nothing.  I know how great he is.  I know how great Jokic is.  There are certain guys in this league that play the game a certain way, a certain way that I like to play the game as well, and he's one of them where you are always off balance when you are guarding a player like that because of his ability to score, rebound, shoot.  He sees plays before they happen.  There's not many guys in our league like that. So you already knew you was going against a beast once the series started, and not only just about his game.  Everybody gets cracked up into his stats but I don't think a lot of people talk about, like, this part of his game [indicating cerebral].  Maybe it's not talked about it, because a lot of people don't understand it, but I do.  He's special.",
        "9": "To be honest, I'm not quite sure what the roster will look like next year.  I think myself, AD, Max Christie, I think Vando has a team option, player option, something like that, I don't know who else -- I mean, the roster is not set.  Obviously that's Rob and the front office, they are going to figure out the best way to put this team together to go forward in the fall.  But it's not like we have a team full of multi-year guys that's stuck in a contract right now.  So, I don't know, we'll see.",
        "10": "It was a little motivating factor for me tonight.",
        "11": "I don't know.  I love to play the game.  I love to compete.  I love to be out there for my guys, my teammates, whoever I have that particular year.  I think it was special in the fact that having a first-year coach, first-year coaching staff, to be able to take them to the Western Conference Finals, I think that's dope for Coach Ham and his coaching staff going forward.  That's pretty amazing. For me, it's all about availability for me and keeping my mind sharp and things of that nature, being present on the floor, being present in the locker room and bus rides and plane rides, things of that nature.  It's challenging.  It's challenging for sure.  It was a very challenging season for me, for our ballclub, and obviously we know whatever went on early on or whatever the case may be.  It was cool, a pretty cool ride. But I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it was okay.  I don't like to say it's a successful year because I don't play for anything besides winning championships at this point in my career.  You know, I don't get a kick out of making a Conference [Finals] appearance.  I've done it, a lot.  And it's not fun to me to not be able to be a part of getting to the Finals. But we'll see.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens going forward.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've got a lot to think about to be honest.  I've got a lot to think about to be honest.  Just for me personally going forward with the game of basketball, I've got a lot to think about. Appreciate it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "4": "This team has been in a fight-for-survival mode for months. Le",
        "5": "Has there been any buildup from that, in terms of like you guys having to be so locked in for, what, 40, 50 games? Le",
        "6": "What is Denver doing in the series so far that's allowed them to be successful?  You guys faced them in the Conference Finals a couple years ago; they have All-Stars; they have accomplished with their team.  But where do you think the edge has been for them? Le",
        "7": "You guys had \"0.3 percent\" written on the whiteboard very recently signifying your chances of making the playoffs; you did any ways.  Obviously the odds of coming back from a 3-0 deficit are every tougher but is that belief still there? Le",
        "8": "Follow-up to that.  The only way you can win this is to make history.  You've made history so many times before.  You know the game.  Does that thought even cross your mind that that's the only way you can do it and you would like to make history again, obviously? Le",
        "9": "What's the biggest challenge trying to defend Jamal Murray, with him in particular? Le"

      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, just got to get one.  Just one at a time.  Just focus on Game 4, and you know, that's all you can really think about.  I mean, obviously this game is over and done with.  We had some opportunities but we didn't come through. So just get ready for Monday and just got to get one.  It's a one-game series for us.  Every game counts, obviously.",
        "1": "One-point lead.",
        "2": "We had back-to-back turnovers, they hit two threes, called time-out.  That was the game.",
        "3": "That was the game.  We had back-to-back turnovers.  After Rui made two free throws, we went up one and had back-to-back turnovers and they hit back-to-back threes, and made us take a time-out and we never got back in rhythm.",
        "4": "For sure.",
        "5": "Yeah, we still are.  We still are.  We have to come in obviously tomorrow and watch film and be disappointed and upset and whatever the case may be. And use that and use some of the miscues or whatever the case may be, and also some of the things that we did well to apply to Game 4.  You know, that's all you can worry about.",
        "6": "I mean, obviously Jamal was fantastic in the first half today.  He got them off to a great start, and even with that, we were only down three at the half. I think it's been the timely shots by their role players.  Obviously I think the KCPs and Michael Porter Jrs. and Bruce Browns, even Jeff hit a big-time timely shot today when we were kind of going on a run.  I think it's been the supporting cast that have kind of made those timely shots that's allowed them to kind of have the edge.",
        "7": "I mean, it should be.  I hope so.  I can't speak for the guys right now because I don't know what's going on through all their minds right now.  But I still do. So you know, it's time to go right back home and start to refuel and start the treatment process and recovery process and get ready for Monday.  My mindset is always locked in as if it's Game 1.",
        "8": "Of course.  That's the only mindset for me for sure.",
        "9": "I mean, once he gets going, it's kind of hard to turn him off.  I mean, obviously you know, he got going from the very beginning. We watched one clip at halftime where we allowed him to see the ball go in because we didn't match up in transition. And early in the first quarter, and he had one from their left wing by their bench, wide open shot.  And a guy that has that type of rhythm, and we all know, I mean, Jamal is one of those guys in our league that if you -- he'll run off 20 in a quarter or 30 in a half, and that's what he did tonight. So everyone in our league knows that, especially when he gets going and he gets to bouncing and shooting the three-ball, shooting the mid-range, posting up smaller guards. He can score at all three levels of the game - from the paint, from the free throw line and also from the three-point line.  You tip your hat.  He's a hell of a player. Appreciate it.

        "0": "Was that the ankle that you caught late and how is it feeling? Le",
        "1": "What did you feel like when Denver was hitting those five straight threes?  What's the differences in your coverages and what you're trying to do battling Jokic versus what you're giving up on the outside? Le",
        "4": "Obviously two teams playing here, you're playing the No. 1 team in the West, and Jamal had a remarkable performance particularly in the fourth quarter.  What did you see out him and what type of rhythm was he able to find against you guys' defense? Le",
        "5": "What did you guys make of the starting lineup adjustment going back to the starting lineup you guys have been using for most of the second half of the season and just kind of playing bigger lineups in general tonight? Le",
        "6": "They haven't lost a game at home in the postseason, neither have you guys.  If you include the Play-In I think you won the last seven.  Does that give you guys any more -- is that a benefit for you guys going home knowing you haven't lost a game? Le",
        "7": "After these two games what do you think you need to improve and keep doing now that you are going home? Le",
        "8": "You've been in this position before, every time you've won.  From a mental and emotional standpoint what do you take out of that that can be applied, if anything? Le",
        "10": "The dunk in the first half is not a play we often see.  The ball squirts out like that.  There was another play I think in the third where you guys got an offensive rebound and Dennis could have held for one, he shoots.  When the margins are so slim are those the plays that kind of eat at you between now and Game 3? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Yeah, I think I stepped on somebody's foot.  I think it was maybe Aaron Gordon or one of the guys underneath the basket, but it will be fine.",
        "1": "Only one of them was uncontested.  All of them was great contests.  Two of Jamal's threes was right in the face of me and AD.  The Michael Porter Jr one by our bench was right in the face of AR after a transition, they were in transition.  Bruce Brown had one as well with a contest. They made -- that was it, the three-point line is what killed us in the fourth, but I didn't see many breakdowns though.",
        "4": "He made shots.  He made shots at the end of the clock when we guarded for 24 seconds, and he made two big-time shots, one over AD and one over myself.  Had his mid-range game going.  But he had his three-point shot going in the fourth.  It's no surprise to anybody, he's done it before.  Hate to be on the other side of it but I don't feel like we had many breakdowns when he was doing what he was doing.  He made shots and sometimes it's a make-or-miss league. I feel like defensively we were really good.  They shot 43 percent for the No. 1 offense in the league.  And so it just sucks that those five threes in the fourth definitely killed us.",
        "5": "It doesn't matter at this point who starts, who comes off the bench, it's just about how we can get it done and win a game.  That's all that matters.",
        "6": "We still got to play with the same desperation as we did tonight.  We came out with an L but doesn't give us any more comfort.  We can't go into any postseason game with comfort, just because you either haven't lost at home or you're going back home.  I think it's even more you got to be on edge, because when you go home you get in your own bed, get around your family, everybody's being cool and jolly and everything.  Nah, you got to be even more on edge when you go home.  So, we got to understand that going back and being down 0-2.  There's no reason for us to get comfortable.",
        "7": "I think we improved from Game 1 to Game 2.  And if we can do the same thing from Game 2 to Game 3, we put ourselves in a position to win.",
        "8": "What you take out of it is the fact that this is not the NCAA tournament, it's the first team to four wins.  We have an opportunity to go home and play great basketball and hold serve.  So until a team beats you four times then you always have an opportunity to come out of it.  So that's the confidence that we should have.  I know it's going to be a tough hill to climb up, but we still have an opportunity to play good basketball and play the best basketball of the series in Game 3. Like I said, if we can get better from Game 2 like we did tonight to Game 3, then we put ourselves in a position to do that.",
        "10": "No, I mean those are -- obviously you have an opportunity, I mean, my opportunity puts us up 10 and instead it was an eight-point deficit in the game for us.  Obviously, that's sucks that that ball squirted out of my hand like that, whatever the case may be, maybe hit my knee or whatever, but unforced turnover by myself.  Horrible.  Especially on the road.  The same thing at the end of the third.  I missed a three -- I believe we were up five -- I miss a three.  Jamal Murray tried to save it, saves it right to AD and we swing it to AR.  And Dennis had a pretty good look, but we had an opportunity to hold and not take the shot with a five-point lead.  And instead they get the block, Bruce Brown gets the block, Joker pushes it, throws it to the right corner away from our bench.  KCP, we get a great contest on KCP from AR.  And I thought it was a great block by AD, to be completely honest, but they called goaltending, instead of being up five we're up three.  So those are momentum plays, for sure, both of them.

        "5": "You guys found stuff after the first half but how much of it do you think was the size on the court to start the game?  You guys didn't go small and they are a pretty big team and I think at one point they had nine offensive rebounds on the first 11 misses in the game.  How much of a factor do you think that was? Le",
        "6": "Austin and Rui said they felt there was a lack of energy and effort in the first half.  Do you agree with that and how do you explain lack of effort in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals? Le",

      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "Yeah, it took us a half to get into the game and that was pretty much the ballgame right there.  We have to understand that we have to start from the tip-off, and they punched us in the mouth to start.  I think they had more offensive rebounds than we had total rebounds in the first half, and you know, that led to them getting second-chance points. They also got them on fast break and killed us in the fast break in the first half and was 10-for-10 from the free throw line.  I know the game is won in 48 minutes, but they set the tone in 24 minutes and we were playing catch-up for the next 24.",
        "2": "In postseason it doesn't matter if you cut it to one or you're down 20, if you lose, you lose.  They are 1-0 and we have to come back with desperation going into Game 2.  We have to play better, we have to rebound better.  I thought we did a good job of not turning the ball over.  That's one thing we've been very conscious about in the postseason, but we've been better in transition and tonight we werenâ€™t that great in the first half but we cleaned it up in the second half.  So, we need to be better in all facets of the game.",
        "3": "Just kind of reading the game.  It's always a game between the game and just reading the game and making the proper reads. You know, they started to go to a 3-4-5, switching pick-and-rolls but any time I was involved with AD they started to switch Jokic onto me and try to keep it body on body, because AD was doing a great job of getting to that pocket and doing what he does best with his floaters and things of that nature. We know we have opportunities and we can go to other things that also can work for us with myself handling the ball, try to get in pick-and-roll, try to get the good matchup, seeing how they are going to play, if they are going to switch or hard show or whatever the case may be and we just try to exploit that and allow AR [Austin Reaves] to get going in the fourth.",
        "5": "Some of them was effort plays.  Some of them was just out of reach.  You know, we had a couple opportunities to get early defensive rebounds; we wasn't able to do that.  One of them was a block-out by me and Jokic coming down the middle was one of his offensive rebounds. I think some of them was effort and some of them is about size but for the majority, some of them in the first half, we wasn't just locked in.  We wasn't in tune.  He had six offensive rebounds in the first quarter; he had six offensive rebounds for the game.  So that just lets you know we started to get more in tune with what we need to do and how we need to block out and how we need to hit bodies and things of that nature, and I think we got better as the game went on.",
        "6": "We'll be better.  We'll be better.  We know we didn't play up to our capabilities in the first half.  I even thought in the third quarter when we were going back and forth making shots, I thought we were still in tune with it.  They were just making some, you know, shots with hands in their faces, bodies on bodies. But you know we'll be better in Game 2, that's for sure.",
        "7": "AD was phenomenal, 40 and 10, changed shots at the rim.  But he's been -- AD has been great all postseason, so we are not worried about that.  You know, so we just have to do our job, as well, myself, chipping in, everybody down the ladder from there.  It's nothing that surprised us about AD's performance. We have to do a great job of just backing him up, not only on the offensive end to relieve pressure off of him but also on the defensive end, as well.  When he's changing shots, we have to clean glass, we have to help, we have to make our rotations clean.  That allows us to do what we need to do offensively. Appreciate it.

        "0": "I wanted to ask you about AD first, just your level of concern with him after he took that shot?",
        "1": "How much a part of that do you figure now as you get back for Game 6, a situation you've been in before, maybe a little bit of uncertainty about AD, but how do you approach this as a leader going back on the plane?",
        "2": "It was a tie game with about four minutes to go in the second quarter and then we know this is a team that can go on runs, but when you think back to the late second quarter, early third that you felt like on your team's end that contributed to that run?",
        "3": "The conversation the last 48 hours has been, from the Warriors standpoint, gamesmanship from your team and flopping.  Do you feel like that affected anything in terms of the way the game was dealt with tonight on the court?",
        "4": "Earlier today you were named to the all-NBA third team.  I think this is 19 straight years for you.  Knowing what you've done and dealt with physically and stuff like that, how does this one hit differently in year 20?",
        "5": "In your career, you've played in plenty of Game 6s where you have a chance to clinch.  You also just had that last series.  Is there something you think this team this year needs to focus on Friday in comparison to the past?",
        "6": "You guys are 6-0 between the play-in, first round through the Warriors series at Crypto.com this postseason.  I wanted to know if you have any message for the Laker fans planning to come to the game on Friday?",
        "7": "Last Game 6 you guys played, you said you guys approached it like Game 7 mentality, didn't want to go back to Memphis for Game 7.  I assume the same approach going into this one?"

      "answers": {
        "0": "I didn't see the shot.  I just seen the aftermath.  But the medical team said he's doing better.  That's what matters the most.",
        "1": "That we have another opportunity.  Obviously they played exceptionally well here tonight, and we had some good moments, but not as close to 48 minutes as we needed to be, but we've got another opportunity on Friday, and we look forward to the matchup again.",
        "2": "I mean, we kind of made a run, we had an opportunity to -- I missed an easy jump hook in the lane to cut the lead to three.  AD, right after I missed the jump hook, he had an opportunity to have a tip dunk, missed it.  We blew a coverage, Klay hit a three on that right wing, put them up eight, and then we came back down, missed again, and then Steph hit the big one at the end of the quarter. We know they're a team of runs, and you've got to be able to match that, and they just kept it going in the third, obviously.",
        "3": "I just know that our coaching staff and us players, we don't work on flopping.  That's not even a part of our game.  Our game is to attack, attack the paint.  We don't mind physical contact.  We actually like the contact.  We don't shy away from it. We're just not a team that goes out there looking for flopping opportunities.  That's just not us.  It's actually never been any team that I've played on in my 20 years where we've been a flopping team.  It is what it is.  They have their right to say what they want to say, but the game is always won between the four lines, and we've got to be better on Friday for sure.",
        "4": "I guess I don't take those moments for granted.  When you get an opportunity to be recognized as one of the best players still in the league and have one of the best seasons and make all-NBA team, I don't take anything that I've been able to accomplish for granted and I'm always appreciative for the -- to be a part of any selection in this league.  There's so many great players, so many great teams, and a lot of guys this year had some really good seasons, great seasons.  To be a part of that class of 15 guys, when I seen the list, is still pretty cool, even at my age and where I'm at right now, year 20.  Just don't take it for granted. Obviously I've got bigger fish to fry, but those small moments, those small wins right there is all part of the journey, all part of the legacy as far as what I do on the floor in this league, so that's pretty cool.",

This series is different.  The opponent is different.  The challenges is different. Friday is another opportunity for us to see where we are, to see what we're made of, and to go out there with I guess the grit and the fight that we've had since we came together after the All-Star break, very resilient team, and we respond well to adversity, and we look forward to that, to getting an opportunity to play again on Friday.",
        "6": "Well, we didn't handle our business tonight, so I look forward to seeing our fans for another game in the second round.  You know, those six games are out the window.  It's over and done with.  Our job is to try to be 1-0 on Friday.  I look forward to that opportunity.",

        "0": "They made their adjustments.  We knew they were going to do that.  That's what a championship team does.  They held serve on their home court tonight. We got to obviously see the adjustments they made, we got to make our adjustments coming into Game 3.",
        "3": "You got to keep scoring, get to the free-throw line as well, or just get points in the paint.  They're going to go on runs.  That's what they do.  But you got to keep scoring, try to hold the fort down. You give credit where credit is due.  They played exceptionally well tonight and we didn't.  The series is tied 1-1.  That's where we're at.",
        "4": "We still are.  That doesn't change.  We're still the best defensive team in the league, if not one of them.  So that doesn't change.  That's what we hang our hats on. But like I said, you give credit where credit is due.  Klay was spectacular tonight.  Draymond was great in the pocket pass with the rolls, things of that nature.  JaMychal gave them big-time.  Those 12 minutes felt like 24 minutes, 30 minutes.  He was big-time for their team in the starting role tonight, too. You give credit, like I said where credit is due.  We move on to the next game.  But our defense, that's where we hang our hat.  That doesn't stop no matter who we're playing against.",

      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "I mean, that's been us since we made acquisitions with our new guys.  We've been able to be very resilient in games.  Like I said, we've been playing lot of basketball for about two and a half months now, just trying to punch our clock and to be able to play right now in the post-season. We've been very resilient.  Tonight versus a team like Golden State, defending champions, we know how great they are on their home floor over the years.  To withstand that, it's another good step for our ballclub.",
        "3": "We've got to do a better job.  I think even though late they made a run, throughout the second half only giving up 48 points, that's really good.  But we had a couple lulls when they allowed those guys, Steph, Klay and Jordan, to get some looks, they were really tuned in.  They're going to get their looks anyways, so we can't have our own personal problems.  We got to be better.  We got to be better. We love the game plan, but we got to be better as the guys on the floor.",
        "5": "For us, we've been a part of this franchise the longest that's on this franchise right now.  We've had our battles together. For us to be able to have that relationship with the coaching staff, have that relationship with Coach Ham, him to be able to trust us on the floor that we can be a extension of his, relay his commands, his messages, it just makes it a lot calming for him that he knows he has guys on the floor that has been in a fight, has been in a foxhole and has experience in tough games. Every game and every day is another learning experience for our coaching staff and for us.  We just try to make it as seamless as possible when we step on the floor with the game plan they're giving us.",
        "6": "No, never a lack of execution with us.  At the end of the day we only had eight turnovers, so that let us know we was not sloppy with the ball.  We were executing at a high level. Just missed some shots.  I can think about four or five shots.  A.R. had a shot from the left wing, missed it.  I had a fade-away jumper in the paint and missed it.  I was able to hit A.D. on a cut.  One of his patent jump hooks, he missed it, got the offensive rebound, missed it again.  They lost it around their sideline, gave us another extra possession.  A.D. had a wide-open three opposite of their bench. Sometimes it's a make-or-miss league.  We executed to perfection, we just didn't make it.",
        "7": "I mean, the Lakers franchise over the years, over the course of their existence, has always had dominant big men, dominant guys that have been a force at the rim.  That's why their jerseys are in the rafters.  A.D. will be up there when he's done playing.  The No. 3 will be up in the rafters. He continues to show why he's one of the best players that we have in this league.  For us, it's a treat for us to be able to have such a dynamic player that cannot only go out and get you 30 and 20, but also command the paint defensively, can switch out the guards, also get you five assists, as well. It's a treat for us, a treat for the Laker franchise to have another one that wears the purple and gold that's in the present right now.",
        "8": "It's always great to win in the post-season, no matter where you are, no matter who you're playing.  It's very difficult to win in the post-season. Like you said, I got a lot of history in Oracle, a lot of battles in that arena over the years.  It's definitely a different feeling walking here into a post-season game, being in the Chase Arena now, like you said. That Warriors and the GS, those colors hasn't changed.  So my focus and my respect for them hasn't changed, as well.  It's just an honor to be able to play this game at a high level, play with other great players, then also look on the other side and see other great players, being a part of that's historic, something that lasts a lot longer than we are today.  That's pretty cool.  Thank you. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, how do you view the 23 games remaining in the Lakers' season in terms of the challenges that you've had in your career?  Obviously, the goal everyone is stating is to make the postseason.",
        "1": "Physically, how are you feeling for that 23-game stretch knowing that obviously things can change?  You've been battling this foot thing.  How has this time off helped, and how did you come out of Thursday's game?",
        "2": "LeBron, first of all, looked like you got away for a couple of days with Savannah.  What did that time away do for your mindset?  Now that you've had a couple of days to think about how that game went right before the break, what are your thoughts about the flow of the new team and roster?",
        "3": "I know you're focused on the last 23, of course, but did you take any time during the break just to reflect on what the chase meant, what the record means, the significance it had to so many people outside of yourself?  And in a weird way, are you kind of glad it's over so you can focus on the playoff push?",
        "4": "Leading up to the scoring record, you always said that you had no idea how you would react. Were you surprised by how much it hit you and how much it has hit you since?",
        "5": "LeBron, this is now 19 All-Star Game (selections) for you, tying Kareem's record.  What does that mean to you in the history of the NBA?  And also wanted to ask you about you think of the development of Lauri Markkanen?",
        "6": "With the new change of the draft process this year, how do you see this will bring a new excitement to yourself and all the others?",
        "7": "I want to go back to the top where you said the next 23 games will be some of the most important of your career.  Given everything that you've accomplished over 20 years, that's a pretty strong statement.  Why do you feel that way about this particular season?",
        "8": "As you reach milestone after milestone, play year after year, how does that affect the way you reflect on the accomplishments that you've had and continue to get?",
        "9": "There are a lot of Chinese people that come here that just want to see you in person, especially at All-Star.  Can you show some love to them?  They would be so happy for that.",
        "10": "LeBron, what would you consider your secret to your longevity?  And you spoke about many times how you would like to play with Bronny before you end your career, but the way that you are playing now, do you see even an opportunity where you may be able to play with Bryce before your career is over, considering how well you're still playing?",
        "11": "A couple of months ago you mentioned that you would like to own a team, bring it to Las Vegas and so forth.  Your thoughts on that.  But, also, maybe it's two, three, four years away, whatever, but last night -- or yesterday we were talking to Kyrie, and he was kind of mentioning how cool it would be for some of the players to start with the diverse ownership and if they have the wherewithal to be owners of teams and from the top down kind of own teams.  Can you talk a little bit about that, and just your continued desire, Vegas and whatever?",
        "12": "I'm sure you went beyond your dreams with all your amazing accomplishments, but usually when a dream comes true, there's a new goal coming up.  What is your dream right now to shape your legacy the way you want it to be, and what did it take for you to become the man and athlete you've become?",
        "13": "You said obviously one of the most important stretches of your career in terms of regular-season games.  You want to get in the postseason again.  You look at how the Western Conference seems about as wide open as it's been in a long time.  You could say the same thing for the league.  How good a chance do you feel like you guys have if you could just get in, and how wide open do you think things are this year compared to normal?",
        "14": "I also sit on the brand team of Titan, which you know well, obviously.  We've had three collaborations --",
        "15": "-- on your signature shoe.  I think on paper there's not a lot that a Filipino kid from Manila and the NBA's all-time leading scorer have in common, but through your generosity of your platform and your signature sneaker, you've allowed Titan to tell parts of that Filipino story, this audacious love for basketball that Filipinos have.  I think Filipinos, especially young Filipinos, all around the world feel seen.  They feel validated by the game's greatest athlete.  I was just hoping to ask you to maybe reflect a little bit on what our teams have accomplished on those three collaborations so far.  Without giving away too much, maybe your excitement for what our teams have planned in the future.",
        "16": "Curious about your love of basketball in the '90s.  Do you recall your routine as a kid in the '90s getting ready to watch the All-Star Game on Sunday?",
        "17": "Just wondering if you could talk about Josh Giddey's game and the season he is having so far."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's 23 of the most important games of my career for a regular season.  It's the type of mindset that I have and I hope the guys will have coming back off the break.",
        "1": "This couple of days has helped, not having to stress it being out on the floor.  So it's helped.  I'm going to try not to go too crazy in the game.  I'm going to have some fun, but not go too crazy. The most important thing for me right now is to maintain my health and be available to my teammates after this break because we have to make a strong push if we want to do anything special. So feeling pretty good right now.  I came out of the game Wednesday feeling pretty good.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, it's always great to spend time with your best friend, so that's always unique. As far as our team, I love what we were able to accomplish the other day, on Wednesday night.  The worst thing for us is that we had to go on a break.  I would have loved if we could have played Friday and got a couple of games under our belt because it's the first time our whole group was together from top to bottom. But it is what it is.  We all take advantage of it.  We all take advantage of the rest.  Kind of get some nicks and bruises out of the way if any guys had them. It's not saying they're all going to just go away, but you can feel a little bit better, for sure, going into next week.",
        "3": "No, I did not.  Literally the only time that I kind of had a little reflection is when the Lakers' social media post, they posted the one with my whole family on there that I actually posted I believe yesterday or the other day.  It's hard for me to stop watching that because watching Zhuri's reaction to that is, like, the greatest -- it's so cool. If I'm having a bad day, I know exactly where I can go to fix my day.  Seeing Zhuri's reaction to that moment was pretty, pretty cool. It's not like I'm happy that it's over, because I didn't put too much pressure on myself for it.  It's not like it was something that I was -- I wasn't chasing it.  I was just hooping, I guess, and it just happened. It came organically because I've been available.  I've put the work in.  I've been gifted to do some great things out on the floor, and I just tried to apply that every single night that I was available to my teammates and my franchise, the three franchises I played for. It wasn't like a stress release or a stress relief because it wasn't something I really had a goal set of doing.",
        "4": "I don't know if it's really sunk in to what I was able to accomplish.  I know the history of the game.  I know there are some records and there are some accomplishments.  There are some things that happened that people questioned when it happened years before that if they would ever see it again or if it would ever be eclipsed or if it would ever be taken over. I know the history of sport and professional sports that I'm a part of.  So I understand the significance and how special that is.  But as far as me individually, I don't know. It's hit me a couple of times.  I was able to see that video and see my daughter's reaction, and that was pretty cool.  Just the warm reception that I've gotten from family and friends and peers and things of that nature, I understand that it was something that's pretty cool and could stand for quite a while.",
        "5": "I'll answer your first question.  It's an honor.  Any time I'm compared to any of the greats that have played this game, those guys laid the path both on the floor and off the floor for guys like myself to be able to walk, talk, run, jump, do the things that I do every single day.  So it's pretty cool being a part of history. As far as Lauri, I think it's all about more and more opportunity.  The talent has always been there since he came from Arizona and he got drafted by the Bulls.  You saw the talent. Then when he went to Cleveland, you saw the talent as well, what he is capable of doing.  But now he is a centerpiece, focal point here in Utah, and he is able to showcase not only his talent, but showcase it even more because they run a lot through him.  So he is able to do it more often. Always been a talented kid.  And I've always liked him because he has always worn LeBron shoes, too, so he has always been cool with me (smiling).",
        "6": "I don't know.  I guess it just takes us back -- it's taken me back to grade school, when you lined everybody up across the free throw line and you had two captains and you picked.  You know?  I take him.  I take him.  I take her.  You know?  You go from there. That's what I'm envisioning it being today.  That's pretty much it.  I think it's going to be cool for the fans to be able to witness that.  A lot of people who never have been put in that position or being able to draft teams and things of that nature.  I think it's a different format, so it will be pretty cool.  We'll see what happens.",
        "7": "Because I want to make a push to make the playoffs.  I don't want to see myself not being part of the postseason for two years straight.  It's just not part of my DNA.  We're sitting up here talking about the record and things of that nature, and that's all cool, but I'm more passionate about trying to make the postseason and give ourselves a chance to compete for another Larry O'Brien Trophy. That's just who I am.  That's what I'm cut from.  So I hope I can figure out a way to just make sure that I'm available on the floor every single night for these 23 games to give us a chance, give our group a chance to be able to compete every night and give ourselves a chance to win every night so we can give ourselves a chance to get into the postseason.",
        "8": "I don't really think about it.  I'm not a guy who kind of, like, basks in his accomplishments.  I've won the championship four times in my career, and pretty much after the three parades or the celebration that we had, I was right back trying to figure out what the team was going to look like next year and how I can be better the following year.  That's just who I am. I guess when I throw the shoes over the wire, or over the backboard, and say this is it for me, then maybe I'll have an opportunity to sit back with my friends and my family, my buddies, we sit down and drink some wine, drink some Lobos and enjoy just the journey then. But I'm very weird when it comes to celebrating myself.  I'm not comfortable with that.  Hopefully I'll get better.  I should get better at some point.",
        "9": "I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here for all my Chinese fans -- ni hao, xie xie, all that good stuff.  Let's have a good time in Salt Lake.  Yeah, welcome.",
        "10": "My secret?  Well, I tell you my secret, it wouldn't be a secret anymore.  But I would say just dedicating myself to the game.  I've never cheated the game.  There's a saying in sports called the \"game gods,\" and when you cheat the game gods or you shortcut the game gods, karma comes with that, and they will figure out a way to get you back. I learned that at a very young age. I've never cheated the process of how great I can be or how I can maximize my potential or how I can try to be the best teammate or how I can put myself in a position that I can help our team win. So I think that's part of it.  The game has given back to me, and I always just try to give everything I can back to the game. As far as Bryce, yeah, listen, I don't know how much longer I got to play in this beautiful game.  I know I'm on the other side of the hill, for sure.  I'm not doing another 20.  That's for damn sure.  I'm not doing that (laughing).  But we'll see what happens. Most important for my kids, at the end of the day I just want them to continue to be great -- just great young men.  Sports and all that other stuff will take care of itself.",
        "11": "I can speak about myself.  I am not fortunate enough to be able to see the full transcript of what Kyrie said, so I don't want to mix up any words that he had to say.  But as far as myself, I see myself being a part of the game even when I'm done playing. Ownership is something I'm a part of now off the court in a lot of things that I do.  To be able to translate that to the game of basketball, I feel like I could give back to this game in so many fashions, even when I'm not in uniform, that could benefit the sport. I would love to at some point down the road own an NBA franchise and be able to bring a winning franchise to a city.  Like I said, Vegas is a really cool city, and they're doing some great things in sports these days. Obviously, you see what the Aces are doing.  You have the Raiders there.  You have the Kings there, the hockey team.  They're doing a lot of great things down there. We'll see what happens and go from there.  I think it's the Kings.  It's not the Kings, is it?  The who?  The Golden Knights, yes.  Kings are in L.A., right?  Oh, two Kings in L.A.  Got it (smiling).",
        "12": "To continue to build my community.  I started a long time ago, and right now, if you ever have an opportunity to go to Akron, Ohio, we can point you guys in the right direction to see what we got going on down there with my foundation. Just trying to build up the community, build up a lot of underprivileged kids to make them feel wanted and loved and like their dreams can become reality. So we have a lot of things going on not only with the I Promise School and the University of Akron, but with the housing community that we have where we're bringing in families that are underprivileged that can't afford their own housing. That's just three things.  There's so much that we have going on, but we want to continue to build that and hopefully take it somewhere else at some point, but obviously the most important thing for me is the streets and the places that I rode my bike and walked on. That is definitely a big part of my legacy, if not the biggest when it comes to everything I do off the floor.",
        "13": "Obviously, it's game by game.  Take it one game at a time and let the chips fall where they may. I've always been confident in any club that I've been on once we got into the playoffs that we can compete with anyone, and I feel no different now.  With the roster the way we're shaped up right now, if we can finish off this regular season on the right foot, then we can compete versus anyone in the Western Conference, if not the whole league. But it's going to take a lot of commitment, which is okay.  That's what it should be about.  We're professionals.  What else do we have to do?  Make sure the family is good when you leave the house.  You have people helping you around the house.  Y'all good?  Let's commit to this.  Let's commit to this and go from there. But, yeah, I feel like we can -- if we can punch our ticket, we can compete versus anyone.",
        "14": "We sure have.",
        "15": "First of all, before we even collaborated, I had an opportunity to go to the Philippines and do a couple of things with Nike and continue to promote the game of basketball.  Played in a couple of All-Star Games over there as well.  Went throughout the city and had an unbelievable time being in the Philippines.  I always had a great deal of respect and love for Manila.  It's great. As far as our collaboration and our partnership, I think it's only going to continue to get better as we continue to not only dive into each other, dive into what we love about each other, but also about our own core values, which we share. You know, that Titan and crown representation goes hand in hand. It's been a great journey so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing that.",
        "16": "I'm not going to sit up here and say I remember my routine, but I believe the first All-Star Game that I actually sat down and watched was the -- was it '97 in Cleveland?  Because it actually came on local television, so we could watch it in Akron on local television.  '97.  Kobe was a rookie.  MJ was in that game.  It was pretty cool for me and my friends.  I think we were 11 years old at the time or 13.  Thirteen at the time. I got an opportunity to watch that game.  Wasn't fortunate enough to be able to watch some of the games before that because a lot of those games were nationally televised games, and I didn't have nationally televised channels.  No cable.  Just the local channels. I don't remember the routine, but I definitely just remember watching, like, the national anthem and just they're panning from left to right to all the All-Stars and me visualizing someday, through the grace of God and through hard work and dedication and my love for the game, maybe I could be one of those kids someday that could stand across that free throw line and be a part of a national anthem in an All-Star Game.  I thought it was pretty cool.  So, yeah.",
        "17": "Josh Giddey is really, really good, man.  Obviously, a tall point guard.  He is a triple-double-type of playmaker every single night because of his ability to rebound at his size, his distinctive passing and he has the ability to score in the paint. I think he is going to continue to get better and better.  They have a really good young core over in OKC.  They don't even have Chet there just yet. Josh is a really good player, along with the other rookies that they have this year.  Obviously, we know first-time (All-Star) Shai is really good and the rest of that crew over there. Pretty good player, for sure.  You guys should be proud. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "3": "I know you're focused on the last 23, of course, but did you take any time during the break just to reflect on what the chase meant, what the record means, the significance it had to so many people outside of yourself?  And in a weird way, are you kind of glad it's over so you can focus on the playoff push?",
        "4": "Leading up to the scoring record, you always said that you had no idea how you would react. Were you surprised by how much it hit you and how much it has hit you since?",
        "5": "LeBron, this is now 19 All-Star Game (selections) for you, tying Kareem's record.  What does that mean to you in the history of the NBA?  And also wanted to ask you about you think of the development of Lauri Markkanen?",
        "6": "With the new change of the draft process this year, how do you see this will bring a new excitement to yourself and all the others?",
        "7": "I want to go back to the top where you said the next 23 games will be some of the most important of your career.  Given everything that you've accomplished over 20 years, that's a pretty strong statement.  Why do you feel that way about this particular season?",
        "8": "As you reach milestone after milestone, play year after year, how does that affect the way you reflect on the accomplishments that you've had and continue to get?",
        "9": "There are a lot of Chinese people that come here that just want to see you in person, especially at All-Star.  Can you show some love to them?  They would be so happy for that.",
        "10": "LeBron, what would you consider your secret to your longevity?  And you spoke about many times how you would like to play with Bronny before you end your career, but the way that you are playing now, do you see even an opportunity where you may be able to play with Bryce before your career is over, considering how well you're still playing?",
        "11": "A couple of months ago you mentioned that you would like to own a team, bring it to Las Vegas and so forth.  Your thoughts on that.  But, also, maybe it's two, three, four years away, whatever, but last night -- or yesterday we were talking to Kyrie, and he was kind of mentioning how cool it would be for some of the players to start with the diverse ownership and if they have the wherewithal to be owners of teams and from the top down kind of own teams.  Can you talk a little bit about that, and just your continued desire, Vegas and whatever?",
        "12": "I'm sure you went beyond your dreams with all your amazing accomplishments, but usually when a dream comes true, there's a new goal coming up.  What is your dream right now to shape your legacy the way you want it to be, and what did it take for you to become the man and athlete you've become?",
        "13": "You said obviously one of the most important stretches of your career in terms of regular-season games.  You want to get in the postseason again.  You look at how the Western Conference seems about as wide open as it's been in a long time.  You could say the same thing for the league.  How good a chance do you feel like you guys have if you could just get in, and how wide open do you think things are this year compared to normal?",
        "14": "I also sit on the brand team of Titan, which you know well, obviously.  We've had three collaborations --",
        "15": "-- on your signature shoe.  I think on paper there's not a lot that a Filipino kid from Manila and the NBA's all-time leading scorer have in common, but through your generosity of your platform and your signature sneaker, you've allowed Titan to tell parts of that Filipino story, this audacious love for basketball that Filipinos have.  I think Filipinos, especially young Filipinos, all around the world feel seen.  They feel validated by the game's greatest athlete.  I was just hoping to ask you to maybe reflect a little bit on what our teams have accomplished on those three collaborations so far.  Without giving away too much, maybe your excitement for what our teams have planned in the future.",
        "16": "Curious about your love of basketball in the '90s.  Do you recall your routine as a kid in the '90s getting ready to watch the All-Star Game on Sunday?",
        "17": "Just wondering if you could talk about Josh Giddey's game and the season he is having so far."

        "0": "It's 23 of the most important games of my career for a regular season.  It's the type of mindset that I have and I hope the guys will have coming back off the break.",
        "1": "This couple of days has helped, not having to stress it being out on the floor.  So it's helped.  I'm going to try not to go too crazy in the game.  I'm going to have some fun, but not go too crazy. The most important thing for me right now is to maintain my health and be available to my teammates after this break because we have to make a strong push if we want to do anything special. So feeling pretty good right now.  I came out of the game Wednesday feeling pretty good.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, it's always great to spend time with your best friend, so that's always unique. As far as our team, I love what we were able to accomplish the other day, on Wednesday night.  The worst thing for us is that we had to go on a break.  I would have loved if we could have played Friday and got a couple of games under our belt because it's the first time our whole group was together from top to bottom. But it is what it is.  We all take advantage of it.  We all take advantage of the rest.  Kind of get some nicks and bruises out of the way if any guys had them. It's not saying they're all going to just go away, but you can feel a little bit better, for sure, going into next week.",
        "3": "No, I did not.  Literally the only time that I kind of had a little reflection is when the Lakers' social media post, they posted the one with my whole family on there that I actually posted I believe yesterday or the other day.  It's hard for me to stop watching that because watching Zhuri's reaction to that is, like, the greatest -- it's so cool. If I'm having a bad day, I know exactly where I can go to fix my day.  Seeing Zhuri's reaction to that moment was pretty, pretty cool. It's not like I'm happy that it's over, because I didn't put too much pressure on myself for it.  It's not like it was something that I was -- I wasn't chasing it.  I was just hooping, I guess, and it just happened. It came organically because I've been available.  I've put the work in.  I've been gifted to do some great things out on the floor, and I just tried to apply that every single night that I was available to my teammates and my franchise, the three franchises I played for. It wasn't like a stress release or a stress relief because it wasn't something I really had a goal set of doing.",
        "4": "I don't know if it's really sunk in to what I was able to accomplish.  I know the history of the game.  I know there are some records and there are some accomplishments.  There are some things that happened that people questioned when it happened years before that if they would ever see it again or if it would ever be eclipsed or if it would ever be taken over. I know the history of sport and professional sports that I'm a part of.  So I understand the significance and how special that is.  But as far as me individually, I don't know. It's hit me a couple of times.  I was able to see that video and see my daughter's reaction, and that was pretty cool.  Just the warm reception that I've gotten from family and friends and peers and things of that nature, I understand that it was something that's pretty cool and could stand for quite a while.",
        "5": "I'll answer your first question.  It's an honor.  Any time I'm compared to any of the greats that have played this game, those guys laid the path both on the floor and off the floor for guys like myself to be able to walk, talk, run, jump, do the things that I do every single day.  So it's pretty cool being a part of history. As far as Lauri, I think it's all about more and more opportunity.  The talent has always been there since he came from Arizona and he got drafted by the Bulls.  You saw the talent. Then when he went to Cleveland, you saw the talent as well, what he is capable of doing.  But now he is a centerpiece, focal point here in Utah, and he is able to showcase not only his talent, but showcase it even more because they run a lot through him.  So he is able to do it more often. Always been a talented kid.  And I've always liked him because he has always worn LeBron shoes, too, so he has always been cool with me (smiling).",
        "6": "I don't know.  I guess it just takes us back -- it's taken me back to grade school, when you lined everybody up across the free throw line and you had two captains and you picked.  You know?  I take him.  I take him.  I take her.  You know?  You go from there. That's what I'm envisioning it being today.  That's pretty much it.  I think it's going to be cool for the fans to be able to witness that.  A lot of people who never have been put in that position or being able to draft teams and things of that nature.  I think it's a different format, so it will be pretty cool.  We'll see what happens.",
        "7": "Because I want to make a push to make the playoffs.  I don't want to see myself not being part of the postseason for two years straight.  It's just not part of my DNA.  We're sitting up here talking about the record and things of that nature, and that's all cool, but I'm more passionate about trying to make the postseason and give ourselves a chance to compete for another Larry O'Brien Trophy. That's just who I am.  That's what I'm cut from.  So I hope I can figure out a way to just make sure that I'm available on the floor every single night for these 23 games to give us a chance, give our group a chance to be able to compete every night and give ourselves a chance to win every night so we can give ourselves a chance to get into the postseason.",
        "8": "I don't really think about it.  I'm not a guy who kind of, like, basks in his accomplishments.  I've won the championship four times in my career, and pretty much after the three parades or the celebration that we had, I was right back trying to figure out what the team was going to look like next year and how I can be better the following year.  That's just who I am. I guess when I throw the shoes over the wire, or over the backboard, and say this is it for me, then maybe I'll have an opportunity to sit back with my friends and my family, my buddies, we sit down and drink some wine, drink some Lobos and enjoy just the journey then. But I'm very weird when it comes to celebrating myself.  I'm not comfortable with that.  Hopefully I'll get better.  I should get better at some point.",
        "9": "I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here for all my Chinese fans -- ni hao, xie xie, all that good stuff.  Let's have a good time in Salt Lake.  Yeah, welcome.",
        "10": "My secret?  Well, I tell you my secret, it wouldn't be a secret anymore.  But I would say just dedicating myself to the game.  I've never cheated the game.  There's a saying in sports called the \"game gods,\" and when you cheat the game gods or you shortcut the game gods, karma comes with that, and they will figure out a way to get you back. I learned that at a very young age. I've never cheated the process of how great I can be or how I can maximize my potential or how I can try to be the best teammate or how I can put myself in a position that I can help our team win. So I think that's part of it.  The game has given back to me, and I always just try to give everything I can back to the game. As far as Bryce, yeah, listen, I don't know how much longer I got to play in this beautiful game.  I know I'm on the other side of the hill, for sure.  I'm not doing another 20.  That's for damn sure.  I'm not doing that (laughing).  But we'll see what happens. Most important for my kids, at the end of the day I just want them to continue to be great -- just great young men.  Sports and all that other stuff will take care of itself.",
        "11": "I can speak about myself.  I am not fortunate enough to be able to see the full transcript of what Kyrie said, so I don't want to mix up any words that he had to say.  But as far as myself, I see myself being a part of the game even when I'm done playing. Ownership is something I'm a part of now off the court in a lot of things that I do.  To be able to translate that to the game of basketball, I feel like I could give back to this game in so many fashions, even when I'm not in uniform, that could benefit the sport. I would love to at some point down the road own an NBA franchise and be able to bring a winning franchise to a city.  Like I said, Vegas is a really cool city, and they're doing some great things in sports these days. Obviously, you see what the Aces are doing.  You have the Raiders there.  You have the Kings there, the hockey team.  They're doing a lot of great things down there. We'll see what happens and go from there.  I think it's the Kings.  It's not the Kings, is it?  The who?  The Golden Knights, yes.  Kings are in L.A., right?  Oh, two Kings in L.A.  Got it (smiling).",
        "12": "To continue to build my community.  I started a long time ago, and right now, if you ever have an opportunity to go to Akron, Ohio, we can point you guys in the right direction to see what we got going on down there with my foundation. Just trying to build up the community, build up a lot of underprivileged kids to make them feel wanted and loved and like their dreams can become reality. So we have a lot of things going on not only with the I Promise School and the University of Akron, but with the housing community that we have where we're bringing in families that are underprivileged that can't afford their own housing. That's just three things.  There's so much that we have going on, but we want to continue to build that and hopefully take it somewhere else at some point, but obviously the most important thing for me is the streets and the places that I rode my bike and walked on. That is definitely a big part of my legacy, if not the biggest when it comes to everything I do off the floor.",
        "13": "Obviously, it's game by game.  Take it one game at a time and let the chips fall where they may. I've always been confident in any club that I've been on once we got into the playoffs that we can compete with anyone, and I feel no different now.  With the roster the way we're shaped up right now, if we can finish off this regular season on the right foot, then we can compete versus anyone in the Western Conference, if not the whole league. But it's going to take a lot of commitment, which is okay.  That's what it should be about.  We're professionals.  What else do we have to do?  Make sure the family is good when you leave the house.  You have people helping you around the house.  Y'all good?  Let's commit to this.  Let's commit to this and go from there. But, yeah, I feel like we can -- if we can punch our ticket, we can compete versus anyone.",
        "14": "We sure have.",
        "15": "First of all, before we even collaborated, I had an opportunity to go to the Philippines and do a couple of things with Nike and continue to promote the game of basketball.  Played in a couple of All-Star Games over there as well.  Went throughout the city and had an unbelievable time being in the Philippines.  I always had a great deal of respect and love for Manila.  It's great. As far as our collaboration and our partnership, I think it's only going to continue to get better as we continue to not only dive into each other, dive into what we love about each other, but also about our own core values, which we share. You know, that Titan and crown representation goes hand in hand. It's been a great journey so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing that.",
        "16": "I'm not going to sit up here and say I remember my routine, but I believe the first All-Star Game that I actually sat down and watched was the -- was it '97 in Cleveland?  Because it actually came on local television, so we could watch it in Akron on local television.  '97.  Kobe was a rookie.  MJ was in that game.  It was pretty cool for me and my friends.  I think we were 11 years old at the time or 13.  Thirteen at the time. I got an opportunity to watch that game.  Wasn't fortunate enough to be able to watch some of the games before that because a lot of those games were nationally televised games, and I didn't have nationally televised channels.  No cable.  Just the local channels. I don't remember the routine, but I definitely just remember watching, like, the national anthem and just they're panning from left to right to all the All-Stars and me visualizing someday, through the grace of God and through hard work and dedication and my love for the game, maybe I could be one of those kids someday that could stand across that free throw line and be a part of a national anthem in an All-Star Game.  I thought it was pretty cool.  So, yeah.",
        "17": "Josh Giddey is really, really good, man.  Obviously, a tall point guard.  He is a triple-double-type of playmaker every single night because of his ability to rebound at his size, his distinctive passing and he has the ability to score in the paint. I think he is going to continue to get better and better.  They have a really good young core over in OKC.  They don't even have Chet there just yet. Josh is a really good player, along with the other rookies that they have this year.  Obviously, we know first-time (All-Star) Shai is really good and the rest of that crew over there. Pretty good player, for sure.  You guys should be proud. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "3": "LeBron, earlier today we asked you in a million ways, like, has it sunk in being the all-time leading scorer, but tonight you were introduced as that, and then you stood on that stage with Kareem and Karl Malone.  What was all that like?",

I think it was a little bit -- it looked fun, more fun, cooler, whatever the case may be. But, you know, it's always good to try some things and see how we can get better with things.  Especially with our game.  It's always great to have an opportunity to try new formats, new ways to spice up the game, spice up the viewership and things of that nature. All in all, though, it's been a great All-Star Weekend.  I think everybody who was a part of it should feel really good about it.  And salute to Salt Lake for hosting it.",
        "1": "Coach Malone is a defense-minded coach.  I had him in my early days in Cleveland. I told him I would get one stop tonight for him.  I tried to get one little chase-down block, and got my finger caught in the rim.  But I'll be fine.  I'll be fine.  I don't think it's too much to worry about.  For precautionary reasons, I just had to take the rest of the night off.",
        "2": "You know, it's the first time for us being teammates, so (smiling) -- no, it's always great to team back up with Kyrie.  You know how I feel about him both on the court and off the court.  It's always good to see him. I'm very proud of him.  Very proud much the man that he has become in his life right now.  So All-Star Weekend is always great to get an opportunity to be around the guys that you watch play, that you admire play, that you compete against, but that you just love the way they play the game of basketball.  So tonight was another instance.",
        "3": "It's a surreal feeling.  You know, obviously, I didn't get an opportunity to watch Kareem live, but I know the history of the game.  I got an opportunity to watch a lot of his games, the replays or seeing footage of him. I did get an opportunity to watch a lot of Karl Malone games live.  To see the way they graced the court with their ability, you have the physicality of Malone's game, but he has some finesse as well with his mid-range jump shot, with his ability to run the floor and beat point guards and shooting guards down the floor.  Kareem's game, a unique game that no one has ever been able to try to patent or try to steal from. They were just so dominant in their eras.  They were so unique in their own game.  It's the reason that they are two of the all-time greatest basketball players that this world has ever seen. That moment for me is, like, I'm standing in between these guys, and I'm, like, it's such a surreal feeling.  Growing up -- I know you hear this story over and over, but it's just a part of my DNA.  Growing up in Akron, Ohio, and thinking about playing games to 21 or 33 with my brothers and my friends growing up, we always would try to emulate certain players. And to be mentioned with some of the greatest to ever play this game, along with Karl and along with Kareem, it's just an honor for sure.",

        "0": "To answer your first question, I couldn't have dreamt it.  I could not have dreamed of that moment any better than the actuality that just happened.  For me to be back here, like I keep stating, 35 minutes south of where I grew up here in Akron, Ohio, to hit the game-winner in the All-Star Game where me and my guys back in the back, we used to watch the All-Star Game.  I remember 25 years ago we were 12, 11, wishing that we had the opportunity or the means to come up to Cleveland and see some of the greatest basketball players of all time because they inspired us so much. For me to be here today, for my best friends to be here, for my wife and my kids and my family, my mom.  There are so many people that seen me grow from really a young toddler to who I am today.  I couldn't even -- I couldn't picture that moment any better. To answer your second question, to be a part of the 75 greatest basketball players to ever play, it just takes me back to my childhood once again growing up in Spring Hill and having all my inspirations taped on my wall, Allen Iverson and Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson.  To see those guys today and then be on stage with those guys it is -- you guys don't understand.  I'm trying to make you understand as much as I can, but it's just crazy.",
        "1": "You can look back there.  We're literally all kids from Akron.  We are a group of young men who always felt like we was looked over because of the popularity and notoriety that cities like Cleveland and Columbus and Dayton and Canton even gets mentioned because of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Cincinnati gets mentioned.  We always felt like we were the fly-over city. I just remind myself and remind my following and the group of fans and the people that follow my journey that I'm a kid from Akron or one of the kids from Akron that has made it and trying to make it possible for the next kid from Akron.  Yeah, that's what it's about.",
        "2": "First of all, well, I mean, Steph, come on, man.  This guy is from a different planet.  He literally has an automatic sniper connected to his arm, and when he lets it go, not only himself, but everybody on the floor, in the stands, on TV, on their phones, whatever you are watching on, you think it's going in every time.  Nine times out of 10 and sometimes 10 times out of 10 it does go in. To be out there and watch that kid from Akron as well shoot the ball the way he shot it, it was unbelievable.  It was pretty cool.",
        "3": "Yeah, because there was so much chaos going on after we all kind of split.  I did not want to lose the opportunity to shake the man's hand that inspired me throughout my childhood.  I haven't had much dialogue with him in my 20 years or 19 years in this business, but part of me wouldn't be here without MJâ€™s inspiration.  I always wanted to be like him growing up. It's crazy that the game-winning shot tonight was a fadeaway, and it was inspired by MJ.  The way he wore his shoes, the way he wore his uniform, I mean, all the way down to some of the cars that he drove, how much he inspired me.  I didn't want to waste that opportunity because we're just not in -- we're not in the same building a lot and haven't been in the same building a lot throughout my career.  It meant something to me.",
        "4": "I hope through great health, I hope so.  Obviously, health is the most important, but I hope I'll never forget this moment.  It would be cool if 25 years from now when they do the top 100 that it's back here. Yeah, I'll probably never forget this moment.  It's something that I'm glad my kids got to witness.  Then when my grandkids show up at some point, I'll be able to show them some footage of what their granddad was able to accomplish when he played the game of basketball.",
        "5": "When they said \"from Akron, Ohio, the kid from Akron, Ohio,\" that was pretty cool.  And then just hearing the ovation that I got from these fans here, they seen 11 years of my NBA career, and they saw pretty much, I mean, four years of my high school career, and some of them even followed me all the way back to when I started playing basketball at Summer Lake at the A.R.B., that's Akron Recreational Bureau, if you don't know.  I'll tell you that anyways. I mean, these guys have followed my journey.  For me to be back here, like I said, today, and for them to give me that warm welcome, didn't only mean something to me, but it meant something to my family and friends that are here, and my kids from my school are all over this place.  It's just super dope.  Super, super, super dope, and I was very humbled and appreciative of that.",
        "6": "Even with the guys, David, that was not here, you still felt their presence.  You felt their presence on that stage.  I don't know.  It would be like going to your favorite musician's concert in the greatest stadium, and you are literally on stage with them while they're performing, and the sense of \"I can't believe that I'm here.\"  That's the best way that I can put it.  I can't believe I'm sitting next to Bruce Springsteen while he is playing in a stadium in London with 160,000 people, or I'm in the Garden with Jay-Z or whoever that person is.  I'm sitting here with Whitney Houston onstage in a coliseum with 90,000 people and you're on stage.  That's kind of what it felt like for me.  I just couldn't believe it. Every time they would announce another name, I didn't even get an opportunity to, like, rejoice in the player that they had named.  It was, like, Gary Payton.  I was, like, wow.  Then J Kidd showed up, and then A.I. showed up, and then it was D. Wade, C.P., and Steph.  I was just tripped out.  I was tripped out.",
        "7": "You can tell this is the most you're going to get out of me for a long time because once I get back to the season, I'm getting back to my shelter mode.  But, listen, man, the joy of just being home, we stayed back home in Akron all weekend while I was here, seeing my guys.  Even though I see them when I come back home in the summer, we always link up.  There's just something special.  We've never spent an All-Star Weekend all of us together.  Every last one of them was here, Sian, Willy, Dru, Frankie, Brandon, we were all here together for the first time.  Then having my mom in the building and having my wife and my kids here, it's just -- how much more can a man ask for really when you have an opportunity to live this moment with everybody that has seen you come up? Let me not forget Maverick, Rich and Randy as well.  We all spent All-Star Weekend together for the first time in my career, and I don't know if that will ever happen again.  So, there's no reason for me not to have joy.",
        "8": "It's a responsibility, for sure.  Somebody did it before me and put it in a position where it was my responsibility to make sure I kept it where it was and also make it even more grand and make it better than what it was and represent this league with the utmost respect.  I'm seeing my brother Carmelo walk down the hall right there. But just not only play the game the right way, but also mean something off the floor as well because there are so many generations that look for inspiration.  It's always pretty cool to see the guys that come into our league and they say their favorite player growing up was LeBron James.  That means something to me because I feel like I have so much more to do than just playing the game of basketball.  I hope it was also how I inspired them off the floor, how to break the narrative of keeping your friends around and them being able to work a room without my presence, being able to give back to your community in a way if you feel passionate about it. I've held that title of the ambassador of the league for -- nobody ever told me to do it, but I felt like if I wasn't going to do it, who was going to do it?  I took that with a lot of responsibility, and I'll continue to do it until I'm done playing the game. It will fall in the hands of the next one, whoever that may be.  We'll see.  Appreciate it, guys.

        "6": "Can you talk to us about the scoring.  You've been able to pick it up?  What about this particular run you are on, how do you explain it?",
        "7": "(Question about Luka Doncic.)",
        "8": "Just wondering, you, obviously have a huge emphasis on the youth coming through.  There's a 19-year-old Australian named Josh Giddey.  What do you make of him so far?",
        "9": "You have experienced a lot of different All-Star venues.  How is Cleveland doing this year?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I'm sorry.  Oh, my guys?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Well, I mean, I speak to them almost every day.  We have that connection and that friendship that's been going on since we were 9 years old.  So, like I said, they're here.  Willie, Sian, Dru, Romeo, Frankie, Brandon, all of us are all here this weekend, and this is the first time we've all spent the All-Star Weekend together.  So it makes it even more special.",
        "1": "I have no idea.  I think I've taken different approaches, just depending how my body was feeling or how the season was going at that point in time.  If I needed more rest, then I'm not trying to burn out during the All-Star Game, but at the same time I'm going to give the fans a little bit of something because this is what it's all about.  Just being smart about it, obviously. I've been a part of quite a few of these games, so definitely want to be smart about my minutes and things that I play.  It's the only time and only game throughout the season where I'm okay talking about my minutes. (Laughter).",
        "2": "No, it hasn't.  We're all like moving so fast throughout All-Star Weekend.  We've been pulled and tagged on, and you got to go here, you got to go there, you got to do this, you got to do that, that we don't always get an opportunity to kind of just like have many conversations.  I've had a few over my career with a few guys.  I won't name names, but, no, that's only come up a few times in my career.  Yeah.",
        "3": "I don't want to say I'm surprised, but guys -- everyone has their own method of how they feel they could create longevity in the sport and make sure their body stays in the top-tier shape.  They're All-Stars for a reason.  So they're doing something right.  I feel like guys have their own regimen and things of that nature, but I have never been a closed door when it comes to anything I've done in my career.",
        "4": "Every season has its own mental and physical challenges.  This is no different.  This is the strangest season I've been a part of so far.  I don't want to just talk about the injuries but COVID protocols.  You have guys go out for false positives.  You have had guys go out for real reasons.  We've had our head coach be out for several games.  We've had injuries.  We've had a little bit of everything.  I mean, I've been out at points in time in the season.  It's just been very challenging, very physically and emotionally draining at times, but that's the NBA season for you.  If you are not having your mindset on that happening, then you're setting yourself up for failure.  I've always kind of known that's going to happen at some point throughout the season.",
        "5": "I love the way we've played the last few games.  At the trade deadline, the energy shifted in our locker room and I love the way we've played the last couple of games.  One resulted in a win.  One resulted in a loss in the Bay.  But I hope we can continue that same energy, that same connectivity, and as a leader of the team, obviously, it starts and ends with me, and we go from there.",
        "6": "I don't.  I can't.  I don't know.  Just in a groove, I guess.  I work on my game.  I work on my craft.  You guys have seen me when you come to practice, and I'm working on my game or before the games or off days.  I'm trying to see ways that I can continue to stay in great rhythm and see ways I can continue to get better, even at my age.  I'm never satisfied.  I can't explain the groove that I'm in right now offensively.  I guess just playing some good basketball. Just trying to be efficient.  Besides the Golden State game the other night, we've been extremely efficient, and that's the most important for me.  I'm not just out there jacking up a bunch of shots to be doing it.  I want to be efficient when I'm doing it as well.",
        "7": "Because I love everything about his game.  I love everything about him.  The way he plays the game reminds me of the way I play the game.  We're just triple threats.  We rebound.  We pass, which is the number one thing on our mind, trying to keep our teammates engaged and keeping our teammates feeling good on the floor, keeping our teammates in rhythm.  And we will put 40 on you too if you disrespect us.",
        "8": "He is really, really, really good.  He has a great pace about the game.  Great vision.  I've always loved pass-first guards who can see plays happen before they happen.  Josh is one of those kids who can definitely see the game a lot quicker than a lot of guys out on the floor, and he has shown it.  I think he has three straight triple-doubles and playing beautiful basketball. The MVP over there is Sam Presti.  He the MVP.  Josh Giddey is great.  Sam Presti, I don't understand, his eye for talent.  He drafted KD, Russ, Jeff Green, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Josh Giddey and the list goes on and on and on.  This guy is pretty damn good.",
        "9": "I just talked about 25 years ago when I was a kid.  I was 12 years old.  I was stating that earlier and how I wished I had the means and the ability to come up to Cleveland and just feel that energy and hopefully bump into one of those guys.  I had so many dreams of being an All-Star when I was a kid, growing up in Akron and having a team that was 35 minutes north of us, even though as much as I love MJ, love the Bulls, you know, just having that inspiration, having pro teams right up 77 North, you know, and having the Browns and the Indians at the time, now the Guardians and having the Cavaliers.  I remember when they were playing not even -- a lot closer, Richfield.  I remember that. To sit here 25 years later doing what I love to do, dreaming about what I love to do, believing in what I wanted to be, it's just unbelievable. I mean, Cleveland is very deserving of this platform and this moment.  They got two All-Stars of their own in the game in D.G. (Darius Garland) and the big fella, Jarrett Allen.  And they got another guy in the All-Star, and that's me.  It's great, man.  I'm Pushin' P, capital P, you know?  That's what I'm doing. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "Obviously this process was kind of -- it is what it was, I suppose, probably without a better way of putting it, but now that you're through it, $3 million for HBCUs, what did you make of the day? Le",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Absolutely.  That's why I drafted them, man.  It's guys that I obviously compete against on a nightly basis.  But guys that I'm just in awe of.  Giannis and Steph, it's my first time teaming up with Steph, and it was an honor to be on the floor with him.  A guy that I've seen come and be the player that he is today.  It was just great to be out there with Steph and Giannis and the rest of the guys, too.",
        "1": "Well, any time you're able to benefit a situation like HBCUs or give back to the communities that don't get the support that we wish that we would get more of, I think it's all beneficial.  All in all, obviously the league did a hell of a job of being able to put this together still.  The PA did a great job of backing that, and then us as players we came in and did our job.  We'll get ready for the second half of the season.",
        "2": "Head back to L.A. and spend a couple days with my family and then start preparing.  I'm going to keep my body fresh, work out, train and just get ready for the second half.",
        "3": "I hope so.  Is it enough time?  I'll take any time, obviously.  So I'll take full advantage of the time that we have.  Is it enough time?  No, it's never enough time, but we're not on the side of time.  I'm not on the side of time.  I'll take full advantage of what I have and be okay with it.",
        "4": "It's very challenging.  First of all, in order to get into the building you have to take a test.  You have to wait 35, 40 minutes, sometimes an hour for the results to come back.  Some guys' results come back faster than others.  There can be a possible time where it could be an invalid test.  You have to test again, so you may miss a workout that you have scheduled.  You may miss prepping yourself to get ready for a practice, and then once you get into the building, it's just very challenging.  You're playing every other day.  You don't know when you're going to have practice time.  You don't know as far as what the restrictions and with COVID and things of that nature if you're going to have all your guys. So it's very challenging for all teams, not just us.  It's something I've never experienced before in my career, and it doesn't allow you to -- practice makes perfect, and it's true, but we have not had a lot of time to do that.",
        "5": "I hope that they allow me to retire from being an All-Star captain, so I can retire with a perfect 4-0 record.  I'll keep that forever.  But we'll just see what happens. I always try to pick the right team, and I've been lucky enough for four years to pick the right team.  Guys go out and compete and play to win.  I've been on the winning side of all four.",
        "6": "No, I don't want to say it's a past thing, but we didn't have any discussions about it.  I think the one thing that our players do a hell of a job of always talking about social justice and talking about voter suppression and talking about systemic racism and things that go on in our communities and things that go on in America.  We have this platform, and we always use that to the best of our ability on shedding light on those situations.",
        "7": "That's definitely one of my goals, but that's a long-term goal.  My son right now is in high school and enjoying what being a teenager is all about.  But that would be pretty cool to go on my resume if I'm able to be on the same court as my son some day in this league.  The league has given me so much, and I just try to give back to it.  So if I'm able to give back the way I play the game, the way I inspire the game, what I brought to the game and also be able to give back by giving my son or lending my son to the NBA, that would be a treat for me and it would be an honor for myself. I've got a lot of things that I'm still passionate about and motivated about still doing in my career, and still trying to win championships.  That is the goal right now, and that is the motivation right now. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "Three seasons ago after you beat Toronto, you told Cleveland.com that you didn't have anything left to prove when you were asked what you have left to prove. I wanted to know if that's changed over the past three years.  Did you feel you had something to prove, and why is this one so important for you? Le",
        "1": "All the circumstances surrounding this one, being in Orlando, having a four-and-a-half-month hiatus away from family, everything going on in the country, how does that add context to this fourth ring versus the other three? Le",
        "2": "Could you sense with the mental wear of the bubble that it was getting to other teams?  And in the last few days, was there kind of a weird feeling of you're reaching not just possibly winning a championship but reaching the end of this journey?  Did that feel different than the other title runs? Le",
        "3": "What about this partnership that you have with Anthony makes it particularly special to you? Le",
        "4": "With about three minutes left, you looked over and you saw Anthony sitting there, probably the realization of what you guys accomplished hitting him for the first time.  I'm wondering, how much of that reminded you of 2012 for you?  And what did that first title do for your career and what can this do for AD moving forward? Le",
        "5": "You talk about how you can't focus on other teams and their bubble experience, but for you outside looking in, it seemed like you were locked in from the beginning of the entire journey to now. I imagine you had your days off the court when it comes to the personal sacrifice, when it comes to keeping this group together.  Is that the case?  Were there ups and downs?  How different is just is this championship feeling? Le",
        "6": "Does any one of your championships stand out in terms of the difficulty? Le",
        "7": "When you signed with the Lakers, over the course of the first year, Magic stepping down and everything that went into your start here, was there ever a moment where your mind wandered or you thought maybe the hill would be too high or hard to climb to get back to this point in L.A., or if not, how did you know or what gave you faith that you guys would get here? Le",
        "8": "You and Jeanie shared a long hug right after as the trophy presentation was being prepared.  Did you say anything to her? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think personally thinking I have something to prove fuels me.  It fueled me over this last year and a half since the injury.  It fueled me because no matter what I've done in my career to this point, there's still little rumblings of doubt or comparing me to the history of the game and has he done this, has he done that. So having that in my head, having that in my mind, saying to myself, why not still have something to prove, I think it fuels me.",
        "1": "I think they are all special in their own right.  They all have their obstacles, things that went on throughout the course of the year, both on and off the floor. But one is not less than the other, because when you're able to put yourself in this position to be able to win a championship, first thing you start to think about is how much work you've put in over the course of the year.  How much you've sacrificed, how much you've dedicated to the game and to your craft.  That's always been the most fulfilling thing for me, besides seeing my teammates as happy as they are.  Being able to know that you can put the work in, literally trust the process, live about the process and then see the results.  I think not only from a basketball player, but from everybody, whatever craft, whatever workspace you're in, to be able to put the work in and live along the process and build along the process and be able to see results, I think we all live for that moment.",
        "2": "To answer your first question, with so much going on inside the bubble and everything and us going into the unknown, it was kind of hard for me personally -- once I got inside here, I said, okay, this is my mission: I want to win a championship; this is why I'm here.  It was hard for me to focus on other teams and what other players were feeling.  I didn't engage in that.  I didn't look for it.  I wanted to keep my energy in the right space. And over the last couple days, you definitely thought about it.  You thought about just being here, how successful it is.  I commend Adam Silver and the NBA, Michele Roberts, Chris Paul and everybody at the NBPA to make this happen and to make this work.  I think we can all say from the social injustice conversations, the voter suppression, police brutality, to have this platform, have our players be able to unite like that, it's something that you will miss.  You will think back on it. I think one of the biggest things, besides the social injustice, all the things I mentioned, we had zero positive tests.  We had zero positives tests for as long as we were here, 90-some days, 95 days maybe for myself.  I had a little calendar I was checking off.  But on a serious note, no positive tests.  That's a success for everybody that was involved.",
        "3": "I can't really explain it.  There's just certain things you just know.  And any type of relationship, you kind of just feel, you know that vibe.  You have that respect.  You have that drive.  Sometimes you can't explain what links you with somebody, and then it's that organic. Sometimes, you don't even try to explain it.  You guys ask me about my relationship with AD, the first thing I think about is the respect, the no ego, the challenging each other.  We want each other to be better than actually ourselves.  I want AD to be better than me.  AD want me to be better than him.  Every single night, every single day.  And we challenge ourselves.  I think that's a part of it.",
        "4": "It definitely reminded me of it, just the excitement, the \"I can't believe this.\"   I definitely saw myself, 27 LeBron, 27 AD.  I definitely saw myself in that. And what it did for me in my career, it basically let me know that the work I put in on my craft, and the way I play the game, how I was taught to play the game when I picked up a basketball when I was eight years old, it's okay to play that way and be able to win.  No matter how many people tell you, you should maybe shoot more, you should maybe do this more, you should maybe be like him more, it let me know that the way I play basketball and the way I was taught to play basketball is the right way to play it, because you do see results. And then it just continues to boost your confidence.  Not saying that AD doesn't already have confidence, but it takes it to another level.",
        "5": "To answer your first question, absolutely.  I think you wouldn't be human if you didn't have ups and downs in the bubble.  At times I was questioning myself, should I be here?  Is this worth sacrificing my family?  So many things.  I've never been without my family this long.  Missing the days of my daughter being in kindergarten, even though it's through Zoom.  Missing my son's 16th birthday, which we all know is a big birthday if you have kids. Seeing my middle child continue to grow and be who he is.  First of all, big-time shoutout to the late great Steve Jobs, because without him, without his vision, those FaceTime calls wouldn't be possible. Absolutely, I've had ups and downs throughout this journey.  For some odd reason, I was able to keep the main thing the main thing.  When I talked about all the stuff that I missed, they understood that, too, and that made it a lot easier for me. To answer your second question, it doesn't matter where it is if you win a championship.  A bubble, Miami, Golden State -- it doesn't matter.  When you get to this point, it's one of the greatest feelings in the world for a basketball player to be able to win at the highest level.",
        "6": "Well, I can't sit here and say one is more challenging than the other or one is more difficult than the other.  I can just say that I've never won with this atmosphere.  None of us have.  We've never been a part of this.  If you've been here throughout the start -- I mean, we got here July 9th.  Our ballclub got here July 9th.  It's October what -- I don't even , October 11th now. So this was very challenging and difficult.  It played with your mind.  It played with your body.  You're away from some of the things that you're so accustomed to to make you be the professional that you are.  So this is right up there. I heard some rumblings from people that are not in the bubble, oh, you don't have to travel, whatever. People just doubting what goes on in here.  This is right up there with one of the greatest accomplishments I've had.",
        "7": "What gave me faith is that Rob Pelinka told me he would do whatever it takes to make sure that we would become a winning franchise once again.  Obviously, championships are not promised, and I don't expect that.  But he said he would do whatever it takes to make this franchise, whatever personnel changes he needs to make, any part of our organization, he would do it, because he wanted to win just as much. And for me, being able to get Jeanie back to this point, that's something that fueled me as well.  This is a historic franchise and to be a part of this is something that I'll be able to talk about and my grandkids and kids will be able to talk about; their pawpaw played for the Los Angeles Lakers.  It's like playing for the Yankees and winning or playing for the Cowboys and winning a Super Bowl, or the Patriots.  It's like playing for the Red Sox. So to be able to win with a historical franchise is something that, no matter if your mind wavers away, you can always remember what you're doing it for.",
        "8": "I don't want to lie to you.  I did, but if Jeanie at some point would ever want to reveal what I said to her, that's up to her.  It was just a special moment and I know how special it was for her.  So it was just in the words of, \"I'm proud to be a Laker.\" FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

What did you see from your vantage point?  I know you didn't have a challenge but what was it like from your view. Le",
        "6": "You talk about focus being so crucial down the stretch, AD seemed to hurt that left foot a little bit.  For you, is it tough in that moment when you're trying to figure out, you know, what can I do with him, what can't I do with him, as he's trying to fight through that? Le",
        "7": "You've been in so many of these all over the years, going all the way back to throwing the ball in the corner to Donyell, Ray makes a three, Kyrie makes a three.  Tonight Danny got a great look but didn't make it.  How do you live with make or miss at this stage of a season to determine winning and losing when you've put so much into it? Le"

      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean for me, I've always stayed even keeled.  You know, throughout the highs, throughout the lows, you stay even keeled and get better with the process.  You stay in the moment, which I am, and understanding that we can be better. And how we make the adjustments and how we learn from tonight, tomorrow in our film session and when we get together and prepare ourselves for Sunday, will show the difference.",
        "1": "Obviously it was back and forth, big play after big play.  A couple, you know, questionable calls that swayed their way and put Jimmy to the free-throw line.  Obviously, we can't do that.  He's been damn near perfect at the free-throw line in the series. We just needed to get one stop.  We felt like if we could get one stop, we could do something on the offensive end.  But we got a hell of a look.  We got a hell of a look to win the game, to win the series.  Didn't go down.  And then we got the offensive rebound, we turned the ball over.  I thought we had a lot more time than I think we even thought after the offensive rebound, and a pass wasn't executed as we would like. But we've got to be better.  We've just got to be better in Game 6 and close the series.",
        "2": "Listen, at the end of the day, you don't predetermine anything and you take the game as it's going and you play. You play each quarter, you play each possession and you live with the results.  You don't think about what could happen at the end of the game and things of that nature.  You don't get caught up in the aftermath.  You have to live in the moment and prepare yourself each and every possession, because if you start to wander and your mind starts to go, you make a mistake.  One thing about this team that we are playing, they make you pay for every mistake.  It's the same as when I was playing against Golden State all those years, you make a mistake, they make you pay.  So we have to understand that.",
        "3": "I mean, theyâ€™re vets.  Theyâ€™re vets.  I don't think too much need to be said to them.  I believe they will be much better and I'm not saying they even played bad tonight.  Everybody in the lineup tonight that got minutes gave the effort.  We just had some mental breakdowns at times, and they make you pay for it, like I said.  We've got to look at the film tomorrow and see how we can be better.",
        "4": "That's the beauty of the game, being able to compete at the highest level.  You take those opportunities and you live in the moment.  You're trying to make plays for your team and be successful on both ends, and we were both just trying to do that and trying to will our team to a victory.  You know, he was able to make one more play than I was able to make tonight and come away with a victory.",
        "5": "I thought AD made a heck of a play at the rim.  I felt he was chest to chest with Jimmy, making him change the trajectory of his shot and the call didn't go our way. I felt like, you know, at that point in time, I think it was a tough call, but they made the call.  We still had an opportunity to win. But we feel like, you know, with AD and with him at the rim and him contesting things like that, it could have swayed our way, but it didn't.",
        "6": "Well, if he's on the floor â€“ I mean he's a warrior, man.  Just him being out there, hobbled, just brings a lot more confidence to myself and our team.  We know the nicks and bumps and bruises he's played through throughout the whole season.  We have to pick it up for him and pick it up for any one of our brothers if they are hobbling or lobbying or not at their full strength.  Just the makeup of our brotherhood.",
        "7": "I've always played the game the same way since I was a kid and I've had success doing it. And I won't let a play here or a play there change my outlook on the game and how I play the game.  I mean, if you just look at the play, I was able to draw two defenders below the free-throw line and find one of our shooters at the top of the key for a wide open three to win a championship.  I trusted him, we trusted him, and it just didn't go.  You live with that.  You live with that. It's one of the best shots that we could have got, I feel, in that fourth quarter, especially down the stretch with two guys on me, Duncan Robinson and Jimmy, and Danny had a hell of a look.  It just didn't go down.  I know he wish he can have it again.  I wish I could make a better pass.  You know, but you just live with it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "We've asked you this basically every round, but close-out games you've won 16 of the last 17.  You said your mindset is about finding a way to be as desperate as the other team.  It seems like that would be so much easier said than done.  How do you find a way to do that? Le",
        "1": "The Executive of the Year Award just came out and I think Rob [Pelinka] finished fifth or sixth.  We know how you guys feel about Defensive Player of the Year.  We heard what you said about MVP.  Typically, individual accolades come with great team success and you guys had it.  Do you have any idea as to why maybe it hasn't happened on this team, those individual accolades? Le",
        "2": "Looking at what you did this year, being I think the oldest to be a first-time assist champ and being back on this stage with a third different team -- you don't need the list.  The fan vote for MVP, I think you won pretty easily.  What has this year done for legacy? Or do you think that no matter what you do from today forward, the legacy is already kind of written? Le",
        "3": "You guys are going to wear the Black Mamba uniforms tomorrow.  I want to know if you recall the first time seeing them either when the Lakers wore them a couple seasons ago or when you first got your hands on it.  And you are a guy who has aesthetic opinions.  What did you think about that look? Le",
        "4": "The fact that you're potentially one win away from going home and being reunited with a lot of people that you want to see and care about, does it make it harder to kind of prepare the same way for this game than any of the others? Le",
        "5": "You've talked about AD so much during this run, but I'm curious about the relationship pre-2018.  I think it was December of 2018, you mentioned to Dave about how it would be amazing to play with him.  You've talked about 2012 in the Olympics.  What was the evolution of the two of you between that time, and when did you decide, in terms of possible partners to do this thing, that this was the guy that you wanted to be with? Le",
        "6": "You've been a Laker now for two and a half calendar years.  I'm wondering what you've learned in that time about what it means to be part of this franchise.  And then the second is, could you share a little bit of how your relationship with Jeanie has evolved over the last couple years? Le",
        "7": "I wanted to go back to the uniforms just real quick.  Did the decision to wear those tomorrow for Game 5, was that something that came from the locker room?  Did the players have a say in that?  Were you consulted on whether it was the right time to wear those again? Le",
        "8": "As you remember when this thing started in the bubble, you were talking about how difficult it can be and was to play without fans.  You spoke at length about that.  And then separately you were just saying how rough it was to live in the bubble day to day.  I'm wondering for both things, when and sort of how you got over it or got through it.  How you were able to get over playing without that usual adrenaline rush of the crowd, and when you were able to get your own mind around life in the bubble. Le",
        "9": "Can you talk about just the social justice movement that's taking place, how guys have used their platform here, and as it comes to an end, where do you guys go from here? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Just who I am.  Just the way I prepare my mind, prepare my body, prepare for the moment.  Just having that desperation coming to a close-out game.  I've been victorious after having that mindset.  But that's just who I've become and how I've challenged and channeled my mindset.  Living in the moment and not taking it for granted and just channeling that desperation, just knowing that the opponent and the man that's across from you has that same feeling.  That's what it is.",
        "1": "You'd have to ask whoever voted.",
        "2": "I don't really think about it too much.  I think the story will be told how it's supposed to be told and be written how it's supposed to be written.  But I don't live my life thinking about legacy.  What I do off the floor is what means more to me than what I do on the floor. Seeing my kids on the back of a Wheaties box yesterday was one of the best moments of my life.  Seeing my mom unveil the box back in my hometown of Akron, Ohio, yesterday was some of the best news, videos and pictures that I've ever seen, that I could ever get. The game of basketball will pass me by.  There will be a new group of young kids and vets and rookies throughout the course of this game.  So I can't worry about that as far as on the floor.  How I move, how I walk, what I preach, what I talk about, how I inspire the next generation is what matters to me the most.  And if you appreciate my game, then cool.  If you didn't, then that's cool, too. That's what it boils down to.",
        "3": "I thought they were cool from what I saw when they wore them a few years ago.  Obviously, until you get your hands on them, you don't get to see the detail in them.  It's super-duper detailed.  It has that snake Mamba print on it.  It means something. Something more than just a uniform.  It represents an individual who gave the franchise 20 years of his blood, sweat and tears and his dedication to his craft, both on and off the floor, to make that franchise be proud of him, and hopefully vice versa. I think last year we got a Shaq jersey.  Magic did one, as well.  I think it's just pretty cool when you know you're wearing a uniform that a legend had his hands on.",
        "4": "Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  I have a support system at home that's taking care of that and that allows me to focus on my job.  So when I get home, I get home.  But I've got a job to do.",
        "5": "First of all, you just look at his one year at Kentucky and what he was able to produce for that program in one year. His ability to outrun guards, ball-handling with the smalls, block shots, catch lobs.  I remember one game, I think they were playing North Carolina and he had the game-winning block.  He had the game-winning block, I believe it was versus John Henson if I'm not mistaken, if my basketball mind is correct. That block was incredible, and they won that game. Then you just look at his run throughout that whole March Madness.  He was just beyond the best player in college basketball. We get to [the Olympics in] 2012 when he's a young Anthony Davis, and he soaked up everything.  He was not a rookie that came in and thought he knew it all or felt like he was who he was, the National Player of the Year and national champion and so on and so on.  He came in with a sponge mentality right off the bat, just soaking up everything from myself, Kobe, D-Wade, Melo, so on and so on and so on.  You knew right then how great of a kid, how great of a player he was going to be just from that. I mean, in '18, I guess it was known; don't need to be said.  You look at a guy who can do everything out on the floor versus anybody, and you have visions of what that could look like if you were to team up. Yeah, I was speaking just true from the heart and from a basketball mindset. Dave paid for it, I paid for it, for that moment.  But I didn't care, because I just know how special he is.",
        "6": "Well, one, what I've learned being a Laker is that the Laker faithful don't give a damn what you've done before. Until you become a Laker, you've got to do it with them, as well.  They don't care about your resume at all until you become a Laker.  Then you've got to do it as a Laker, and then they respect you.  I've learned that. My relationship with Jeanie I will say is incredible.  I think she's an unbelievable owner.  I think she's a powerful woman.  I think what she believes in is an extension of her father, and continuing to build this legacy of this great franchise.  I'm just happy to be a part of it.  I'm happy to have the relationship that I have with her and with Linda Rambis, as well.  It's very unique.  I'm just honored to be a part of it.  I love the history of the game and I've read so much about Dr. Buss and his teams and his success.  To be playing while his daughter is the owner of the team I think is pretty cool.  It just adds to the legacy of this franchise.",
        "7": "No, I have no idea where it came from.  I saw on the schedule it was prepared for Game 7, so I don't know where it came from.  I'll wear any uniform, to be honest.  Just put me on the court.",
        "8": "I don't know.  I don't know the exact date.  I think it's with anything in life.  Something that's different, something that's challenging, something that's uncomfortable.  I guess it would be like when I went from the eighth grade to the ninth grade, from middle school to high school.  It was uncomfortable, but I got used to it.  Or when you guys went to college, for the people that went to college, it was probably uncomfortable leaving home for the first time.  Not having your mom and dad's cooking or whatever the case may be, and now you're in a dorm room trying to figure this out.  But you figure it out. It's human.  It's just human growth.  It's a human mindset.  It's a growth mindset.  You just figure it out.  I kept the main thing the main thing, and everything else took care of itself.  You control what you can control.  What you cannot control, you don't worry about.",
        "9": "We know that being here has given us the strength and the numbers.  You could take that from the Golden State Warriors: There's strength in numbers.  That's a byproduct of us being here, of being able to use this platform to be able to talk about everything that's going on outside of the court.  All the social injustice and the voter suppression and so many other things that are just going on, the police brutality and so on and so on and so on.  Being here and having the opportunity to talk about these issues and continuing to understand that this world is not just about basketball, even though we live in a small piece of the game of basketball.  There are so many bigger things and so many greater things going on.  If you can make an impact or you can make a change or you can have a vision, it just helps out so much not only in your community but all over the world. Where do we go from here?  We don't stop.  Obviously, when the season ends in less than a week, everyone disperses and goes back. But I hope people continue to use their platform.  Use their individual social media platforms, if they're doing it that way, or if you are an individual that goes into your community and does it that way.  However you can continue to create change for the better of all of us, it only makes us all better.  It doesn't matter what race you are, it doesn't matter what color you are, no matter how tall or whatever the case may be, because we all want to see better days.  No matter if you agree or don't agree with some of the things that are going on, I think we'd all love to see better days and see more love than hate. I know I do my part, as much as I do, on continuing to create change, continuing to educate, continuing to enlighten my community and communities all over the world that listen to me and follow me throughout my journey.  Like I said, you control what you can control, and what you can't, sometimes as much as it hurts, you just try not to worry about it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "Just wanted to ask you about KCP down the stretch.  You grabbed a rebound off Jimmy's miss, pushed in transition, see him in the corner.  All the teammates you've had, you know which guys are going to be capable for those moments in a Finals game.  What do you think of his effort overall? Le",
        "1": "I think it was after Game 2 that you made the comment that it's not just enough to win the game, you guys want to be great.  This game was one where defensively you were great, and then there was a lot of sloppiness early offensively with the turnovers.  I'm just wondering if there's a certain point where you stop striving for that winning in a great way, and it's just enough to get the wins?  Or is that not until the fourth win? Le",
        "2": "You guys took a five-point lead to the fourth quarter and won the game, which made you as a team 56-0 this season taking a lead into the fourth.  What does that say about the makeup of your team, and do you take any pride in being on a team that can possess that stat? Le",
        "3": "I know you talked about AD's great games and that that's who AD is, but in the last two days, from where he sort of told us after Game 3 he felt like he could have been more aggressive, to the guy he was after hitting that shot, 39 seconds left, beating his chest, what did you see in him getting back to that place where he be the player that he can be? Le",
        "4": "This game, being tied back and forth the entire time, came down to moments of truth.  You guys won more than they did at the end of the day.  When AD hits that shot, and you're doing the Ric Flair and screaming, is there a different kind of satisfaction, when y'all are so tight all night long and you have a breakthrough at that point? Le",
        "5": "What does an extra day of rest mean in a very physical series like this, and does it matter more to you now than it used to? Le",
        "6": "I believe it's like the third game of this series where you guys have called for a challenge in the first half.  You got it overturned, the right call.  How do you weigh the pros and cons of doing it so early? Le",
        "7": "You mentioned the fourth quarter being winning time.  You played just about every second of the fourth quarter in this series.  Given the score, are you predetermined you're going to play all 12 minutes?  And what is it about the fourth quarter and your sense of urgency that might be a little different than the previous three quarters? Le",
        "8": "KCP and Markieff both talked about a text that you sent that this was a must-win game.  What was it about today that prompted you to do that? Le",
        "9": "Anthony's versatility on defense is a weapon that allowed Frank to make the switch and say he can start possessions on Butler.  AD's ability to do that, and still get back to protect the rim and to still deter shots, is it kind of unmatched? Le",
        "10": "This is your 258th playoff game.  I'm wondering, how much have you come to enjoy the adjustment game to game that you have to make when you're in the playoffs, against good teams with good coaches that you know? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "At the end of the day, if you're on the floor at crunch time, then I believe in you.  Whoever is out on the floor with me, I believe can make plays, and tonight was a case in point of KCP.  Stays ready.  He works on his craft.  Like you said, that three in front of their bench was a huge three, and obviously the drive at the end of the shot clock was two big back-to-back plays in the fourth quarter, where we needed to continue to score versus this team.",
        "1": "It's kind of two different things, two different points you're making.  You never stop striving to be perfect or be great.  And you know that a perfect game is not going to happen, but that don't mean you still don't strive to be as great as you can be every night. Now, every game has its own adjustments and things of that nature, and tonight was one of those games where we had to win on the defensive end and make some timely shots.  But I think when you start thinking like, okay, well, I can't be great tonight or we can't be great tonight, okay, we just have to figure it out, then you sell yourself short.  Me personally, I would never do that as long as I lace them up and put on a uniform.  But I love what we did tonight.",
        "2": "I think the fourth quarter, obviously it's winning time.  You've got 12 minutes to buckle down defensively with the lead, kind of hold that lead, and then you have to execute offensively.  Obviously, I didn't know the stat coming into tonight.  But for us, that's just the mindset.  We've got 12 minutes.  If we have the lead, it's our job to outscore the opponent or to hold them to [as many] points as us, which is the same exact thing, because if we win the quarter, we win the game. That's kind of been our mindset all year long.",
        "3": "He's a big shot-maker late in the shot clock, early in the shot clock, fourth quarter, first quarter, everything in between.  It was just a great set up by Do [Rajon Rondo].  The possession before that, Do was able to fake it like he was going back to him, carry himself into the lane and get a layup.  And then the very next possession, he was able to find him and AD just kind of stared at the shot clock, knew it was late in the shot clock and obviously trusted his shot that he works on consistently. So big-time shot, big-time play for our team to be able to put the game away.",
        "4": "You kind of know momentum plays and momentum shots, the score and the time, what's going on within the last few possessions.  They were going back and forth with us, and we were going back and forth with them.  Duncan Robinson hits one off the glass at the end of the shot clock for a three.  Bam hits one off the glass right there before that we thought possibly went out; obviously it didn't count.  Herro hit some big shots.  Me and Do had a clean rebound, we're both going for it and we smash each other in the paint.  They kick it out to Jae Crowder and he hits a shot. To be able to get some stops and then make a timely shot, up six, you know if you make that shot, that three to put you up nine at that point in time of the game, then you know that you want to get one more stop obviously, but you have the time on your side because it's a three-possession game with 39 seconds.  Most veteran ballclubs will be able to survive that. Just a big-time play, big-time moment not only for AD but for our ballclub and our franchise.",
        "5": "No.  I mean, for me, it doesn't matter.  I can go every other day if that's the case.  But I'm going to take full advantage of it.  Gives me an opportunity to continue to get my body right, my mind, everything in between.  I'll take full advantage of it, but it does nothing for me besides just getting a little extra day -- I guess it does.  I guess it does do some, but it's not needed for me personally.",
        "6": "There's certain momentum plays throughout the first half.  There's a certain rhythm that you have either offensively or defensively that if that call is made correctly, then you continue to stay in that zone.  You continue to stay in that rhythm.  And if the call is wrong, it can throw you off of your rhythm. So we've wanted to challenge some things in the first half that we just felt like, okay, even if we were right, maybe that's not the time; we've still got our rhythm, we're good, whatever the case may be.  But we felt like in that particular moment, we were playing some really good basketball.  We were defending at a high level, and we knew for sure, we knew 100 percent, because I was guarding the ball, I knew for sure I didn't touch the ball.  Herro tried to float it over me and it hit the backboard, then hit the wire. Coach is always kind of like, you know, 50/50 about it, and obviously as a player on the floor, you hate to tell your coach to challenge when you're not 100 percent.  But I was for sure 100 percent about that play.",
        "7": "For me, I mean, at this point in the season, I don't care about rest.  I really don't.  I don't care about sleep.  I don't care about resting throughout the game.  Obviously, I come out of the game.  Coach has a rhythm and rotation that we live by and we go by.  But I don't care about resting because I can rest in a week, max, if it happens to go there.  I could rest for a month straight, which I won't do because of who I am; you guys know that.  But I can rest then.  I can sleep eight hours and get up and eat and then go right back to sleep if I want to.",
        "8": "When I woke up from my nap this morning after our team meeting, I just felt that.  I felt that vibe.  I felt that pressure.  I felt like for me personally, this was one of the biggest games of my career.  I just wanted to relay that message to my teammates, the type of zone I was in, the type of moment it was, and the kind of team we were playing against.  After the Game 3 win, that confidence they had, the confidence they still have even after tonight's loss.  They are just a gritty, so damn-well-coached team. I feel like if we're going to be a championship ballclub, if we want to really be a championship team, that we got to have that same grit and that same attitude.  It was my mindset.  I'm still in it.  You can see my mind kind of working right now.",
        "9": "Yeah, that's why he's the Defensive Player of the Year.  We said that all year.  His ability to play one through five, guard anybody on the floor, take the challenge, not only guard on the perimeter, continue to protect the paint.  Guards drive on him.  It's hard to score on him.  You see how high Herro threw that ball up?  It went in, but he had to throw that thing up to the skyscrapers, right?  That guy can do everything defensively.  Guarding the ball, guard the post, slide his feet with guards, contest, can body up with bigs.  I mean, need I say more?",
        "10": "I think that's the best part.  That's the best part.  I get so excited -- like right now, I'm excited about our meeting tomorrow watching film and breaking that down and seeing things that we can do better.  Seeing things that we did do well.  Thinking about the adjustments that they possibly or will do, because I know Spo going into Game 5.  That's the best part about it.  It's a chess match. When you get to this point in your career, having your mind at a high level is so much more than the physical because we're all -- at this point, we're all great players.  We're all here for a reason.  We're in the Finals, Both conferences, anybody that is on the floor, they are on the floor for a reason. To be able to think through the game and understand and see the adjustments and try to make plays before plays even seem like they are going to be possible, that's the best part for me personally.

        "2": "Specifically with Anthony, when he's had off nights or what have you, he's always responded in a really big way.  He's talked about you always kind of knowing how to approach him after a night when he's struggled.  What's your approach been with him today and what do you expect from him tomorrow? Le",
        "3": "You've been in the Finals 10 times now.  You've been up in series, you've been down in series.  What's it like to process the time off in between games coming off a loss? Le",
        "4": "You're wearing a \"More Than a Vote\" shirt right now. In terms of trying to influence change, thinking back eight years ago when you wore those hoodies as a statement of Trayvon Martin, what are the biggest things you've learned about impacting change off the court?  Is there advice you now would have given yourself eight years ago when you kind of started this journey? Le",
        "5": "In terms of talking to opponents on the floor, are you a guy who just responds to trash talk?  Do you initiate it?  As your status has moved up in the league, has it changed?  Have different players said different things or do they not want to talk to you because they don't want to get you going?  How does that equation go? Le",
        "6": "From just a strategy standpoint, Bam is the type of big who is obviously a really great playmaker but he doesn't space the floor so much with his shooting.  The guys that Miami plays at the position now, Meyers and Olynyk, both do.  How much different does that force you guys to be defensively?  You talked about those defensive breakdowns last night.  I imagine spacing had something to do with a couple of them. Le",
        "7": "You've always prided yourself on playing the right way.  You still have those moments like the fourth quarter against Denver in the close-out game where you're like, this is going to end now and you go to that place.  Jimmy parallels you in that regard in that he doesn't want to have the ball in his hands every possession; he wants to get other guys involved.  And then you saw last night what he ends up doing.  Are you in that space yet where you think you might have to go that tack to close this thing out and go to that fourth-quarter-Bron-against-Denver mode, like we've seen so many times from you in the past?  Or are you not there yet? Le",
        "8": "Early in the pandemic you mentioned that your body was kind of in shock, that you were rounding toward third base for the playoffs and then you had to stop.  All these months later, how would you say your body has responded to all that? Le"

        "0": "Our turnovers.  Our turnovers really killed us.  We understand that we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  We also had some breakdowns defensively throughout the course of the game that we're not accustomed to having.  Those will be cleaned up in Game 4.",
        "1": "We're able to take a loss and understand why we lost. Understand things that we should have done better and things that we can apply to the next game to be better.  We're right back at that moment once again with the opportunity to be better than we were in the game before. Look forward to the opportunity tomorrow night.",
        "2": "I expect him to be AD.  I'm looking forward to getting out on the floor with him once again tomorrow night.",
        "3": "Pretty much the same coming off a win for me.  Until the series is completed, I kind of stay on edge, stay locked in on the job at hand.  Obviously, no one wants to ever lose.  You hate that feeling, especially when you know you didn't play your best, and I definitely wasn't at my best last night from an individual standpoint.  So I take that responsibility and I take that with a lot of passion and understanding of how I can be much better in the following game. Throughout the postseason, I stay even keel.  As I've grown in this game and I've grown over the years, I kind of stay even keel, understanding that there's always another opportunity to get better.  We have that opportunity today and also tomorrow night in the game.",
        "4": "That you can't get caught up in what everybody else thinks, because everyone is not going to always agree with your movement.  Everyone is not going to agree with your words.  Everyone is not going to agree with your passion.  Everyone is not going to always agree with why you're doing it, things of that nature.  If you're true to it and it hits home and it hits the heart, then it shouldn't matter.  And it doesn't, because you have the knowledge and you have the passion and you have the support to be able to shed light on situations that you feel are either unjust or wrong. There's a thing called common sense.  You know the difference between right and wrong.  It's something I've always grew up on.  My mother always told me [about] being able to understand the difference between right and wrong and noticing it and being able to have that feeling.  To sit back and think eight years ago when we sat in Detroit in the ballroom as a part of the Miami Heat team, and we all decided to put our hoodies on in a reflection, in a remembrance of Trayvon Martin and that tragic incident, we knew that it was going to be uncomfortable to a lot of people.  But we didn't care, because we understood how much it hit home for us and a lot of our guys having sons of their own.  We could imagine if our kid was to leave home and not return.  I think that's what it boils down to.",
        "5": "No, I've always been a guy who kind of let his game do the talking.  But when guys get to talking, I can do that, as well.  I've always tried to let my game do the talking. Some guys like to talk their way through the basketball game.  I think it helps them out personally.  There's always communication going on on the floor.  For me personally, as long as it doesn't get disrespectful, I'm fine with it. But I've never really started up a trash-talking dialogue.  That's just not me.  I believe the way I play the game is enough trash talking in itself.",
        "6": "I think it all boils down to, no matter who's in the lineup for those guys, they're a great team. It's just that simple.  They're going to put you in positions that may feel uncomfortable, that will be uncomfortable, throughout the course of 48 minutes, and we have to be able to adjust.  There's things that Meyers and Kelly do that Bam doesn't do, but we also understand that there's things Bam does that not too many guys in this league can do.  They create different challenges depending on who's out on the floor. When there's five guys out on the floor for the Miami Heat, they're going to play how they play.  They're going to move the ball, they're going to move with pace, they're going to share the ball.  They've got guys that can get into the paint.  They've got guys that can shoot threes.  They've got guys that command double teams and things of that nature.  It doesn't matter who's out on the floor for them; they're going to be playing at a high level because that's just the way they are.  They're extremely well-coached from top to bottom.",
        "7": "I've never predetermined my game plan throughout my whole career.  I've never gone into a game saying, okay, I need to score 40 tonight, I need to dominate in the scoring facet, things of that nature, I need to make big shots.  I've never predetermined my game.  Throughout my whole life, I've never done that.  One thing I've always been, I've always been prepared.  If you're prepared, then whatever the game -- however the course happens, you're able to make adjustments throughout the game and you're able to impact the game because you're prepared and you've put in the work.  It's just that simple for me. I think anytime I've ever thought about, okay, I'm going to try to go out and do this, it doesn't happen that way.  The game has too many things that can happen throughout the course of the game and throughout the course of a quarter or possessions here and possessions there where you can try to plan for it, but audibles happen in the football sense. The best thing I can tell you is that I'm always prepared and I know that I've put in the work.  I trust that.",

        "3": "Despite seemingly Miami controlling the action, holding the lead for most of the start of the game, you guys took a lead around nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter.  From there on, what do you think allowed them to separate from you guys? Le",
        "4": "You guys obviously had a chance to take a 3-0 lead.  Are you concerned about giving Miami a breath of fresh air?  And with the possibility of Bam returning in the next game, do you feel like an opportunity missed that way? Le",
        "5": "When you guys have lost games this postseason, you've responded very well.  What is it about this group that's handled quick adjustments that has bounced back from losses so well in these playoffs? Le",
        "6": "It's usually pretty fun when you and Jimmy play against each other over the years.  Would you say that you enjoy playing against him?  You respect playing against him?

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We know that we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They are very active defensively.  It starts with myself, being the starting point guard of the team, having five first-half turnovers, eight total for the game. Can't do that, obviously, because it gives them more possessions and doesn't allow us to set our defense.  They are really, really good offensively, so you just can't turn the ball over against that team. I take full responsibility for that.",
        "1": "I thought Jimmy was phenomenal.  He did everything that they needed him to do tonight and he came through big time in a big-time game.  We'll watch film and see ways we can be better going into Game 4.  But I thought he was great.",
        "2": "I mean, you just said it, he got into some foul trouble.  You know, they even -- one of the shots he made when he had four fouls, they still tried to slide underneath him and get him a fifth in the third.  I think the foul trouble made him a little passive, because he wanted to be out on the floor but he couldn't be his aggressive self offensively and defensively.  I think the fouls slowed him down a lot tonight.",
        "3": "They continued to make shots, and we had some turnovers.  We didn't make shots.  They came out and executed after we took the lead.  Jimmy, like I said, he had his hand on all those plays pretty much. Obviously, we have to do a better job of that coming down the stretch.  But I like our fight tonight, even as poorly as I believe we played.",
        "4": "When you have an opportunity and you don't make the most of it, then you come back the next time.  I mean, it's not like the series was over if we won tonight.  We know for sure that Miami is never going to quit, no matter if we won tonight and they go into a Game 4, 3-0.  I know how resilient that bunch is and how resilient that coaching staff is and their franchise.  I don't ever feel like we let our guard down.  Also, I don't feel like we're concerned.  We're not concerned.  We know we can play a lot better.  We have another opportunity to take a commanding lead on Tuesday.  You relish that opportunity.",
        "5": "We learn from our mistakes pretty quick.  You know, obviously right now with the games being every other day pretty much, it's the film room.  It's the film room and it's how well we can make adjustments from the film and take it to the floor, and we have done a great job throughout this postseason.  So we are going to definitely have to do that because we're playing against a very, very, very, very good team.  We have to learn from our mistakes and be better on Tuesday.",
        "6": "Love it.  Love it.  One of the best competitors we have in our game.  We love that opportunity.  For me personally, I don't know how many more opportunities I'm going to have, so to be able to go against a fierce competitor like that is something I'll look back on when I'm done playing.  I'll miss those moments.",
        "7": "Both.",
        "8": "I just think we can be better, obviously.  I don't think we started the game defensively in tune, and then offensively taking care of the ball.  Like I said, we had some careless turnovers.  It starts with me, like I said, and I take full responsibility for that.  I'll be a lot better on Tuesday with that, understanding that they are very good with their hands.  They are very good with the stripping.  You can't allow this team to have extra possessions.  You can't turn the ball over at that high a rate, especially at this point in the season, as well. I'll be a lot better with the security of the ball and the turnovers and things of that nature.  We as a team will be a lot better defensively with our game plan. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "I believe you would have just finished your junior year in high school, 2002, Kobe and Shaq both go for 30-plus against the Nets, Game 3 of the Finals.  You were drafted the next year.  You and AD, first time Lakers teammates have done that since then.  Wondered your thoughts on the Kobe-Shaq dynamic and what it's like going through a game like today with AD, especially at a similar level of efficiency. Le",
        "1": "AD and Frank indicated that even though it's a win, they were not totally happy with how things went defensively, especially Frank had mentioned that.  Do you agree, and if so, what concerns you? Le",
        "2": "Shaq's a big post presence, a five as much as a five can be.  Kobe, perimeter, all that.  You and AD seem to have elements maybe of a bit of both of their games.  I don't know if you would agree with that, but if you do, could you describe how maybe both of you are a bit of a hybrid of what those guys brought to the court? Le",
        "3": "After the Heat timeout with UD, it seemed like there was a turn in momentum and they started attacking aggressively.  What do you know about UD that makes him impactful to a bench of players like that, even though he himself is not playing in the game? Le",
        "4": "You used the word \"force\" probably six or seven times in the first two answers today.  How important has your team's ability to play with force made a difference in these first two games? Le",
        "5": "When you guys advanced past Denver, Frank was talking about the relationship he has with you, and he said that the buy-in that you had with him as a coach and the immediacy of that buy-in did a lot for this team and where you are right now.  What was it about Frank that gave that you immediate buy-in and that you gravitated toward? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "You know, obviously being in high school, watching the Kobe-Shaq duo was the most dominant duo that I have personally seen in my life from a basketball perspective.  Obviously we knew the force that Shaq brought to the table, but the elegance and force that Kobe played with, as well. They were very dominant in what they did on the floor, on both sides of the floor.  So to be in the conversation with those two guys, myself and Anthony, myself and AD -- he's going to kill me -- myself and AD, is just very humbling, because I know I grew up watching those guys.  I grew up admiring Kobe; obviously, a kid coming straight out of high school.  Admired that, as a kid when I was young, and obviously got the opportunity.  And the force that Shaq played with.  It's very humbling that we can be even mentioned with those greats.",
        "1": "I definitely agree.  Myself, Coach and AD were not happy with our defensive presence tonight.  We know we can be a lot better and we're just, myself and AD, we're not satisfied with just the win.  We want to be great.  We want to be great, as close to 48 minutes as possible. I know I said it after Game 1, but I'm extremely excited to watch the film tomorrow, as well as a group, to see ways we can be better.  We're playing against a very dangerous team in Miami, where they have five guys on the floor that's a threat, as they have shown tonight. So we have to continue to stay on our P's and Q's and cross our T's and dot our I's throughout the course of a game, and if we have a breakdown, being able to cover for one another.  But they do a great job of putting your defense in positions that you may not be accustomed to. We definitely were not happy with our performance defensively tonight. Hopefully we can be -- well, we know, not hopefully, we know we can be better in Game 3.",
        "2": "Well, I guess if you look in the sense of the size and the power and the speed that Shaq at his size played with, you could look at my game throughout the course of my career and say that.  And then you look at the elegance and the ability to shoot the ball and the ability to play in the paint as well as post up and get to the perimeter, I guess you can say that you can have some of AD's game that could compare to Kobe's game in that sense. Obviously, all four of us are all different positions.  Kobe was a natural 2-guard.  I'm kind of a, I don't know, whatever position.  Shaq is a center. AD is kind of a hybrid, as well.  But I guess all four of us, we have a winning mentality and we just tried to make enough plays out on the floor throughout the course of the game that would benefit not only ourselves individually but for the most important thing, for the better of the team. I can't even believe I'm up here talking about myself and AD with Kobe and Shaq.",
        "3": "Check his rÃ©sumÃ©.  It's that simple.  I mean, he's put in the work.  He's been there through everything that the Heat franchise has seen.  He's seen it all, done it all.  Just check his rÃ©sumÃ©.  There's not many guys that talk about it and also be about it, and he's one of them.  If you want to be in the foxhole, that's somebody you want to be in the foxhole with.",
        "4": "I think I was talking about force because Shaq's name came up.  There's no way that you can talk about Shaq and not have that word come up.  From the team's perspective, I think we've done a good job of, one, not turning the ball over, but also still being able to play with force, as you would say.  Play with tempo offensively, get good looks. Get good looks that we like and, make or miss, live with the results.  We have to play with that type of force defensively, but also from the cerebral side, as well.  Thinking the game a little bit better as they are going through their offense and their pace and their force, as well.  We've got to be a lot better obviously on that side.",
        "5": "For one, from a competitive standpoint, going against Frank's teams in Indiana when we had our battles and I was in Miami, you understood how well those teams were coached.  It starts with the head coach, and the players are an extension of the head coach. So I had that memory of that, just battling those Indiana Pacers teams.  And then for me, I've always been a coachable player throughout my whole life.  I've played for multiple coaches and I've always been a coachable player. So you know, the respect, more importantly, he's the head coach.  The head coach should have the respect from all his players, no matter who you are, if you're really serious about trying to make an impact or really trying to do something special.  It was just that simple for me personally. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "In what ways have you benefited from all these Finals appearances in terms of what it's meant to have the game's best coaches kind of expose any weaknesses and nitpick at your game?  What coaches that you've faced on this stage have had the biggest influence on your improvements?",
        "2": "Last night you were so excited to get back into the film and just go over what had happened in Game 1.  How late did you stay up watching last night, and then today have you guys gotten together at all to watch film?  And then also I was wondering what your biggest takeaways were from that review.",
        "3": "What's it like going up against a guy like Jae Crowder, who you had playoff battles when he was in Boston, then you were teammates, and now here you are going against one another again with the Finals on the line and having some physical moments in Game 1?",
        "4": "We talk about your leadership and how much you're able to help teach your teammates.  What does that look like during the regular season versus during the Finals?",
        "5": "Non-Finals question.  One of your rookie basketball cards bid for $1.8 million and another bid for $900,000.  Given your humble beginnings, what do you think of that when -- you're still playing, and it's not like you're Honus Wagner or Babe Ruth.  How do you take that in when somebody is paying $1.8 million for your rookie card?",
        "6": "A couple days ago you talked about what's happening in the world right now, controlling what you can control.  On the voting front, the Washington Post today had a story come out saying that the players have gone from I think 22 percent to 85 percent representation.  That's you guys controlling what you can control.  How much pride do you take in that, and do you feel like that message is landing and will make a mark?",

        "8": "To follow up on what you said about you and AD, do you feel like the ability to not be jealous of each other is sort of a natural quality or is that something that has to be learned for some guys, and what was that like for you kind of striking that balance?",
        "9": "Last night you said that you think it's easier to learn from wins than it is from losses.  I'm curious, though, how did the 2007 Finals shape the next 13 years of your career, going through that first trip and feeling that pain from that series?",
        "10": "When you went to the first Finals against Golden State, you lose Kyrie Irving in Game 1, you had already lost Kevin Love, then you went out and won the next couple games.  When a team is in Miami's situation now and they talk about next man up, next man up, how did you go from saying we can still do this to putting together a plan and then actually going out and doing it the next couple games?",

There's going to be five guys in opposing jerseys on the floor, and they're all dangerous, no matter who's in the lineup, no matter what the name is.  You have to approach it like they all can beat you as a unit, and as individuals they're on the floor for a reason.  We understand that.  We will have a game plan, no matter who's out on the floor.  But that's not for us to worry about.  For us to worry about is how we approach the game coming into Game 2 and how we continue to work our habits and try to be as great as we can be throughout 48 minutes.",
        "1": "Like I mentioned last night, the best teacher is life experience.  I've played against great coaches throughout my whole career, not only in the regular season but in the postseason, throughout first, second, third, Finals runs.  I've played against some exceptional coaches, great coaches, Hall of Fame coaches, Hall of Fame players.  They've all, opponents and coaches, helped me get to this point where I am today, to a point where I have no weakness, offensively or defensively, to where if I can read a defense, I can exploit it.  I can put myself in a position to be successful.  It doesn't mean that the ball goes in all the time, but there's nothing out on the floor that I cannot do at this point in my career.  That's all because of the competition and the adversity and the losses and everything I've been through throughout the course of my career.  At that point in time I say I've got to work on this because that's what they're allowing me to have; now I've got to work on this because they're shutting this down in my game.  It's just, like I said, the best teacher in life is life experience, and I've experienced it all.",
        "2": "I stayed up until about 4:00, 4:30 in the morning last night breaking down the film individually, watching the same things that we did throughout the course of the game, seeing ways we were great, seeing ways we were not so great, and a lot of them were things that we can control.  We're playing against an exceptional basketball team, obviously, great coached.  So we have to continue to understand that coming into Game 2.  It was great to get with the guys today earlier and go over the film, and like I said, see things that we can do a lot better, both offensively and defensively. They're going to make adjustments in Game 2, and we need to be ready for that.  We can't come out with the energy that we had in Game 1 and go down 23-10 and expect the same result as we had in Game 1.  So we look forward to that challenge.",
        "3": "It was like every other individual I went against in this playoff run.",
        "4": "I think for me, it's all about how you approach being a professional.  That's both on and off the floor, how you show up to work, how you walk, how you move, how you prepare.  It's not all about just talking about it.  It's how you be about it as well.  You don't get to pick two or three days out of the week where you want to be a leader or you say I want it to be Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  No, it's an everyday thing, both on the court and off the court. I try to lead by example.  I lead by my voice as well.  But I put the work in.  I think my guys see how much I put the work in, and they allow me to lead them.  I respect them for that.  I'm humbled by that as well.",
        "5": "I think it's pretty cool.  That's the first thing I think about when I think about where I come from, hearing those numbers -- you didn't hear those numbers much growing up, obviously, where I'm from.  And the second thing I think about is I have two rookie cards of my own, so I'll be good for a very, very long time.  No matter what happens, I'm good.",
        "6": "That is the hope.  That's the hope every day, that you can educate and you can get people motivated to go out and create change.  I've just tried to put not only myself but my team in position to be able to educate whoever needs it and to encourage and to empower people in our communities.  Like I say, we always talk about change in our communities: We want change, we want to see this, we want to see that.  We have the opportunity to do so. It's an honor for me to be in a position where I can have a platform and I can have a support system and I can have a group of people that we can put together a plan and then execute that and give it back.  It's also very humbling as well to hear that number, that percentage go from the low 20s to the 80s.  It's something that we want to continue to grow.  Hopefully we can be in the 90s by next week and even higher and in the higher 90s by November.  We want to continue that. Also had a lot of the volunteer poll workers in the virtual fan thing last night, 40 of them to be exact, and we have over 10,000 volunteers right now with More Than a Vote with the campaign that we're doing, initiative that we're doing.  Hopefully we can get 11,000 tomorrow and 12,000 and continue to grow that because it's so important.  We understand that, especially with COVID going around and not having the elderly out of their homes and doing those things, having the younger generation being able to come in and help out in such a difficult time right now with the virus that's going on still is very, very key.  Like I say, I'm proud of where we are, but we have a lot more room to go.  Hopefully we continue to do that.",
        "7": "We're not jealous of each other.  I think that's the best thing.  In professional sports, you have guys that join forces to become alpha males.  That's what they call them.  Two guys that have been dominant in a specific sport on their own respective teams, and they get together and they talk about how dominant they can be and they talk about this is going to be this and that. I believe jealousy creeps in a lot.  And that is the absolute contrary of what we are.  We know who we are.  We know what we're about.  We want the best, seriously, every single day, both on and off the floor, for one another.  We're just not jealous of one another.  I think that you align that with respect, I think the sky's the limit.",
        "8": "I don't speak for other guys and what they -- I don't know, I just speak for myself.  For AD, I know who we are.  We respect one another.  We drive one another.  We command excellence out of one another.  And that's what it boils down to. Jealousy and envy has killed a lot of great things, not only in sports but in general.  If you're able to just throw that to the side and throw your egos to the side but continue to bring that confidence of what you're trying to do of keeping the main thing the main thing -- not saying it's that easy, but for us it's that easy when it comes to our relationship.  Like I said, it doesn't result in wins every night.  It doesn't result in me putting up numbers or him putting up numbers every night, but as far as our brotherhood and our chemistry, that's what it boils down to.",
        "9": "Well, I mean, obviously they were the better team.  Dealing with Timmy and Manu and Tony and Pop, four Hall of Famers, I knew it would be challenging, not only for myself but for our franchise and for our ballclub.  I saw the way they approached every game, how they approached every possession.  They didn't make mistakes.  They weren't just happy with being there; they wanted to be great, as a unit and as individuals as well. I sensed that as a 22-year-old, and I saw that as a 22-year-old.  That helped shape me year after year after year after year, just holding on to that feeling of not being able to reach the ultimate goal.  But at the same time, like I said, just having that adversity and having those moments has put me in a position where I've been throughout my career.",
        "10": "I think every situation is different.  For us, obviously, losing Kyrie and losing Kevin in that playoff run was detrimental to our success.  We were still able to have some success, but we never fully reached the full potential of what our ballclub could be in that run. That's different from -- I can't correlate that to what today is all about.  For us as a ballclub and for us as the Lakers, our mindset is Game 1 is over and Game 2 we've got to be better than we were in Game 1.  And when we approach that with that mindset and be as desperate as the opponent, then we give ourselves a good chance to win.",
        "11": "Yeah, for us the game kind of dictates itself at times.  We have to win in different ways.  We're very good at the fast break game.  We understand that.  But when we make our mark on the defensive end, when we're getting deflections, we're getting blocked shots, we're contesting shots either at the rim or at the perimeter or mid-range, things of that nature, which creates early offense for us, it doesn't always show up in the box score, but when we're active defensively, we're an extremely good team. Every game is going to be its own challenge, and we understand that.  You have to win games in different fashions.  Sometimes even outside your own box.  But I think the great teams learn that throughout the course of a run, throughout the course of a season, and that's what puts them in a position to compete for a championship, which we are today.

        "0": "You guys went on a 75-30 run after falling down 13 early.  What allows you guys to have success like that over a sustained period of time, a run like that? Le",
        "1": "For AD, obviously his first Finals game.  What did you see about his preparation?  Was there any advice you gave him, and to see him perform like that, what do you feel about that? Le",
        "2": "You've felt the buzz of the NBA Finals nine times in your career, but what was it like today with nobody there, the sound?  I know you're used to bubble basketball at this point, but at this stage what did it feel like to play a Finals game? Le",
        "3": "You've seen plenty of times over the years where if one team has a bunch of injuries, the other team floats a little bit and doesn't come at them as hard.  How do you make sure that you guys don't do that in Game 2? Le",
        "4": "There was a few times where you guys got up big, and there was a lot of celebrating going on, and I see sometimes you had to rein it in a little bit.  In your experience, what have you seen in the past that got you to the point where you felt like sometimes you need to say, okay, let's keep it on task? Le",
        "5": "I'm wondering in a game like this when you had the kind of lead that you had, are you already thinking, \"This is what we could do better, here are some things that we're doing wrong.\" Were you already in that frame of mind during this game? Le",
        "6": "Teams have spent your whole career trying to keep you out of the paint, and you can say the same thing this season about AD.  What are some of the ways that you guys are still always seemingly able to get to the rim and still able to finish? Le",
        "7": "Why is Rondo so opposed to being called Playoff Rondo, and did you see some of that in the first half especially? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Paying attention to detail.  I don't think in the beginning that we were physical enough.  You have to get a feel for how hard Miami plays.  I think they smacked us in the mouth, and we got a sense of that.  And so we knew how hard we had to play if we wanted to try to make it a game. You know, from that moment when it was 23-10, we started to play to our capabilities.  We started flying around.  We started getting defensive stops.  We started sharing the ball a lot better offensively and just got into a really good groove.",
        "1": "I don't feel anything.  I expect it out of him.  Didn't need to give him no advice.  We've been preparing for this moment all season.  He's been preparing for this moment all season.  I'm happy to be on the same floor with him and in the same uniform.  He was, once again, a force in every facet of the game, offensively and defensively.",
        "2": "Felt great.  Felt great.  I've been preparing for this moment for quite a while.  Fans, no fans, the inner challenge for myself and the way I prepare myself, it felt amazing to be playing in the Finals once again.",
        "3": "We've got so much more work to do.  The job is not done.  We're not satisfied with winning one game.  It's that simple.",
        "4": "The best teacher in life is experience. I've experienced moments in my career where you have all the momentum in the world and you felt like you had the game under control, and one play here or one play there could change the course of a series or change the course of a game. One in particular that always rings home for me is Game 2 of the 2011 Finals in Miami versus Dallas.  D-Wade hits a three right by their bench.  I believe it put us up either 13 or 17.  From that moment on, Dallas went on a hell of a run and finished it off with a Dirk Nowitzki left-hand layup to steal that game.  That (expletive) burns me to this day. I always talk about the best teacher in life is experience, and I've experienced a lot.  That's what prompts me to be who I am today, is being able to have those experiences.",
        "5": "Yeah, absolutely.  I think you can learn so much more from a win than you can in a loss.  I can't wait for tomorrow for us to get back together and watch the film and see ways we can be better and see some of the breakdowns that we had, especially in that fourth quarter, especially in that first six minutes of the first quarter where we can be so much better defensively and also so much better offensively. So I can't wait.  I'm extremely amped up about watching the film with our ballclub tomorrow.  I'm going to watch some tonight obviously by myself, but I'm looking forward to getting together as a group tomorrow.",
        "6": "Because we have great spacing and great shooters.  KCP, Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris, a list of guys that can spread the floor, it allows myself and AD to be able to do the things that we do in the interior. We try to mix up our game, too.  We try to mix it in in the interior and the exterior.  But when you have guys that could space the floor like we have, it allows us to do some of the things that we do in the paint.",
        "7": "I'm not sure.  I've never called him that.  We've never called him that.  We only call him Do.  So that would be a Do question. But you know, just having him in this moment, having him on our side, and I think he mentioned yesterday or whenever Media Day was for the Finals, you just don't -- you never know.  You don't get these moments a lot.  It's been over a decade since he's been in the Finals.  I think he's just cherishing the moment, but also just playing the game that he loves to play -- the cerebral way, the determined way, the championship way, as he's been playing for quite a while now.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, just studying the Heat and what you've seen from them in this postseason, what's at the top of the list?  What stands out the most to you about the way that they're playing basketball? Le",
        "1": "You've described that time in Miami like it was going to college for you.  If you can think back to those four years, what were the most important lessons you learned about yourself and about leadership in general? Le",
        "2": "Would it have any extra meaning to you to win a championship against Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra, guys that have helped shape you and vice versa in those years together? Le",
        "3": "Six years after playing for Miami, how do you feel about Pat Riley? Le",
        "4": "Leaves it open for interpretation.  When you hear the name Pat Riley, what do you think about?  How do you describe your relationship -- Le",
        "5": "You've talked about just sort of the difficulty of adapting to the bubble. How much have you sort of motivated yourself by reflecting that your teammates are taking cues from you and trying to see how you approach things and sort of approach getting through this grind, the three months here? Le",
        "6": "Back in March the season comes to an end, two players on your team test positive for this virus.  When did you think getting to this point was even a possibility?  And what was it like kind of mourning the fact that maybe it wasn't happen? Le",
        "7": "From your vantage point, what do you think it is about Erik Spoelstra that, no matter if it's coaching No. 1 picks or a collection of undrafted/lower-drafted guys, allows him to continue to bring groups back here to the Finals, but also not necessarily always be in the conversation with that upper echelon of coaches? Le",
        "8": "There is political financial data out there that shows that pro sports owners, including NBA owners, donate overwhelmingly to Republican causes.  I know they've pledged a lot of money to help with racial and social justice issues, but do you feel that those political contributions undercut some of the efforts that players are making to gain progress on those topics? Le",
        "9": "You mentioned you're as determined as ever, right now as locked in as you've ever been.  Usually during this postseason run you block out from social media.  You couldn't do it this year because you're in a bubble, away from family.  Important election coming up.  How has that adjustment been for you during this time to have access to social media?  You usually try to eliminate distractions, but you've got it right there in your hand. Le",
        "10": "The last couple times you were here, you were pretty outmanned by a team with four great players.  As you come back now with the team you have around you, how do you feel going into this 10th Finals now?  Do you feel like talent-wise you don't have to worry about that problem this time? Le",
        "11": "It's been a long time, obviously, since you played for the Heat and a lot has happened to you and to the league since then.  All these years later, is there something that you still take away from your days in Miami?  The other one is, how are you different just from the last time that you were in the Finals, which was two years ago? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I would think two things:  One, how hard they play for 48 minutes, no matter if they're up, no matter if they're down.  They play extremely hard.  And I think two, it would be the way they move off the ball, they share the ball.  Everyone is live on the floor.  There's not one guy that you can disrespect or be off throughout the course of an offensive possession.  And they do a hell of a job of moving without the ball, sharing the ball, cutting, passing.  Those are two things that stand out.",
        "1": "I think as far as leadership, that grows no matter where you are every day, if you want to be a leader, if you strive to be a leader every day.  I think being around Riles and Spo, D-Wade and UD, just to name a few, being a part of that culture allowed me to grow, allowed me to see what it takes to not only compete for a championship but also to win a championship.  So it definitely put me in a position where I knew what it took.  I saw what it took.  But also I fit that culture as well because of how hard I worked.  It was a perfect match for those four years.",
        "2": "Absolutely not.  It's no extra meaning to winning a championship, no matter who you're playing against.  It's already hard enough to even reach the Finals, to be in this position.  If you're able to become victorious out of the Finals, it doesn't matter who it's against.  I'm just happy that I'm here with the opportunity to represent not only myself but represent our fans, our fan base, our organization, my teammates, our coaching staff, our training staff and so many others that represent this organization to the utmost respect.",
        "3": "That's such a broad question.  I don't understand.",
        "4": "When I hear Pat Riley, I think about one of the greatest minds probably this game has ever had.  He's won at every level.  I saw the stat the other day that he's been part of a championship in four decades.  This league is not the same without Riles.  He's a great guy, great motivator, someone that just knows what it takes to win, and he's shown that over the course of, what, 40 years.",
        "5": "It's probably been the most challenging thing I've ever done as far as a professional, as far as committing to something and actually making it through.  But I knew when I was coming what we were coming here for.  I would be lying if I sat up here and knew that everything inside the bubble, the toll that it would take on your mind and your body and everything else, because it's been extremely tough. But I'm here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to compete for a championship.  That was my mindset once I entered the bubble, once I entered the quarantine process the first two days.  Then right from my first practice, my mindset was to -- if I'm going to be here, make the most of it and see what you can do and lock in on what the main thing is.  The main thing was for us to finish the season and compete for a championship. So that's just been my mindset throughout these -- I don't even know how many days it is.  However many days it is, it feels like five years.  So it really doesn't matter.  I've been as locked in as I've ever been in my career.",
        "6": "I didn't know that this was a possibility until we actually got on the plane in L.A. to fly here to Orlando.  We had seen some other teams arrive before us.  We got here July 9th.  We had seen some of the teams arrive a couple days before us.  But until we landed here, actually got off the plane, got on the bus and pulled up here to the hotel, that's when it became a reality to me.",
        "7": "Well, that's a question for you guys.  The players and the coaches know how great Spo is.  There's this narrative that Spo is not great, and the narrative that he doesn't get a lot of respect, which he should.  He prepares his team every single night.  If you watch the Miami Heat, no matter who's on the floor, they're going to play Heat culture. They're going to play hard. They're going to play together.  That's what he's always been about.  It's been you guys that have changed the narrative or has never given Spo his respect because he had D-Wade or he had myself or he had Bosh.  But a lot of coaches have talent.  A lot of coaches have had talent over the course of this league.  It's not one. It's unfortunate that he hasn't gotten his respect.  Every time we talked about Spo when I was there and we talked about how great he prepared us, and we talked about how great it was playing for Spo and things of that nature, you guys always said, Well, you have LeBron, you have D-Wade, you have Bosh; any coach can do it.  No, any coach can't do it.  If any coach could do it, then there would be a lot more champions in this league.  There would be a lot more successful coaches. Spo likes it.  That's what fuels Spo, is the disrespect that you guys give him, the basketball world.  I'm not going to sit up here and act like I don't know what Spo is all about, because he's damned good, if not great.  Probably is great, because his preparation.  He prepares like it's his last time ever coaching again every game, and I know that.  That's why I feel good.",
        "8": "Well, one, I'm not going to give my energy to that because it's not surprising.  My mom has always told me, control what you can control, and I can't control that.  What I can control is what I'm doing on my side and trying to have people gather around me and gather around my initiatives and doing what we're doing to try to effect change, not only in our communities but outside of our communities with the youth, and let them understand how important their voice is and their vote is to our society.  It's hard as hell, because they just don't believe it.  They don't believe that their vote or their message or their minds or their voices matter.  But that's where my energy is, on continuing to push the envelope in my community, continue to let them know that they are the future, they are the reason why there will be change.  But I can't give my energy to the other side because that will take away from my people, and I can't do that. Control what you can control.  I can't control that. That is what it is.  It's not a surprise.  But I've got work to do on the other side.  So that's what my mission is about.",
        "9": "Yeah, I think in this particular case, everything about this year is different.  Everything about 2020 is different, and to make the most of it, you have to be able to adjust.  I've adjusted in the sense of understanding that there's also a bigger opportunity coming up as well in November, while I'm still keeping the main thing the main thing and the focus on leaving a legacy here and playing the game that I love to play and competing for a championship.  But also letting my people know that I'm not jaded, and I'm not too distracted where I cannot continue to give the resources, put the people in place to help them go to the places where they don't believe they can even go.  Sometimes you do things that even you personally don't even believe that you can do, but when you have a support system, and you have a group around you that's just as motivated as you, you're able to tackle a few things at once.",
        "10": "I never had a problem with any team I went to the Finals [with].  I've always been confident that we had the ability to win.  If you're going to a Finals saying you're undermanned or you feel like you don't have enough, then who are you?  The game is won between the four lines, not won on paper.  At the end of the day, when I've lost in the Finals, the better team won because they played well, they were more prepared and they did what they needed to do to win those four games.  When I've won, the same thing. I'm not here to talk about the talent we all have, the team that we have.  The game is won in between the four lines, 94 feet.  The team that is prepared and the team that executes, the team that is not careless throughout 48 minutes will give themselves a chance to win each and every game.  I'm confident going into this Finals, as I've always been in my career.",
        "11": "I think every part of anybody's individual life where they were able to grow, it never leaves you.  That's no different for me having my four years in Miami, being around -- with that culture, growing.  You guys don't realize, I talk about it, I went to Miami when I was 25 years old.  I was 25.  I was 25 to 29, so I was still growing.  I was still a kid and still trying to figure out who I am as a person and as a man, growing while still trying to compete for a championship every single year. I grew, and they allowed me to grow.  We pushed each other every single day, and like I said, I fit perfectly in that culture because I worked just as hard as anybody else.  I show up to work and I don't leave until I feel like I was as great as I was.  Do you always become successful at it?  Are you always going to win?  No, it doesn't happen like that.  But you're able to sleep a little bit better at night when you know you've punched the clock. And how am I different today than two years ago when I entered the Finals?  I've got a little bit more gray hair in my beard. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "Frank said he felt like you played with a chip on your shoulder all year.  What does it mean to this have moment after everything you went through with your first year with the Lakers and after every single obstacle you kept hitting this season and yet you still end up where you were trying to get? Le",
        "2": "You mentioned getting the Lakers back to the Finals.  Last time they got there, Game 6 Western Conference Finals, 2010, Kobe goes for 37, hits all those dagger jumpers in the fourth.  How do you process your emotions all year about Kobe, and as this run has continued, wearing the purple and gold, how that's all sat in your mind? Le",
        "3": "Do you find yourself savoring these moments more than when you were younger? Le",
        "4": "The nature of your accomplishments has had you compared to the greats of the game for a long time, but you've insisted, \"I'm my own guy and it's my own story.\"  What about the fact that you didn't just stay on the first team you played with, first city; you go to Miami, you go to L.A.  What has that meant to you to blaze your own trail as a superstar or whatever? Le",
        "5": "The Finals have been basically the LeBron James Invitational for the last decade.  What were you doing at this time last year and how did that affect your continued determination to get back here? Le",

        "7": "In the fourth quarter, where is your head at in terms of deciding this thing is not going to a Game 6? Le",
        "8": "LeBron, you said that you thought about AD and wanting to show him something that he has never seen before.  What has he meant to you this season?  Obviously, you guys are very close, but to go through this year with him, how have you needed him? Le",

        "12": "In the postgame ceremony, you said how tough it is to get to the Finals.  You've now done it nine times over the last 10 years.  How have you been able to have that type of longevity, and how did this ceremony feel this year without fans? Le"

        "0": "Yeah, just, one, getting my breath back underneath me after a hard-fought series against one of most well-coached team I've ever played against in the postseason, one of the most respected teams I've played against. Obviously, you guys know how much I love Mike Malone.  He's incredible.  He's the reason why that team is so damn good.  So I was thinking about that. I was also thinking about some of my teammates who this is their first appearance to the Finals.  Obviously, AD had a lot on my thought process.  This is the reason why I wanted to be a teammate of his and why I brought him here.  I wanted him to see things that he had not seen before in this league.  To be able to come through for him meant a lot for me personally. Then I started thinking about the next opponent. Boston had a few moments in my head.  Miami had a few moments in my head as well.  How challenging that's going to be, whoever wins that series. Then I just started thinking about my journey as well.  All that was just going through my mind as the confetti was on the floor, was coming down, landing on my shoulder and things of that nature.  So hopefully that was a good description.",
        "1": "For me personally, the job is not done.  But it's great to hit moments throughout the course of a journey and appreciate that.  This is all part of the process, but the job is not done for me personally. For us as a franchise, I'm extremely proud to be a part of this franchise getting back to where it belongs, and that's playing for championships and competing for championships and representing the Western Conference in the championships. This is what I came here for. I heard all the conversations and everything that was said about why did I decide to come to L.A -- the reason I came to L.A., it was not about basketball.  All those conversations, just naysayers and things of that nature.  I understood that, with the season I had last year and my injury, it just gave them more sticks and more wood to throw in the fire to continue to say the things that they would say about me.  But it never stopped my journey and never stopped my mindset and never stopped by goa. I'm happy, like I said, and proud of this organization and proud of my teammates and I'm proud of the coaching staff, the front office and our ownership as well at this very moment today.",
        "2": "I mean, every time you put on purple and gold, you think about his legacy.  You think about him and about what he meant to this franchise for 20-plus years, and what he stood for both on the floor and off the floor.  What he demanded out of his teammates and what he demanded out of himself. We have some similarities in that sense. Our games are different, but as far as our mindset and our drive to want to be the best and our drive to not lose -- sometimes you're going to lose games, but that drive to always want to be victorious, it stops you from sleeping.  And sometimes you put certain things -- you sacrifice a lot of things.  You sacrifice your family at times because you're so driven to be so great that other things fall by the wayside at times. So I understand that.  I'm one of the few that can understand the mindset that he played with and the journey from high school to the NBA. It's just a thing that I carry with me, like I said, every time I decide at one point in that locker room before the game when I throw that jersey on.",
        "3": "I don't, unfortunately.  I wish I did.  They happen so fast and my mind is still so locked in on the journey that it's hard for me to take in and appreciate what we just accomplished. Just how I've always been. I always say that when I'm done playing the game, hopefully I look back on it and enjoy it -- and hopefully I will.  Hopefully I can, because I don't think I enjoy it enough when I'm in it because I'm so engulfed in the process until the final call. But I'm so damn proud of this team and where we are right now up until this day.",
        "4": "I don't know, I've never looked at it that way.  I've never said, OK, I want to cast myself as a superstar or whatever the case may be.  I just want to travel my own journey, because it is my journey. I've appreciated everything that's happened along the way.  I mean, throughout -- the ups, the downs, the ups on the court, the downs on the court, the wins and losses. But I've been able to, I guess as Frank Sinatra would say, I did it my way.  At the end of the day and at the end of my career, I just hope that I inspire enough people to want to play the game the right way, and have that respect from all the opponents that I played against, all the teams that I played against and the organizations that I play for.  Because at the end of the day, I mean, that's all you have, is your respect.",
        "5": "Well, it all depends what game you were talking about.  There were a couple games where I was at home.  There was one or two games where I was in Cabo and a couple games where I was at a hookah lounge during the Finals last year.  That's the truth.  I wasn't smoking hookah, but I was there.",
        "6": "Absolutely.  I wouldn't have went.  The game was on in Cabo, the game was on in my house and at the hookah lounge.  I watched every single minute of the games until they stopped.  I actually watched every single postseason game last year.  I think I told David that; I watched every single postseason game. Part of me, I'm just a fan of the game.  I love the sport.  I love the competitive nature.  I love the playoffs. And then, also, of saying like, oh, I wish I was in this moment, what would I have done at that moment? What play would I have made in that moment if I was out there? So yes, I didn't miss a game.  I didn't miss one game.  Even on vacation, I didn't miss a game.  My wife didn't like it, but she'll be OK (smiling).",
        "7": "I've always had the mindset that in a close-out game for me personally, I'm just as desperate as the team that we are trying to close out.  I don't want to play another game.  And if we are in a position where we can win that game, that's just my mindset. Does it always go that route?  No, because I don't believe I'm undefeated.  I'm not undefeated in close-out games.  My mindset is that I do not -- if we have played well enough and we are in the fourth quarter and we have a chance to win, I do not want to play another game.  I mean, I love the game, but I do not want to play another game.  That's always been my mindset.  I want to be just as desperate as my opponent, just as desperate as the other team, the player that I'm lined up against, the coaching staff that's on the other side.  It's just who I am.  It's just a mindset I'm able to link into at that very moment.",
        "8": "I guess it was a very, very, very, very long time ago, when I was 27, like a long-ass time ago when I was 27 in this league.  I just wanted to put myself kind of in his position.  Sometimes what I would be thinking at that age and if I was with someone in the later stage of their career, I just don't want to let them down.  And I'm not even talking on the floor, because there's things that sometimes they go in, they don't go in. But as far as, I don't want to say a role model, but someone that holds myself to a higher standard as far as character.  I don't want to let them down.  And then, it's funny because it's kind of rubbed off on me as well because he doesn't want to let me down. I don't know, you've seen the movie Step Brothers before, right?  Well, there it is.",
        "9": "Yeah, I'm Will Ferrell, for sure.  I get on his nerves a lot, for sure.  I go in and mess with his drums and he's not watching -- yeah, that's me.  I get on his nerves a lot.",
        "10": "I think Alex Caruso is a true definition of when opportunity meets preparation.  He's been preparing for this moment for a long time and he just needed opportunity. Luke [Walton] gave him an opportunity last year, and now Coach Vogel and our coaching staff are giving him an opportunity on a bigger stage.  He's just taking full advantage of that and just full stride.  He's just gotten better and better every single minute he's on the floor. He's still learning.  Every game is still a learning experience for him because he's so new to the NBA.  He played a lot of his minutes over the course of his early stages in the G League. But first time I saw him, and seeing him in some of our practices, it wasn't the sneaky athleticism.  It was the way that he defended and how cerebral he played the game. I gravitate toward players like that right away, because the game, everybody talks about the physical side and how high you can jump and how fast you can run and all those things.  But the mental side is what gets you to the next level.  You know, I saw that from A.C. and he continues to learn.  He's just been great for us.",
        "11": "He's been great.  He's been unbelievable.  I mean, we've faced, it's been a crazy obstacle course for our franchise this whole year.  I'm not going to sit here and give all the details, but you guys, everyone can go back and just see from the start of the season all the way up until now what we've gone through as a team.  He's been able to manage it the whole time.  Bringing in guys, losing guys.  He's just always been the anchor, and our coaching staff has been right behind him.  I can't say anything more than that. Just happy to be on the floor to kind of be his coach on the floor and just command to my teammates the same message that he's given to me and be an extension of his mind.  It's been great.",
        "12": "One, I've taken care of my body.  I've been available to my teammates.  That's one.  I sleep.  I try to get as much sleep as I can.  I think there's no better recovery than sleep.  And then I've never cheated the game as well.  I've put so much work into my craft, so much work into the game.  I think you add on to the fact that I've played with some great teammates and some great coaching staffs, from T-Lue and his coaching staff to Erik Spoelstra and his coaching staff, and now this coaching staff with Frank Vogel. I'm blessed.  I'm truly blessed.  They have all allowed me to be me.  They have allowed me to go out and do the things that I do on the floor.  Use my mind, my play and be able to command my teammates the way I do.  It's put me in position to be able to, like you said, be in the Finals nine out of 10 years. To answer your second question, everything is different.  It's 2020.  Nothing feels the same.  Everything is different.  So the ceremony is different.  The one thing I can say, I wish we were in Staples Center tonight with our fans, with our Laker faithful, because they deserve this as much as we do because they went through the last so many years of not being in a postseason run, feeling like their franchise would never get back to this moment.  But they continued to stay faithful.  It would have been great to celebrate with them tonight. So hopefully we can continue to give them something to smile about in the next round, as well. That's what our mindset is. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "I knew it was winning time, and Jamal had it going.  The kid is special.  He has an array of shots.  Triple threat from the three, mid-range and also in the paint. For me, it's just trusting my defensive keys.  Trusting my study of film.  Trusting personnel.  And living with the results.  I told my teammate that I had him and everyone else can kind of stay at bay and stay home.  I was able to get a couple stops and we were able to rebound the basketball, which is the most important thing.",
        "1": "I think at times we're doing a great job.  At certain times, we can do a better job with our spacing, especially on our post-ups.  They are doing a little doubling on the post at times, so we've got to get a better outlet for AD when he is posting up and get the ball swung-swung as quickly as possible to get more looks.  I thought we did a really good job, more importantly, tonight of not turning the ball over.  The thing we talked about in Game 2 and Game 3 is we cannot turn the ball over against this team.  We did a great job of that tonight.",
        "2": "Not for me.  I don't reserve any energy.  I'm on the floor, I give it all I got.  If I need a break, I ask for a break.  Coach has done a good job of getting me out throughout the course of the game.  I don't look at it as a reserve tank.  I've got pretty good energy when I'm on the floor all the time.  It's winning time and I don't have a chance or time to be feeling tired.  I'm tired now.  That's when I'm tired, when it's zeros on the clock.  That's when I'm tired.  I'm not tired during the game.",
        "3": "It's just about playing to our capability.  Coming out with the game plan and executing it for 48 minutes.  If we do that, we give ourselves a good chance to win.",
        "4": "Dwight was a beast.  Gave us opportunities when we missed shots, which as a team, we missed a couple.  AD didn't miss any, but as a team, when we missed a couple shots, he was cleaning glass both offensively and defensively.  Got us put-backs and was able to control the paint.  We know we got smashed in the rebounding category in Game 3, so we wanted to do a better job in that. Dwight brought that physical presence.  It was great for our ballclub. Tonight, late game, Do [Rajon Rondo] was running pick-and-rolls.  I was able to run a couple.  But we just made our free throws.  We made our free throws down the stretch, and that's what closes games out.  You've got to get your stops defensively, make your free throws when you're fouled. And I thought we did that.",
        "5": "See how low his brow is.  If his brow is really low, then you know not to talk to him.  If it's higher, then he's accepted the fact that you're allowed to come into his office and talk to him. Yesterday his brow was very low in this part and no one talked to him.  So we already knew the mindset he was in, and he came out and did it.",
        "6": "I think at the end of the day, respect.  You just look at the history of America and the disrespect that Black women have gotten for the last 400 years.  You can't turn a blind eye to that. When I look at my household and see my daughter, who is five on her way to six, my wife and my mom, rest in peace my grandmother, so many Black women have done so many things for me.  Seeing the sacrifices they made, especially my mom when I was growing up.  They were disrespected along the way and it's still like that today. In the case of Breonna Taylor's case, it's just shown once again that the walls of the neighbor is more important than her life. So not only did I want to acknowledge all the queens in this world, all the Black queens in this world, but the ones in my life, the personal ones, too.  I just kind of had a moment yesterday.  I mean, I have a lot of moments, but felt like it was important to let Black women know that you're not alone.  No matter the disrespect or what they may feel, don't stop.  Because that's exactly what they want you guys to do.  They want you guys to stop.  They want you guys not to be as powerful as you guys are, not as strong as you guys are, as determined as you guys are.  They want you all to be at bay.  They want you to accept what's going on.  For sure, I won't allow that. When they are feeling down or feeling like there's no journey for them or gateway to be heard or to be seen or be respected or be accepted, my job is to continue to let them know that they are.  They are important to everything that goes on, not only in America but in the world. Everything that goes on for 24 hours in day, 365 days a year, 366 in a leap year.  That's what it's about.",
        "7": "We didn't talk about that.  One thing, we wanted to be there for our brother, Do.  As much as it's devastating to us, you can only imagine it happening in your backyard. Do being from Louisville,  we knew how tough it had to be on his family and the locals there. No, we didn't discuss that one bit.  But can't say that we were surprised at the verdict.  None of us are surprised at it.  That's what's more devastating, that none of us were surprised at what the outcome was.",
        "8": "Do has been in a lot of playoff games.  He's won a championship.  He's played at the highest level, and he's someone that we can trust. In the postseason, every possession is so important. When you can have guys that have been in the moments and can understand and also be able to make adjustments on the fly, and know that you can count on them down the stretch, it just makes the team and you individually feel so much more confident in the outcome. Do has been, ever since he got back from injury and we saw this playoff run, he's been exceptional.",
        "9": "Thank you.  Reminded me.",
        "10": "I think the best thing is that we have been together.  We're able to see what's going on and be able to bounce things off one another and to be there for one another. This game is so much bigger than just us getting on the floor and running around and calling out screens and running plays and making mistakes and trying to figure out how we can be better the next time.  There's also a big thing called life that's involved in this, too.  And to have, like you said, things that happened in Kenosha, and the Breonna Taylor case and so many other things that are going on in America, as we speak and as we move forward, being around people that you can trust and confide in, be able to talk to, bounce things off and not feel that you have to tackle it by yourself, I think that's very important when you have a support system like that. The best thing that you can have is a close-knit group, because we're together more than we are with our families.  So having that support is pretty amazing. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "2": "The success you guys had in the fourth quarter, some due to zone defense, some due to activity, was it just a matter of upping intensity level or giving a different look that Denver wasn't anticipating?  How do you account for the run you went on? Le",
        "3": "I wanted to ask you something off the court.  You've spent so much time in the bubble talking about police brutality and the relationship of police in the black community and on Tuesday you expressed your condolences towards the officers in Compton who were shot and talked about the need for non-violence.  There's this sort of narrative in this framing that emerges from some people that frames your position in talking about police brutality as something that incites violence against officers, and the L.A. County Sheriff obviously had that kind of implication last week when he asked you to contribute to the reward.  I'm wondering what your reaction is when you hear those two things connected, and did you think it was appropriate for the sheriff to sort of bring that up and bring you into that discussion? Le",
        "4": "Do you want to talk about the game again?  The turnovers you had, the turnover issues, is there a common denominator with where those are coming?  Is it something Denver is doing defensively? Le",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think it was the same in Game 2, same thing that we were able to get by with AD's shot, turned the ball over too much.  We couldn't get to the free throw line, and you know, I give credit where credit is due, though. Denver came in and played exceptionally well.  They played better than us, more aggressive than us through three quarters, 36 minutes, but you know, we've got into the penalty in the third quarter with like nine and a half minutes to go and we had some turnovers that led to some easy buckets for them.  We had 16 turnovers for 25 points and put them to the line 29 times.  It's not going to be winning ingredients for us if we continue to do that and we knew that, even after Game 2, we talked about that, trying to assure that.  Got to be better than that Game 4.",
        "1": "I think offensively we were very good.  At times, we weren't.  I think we just got to do a better job, like Coach was saying, of getting to the paint and once the defense collapses, just finding our guys weak side; if it's a guy that's slashing, through a weak side to the paint or if it's a guy that's spotted up on our side off one of our bigs, getting behind the defense for a lob. So Denver has been a pretty good defensive team all year.  We understand that.  I'm looking forward to seeing our film -- our film session tomorrow and continue to get better.",
        "2": "I think it's a bit of both.  I think we played with a lot more energy, and we understand we had 12 minutes left to try to make a game out of it and we were able to do that.  We were able to switch some things up defensively, going zone here, man here, trying to keep them off balance. When you dig yourself a hole like that, every shot that they make and every shot that we miss, feels like the game is collapsing.  So you know, we played some pretty good ball in the fourth quarter, but those first 36 minutes, that hurt us obviously.",
        "3": "I've never in my 35 years ever condoned violence.  Never have.  But I also know what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong and I grew up in an inner city in a black community, in what we call the \"hood,\" the \"ghetto,\" however you want to picture it.  And I've seen a lot of counts, firsthand, of a lot of black people being, you know, I guess racially profiled because of our color, and I've seen it, you know, throughout my whole life.  You know, and I'm not saying that all cops are bad, because I actually throughout high school and things of that nature, I'm around them all the time and they are not all bad. But when you see the videos that's going on and you can see not only my hometown but all over America, you continue to see the acts of violence towards my kind, I can't do nothing but to speak about it and see the common denominator. But not one time have I ever said, you know, let's act violent towards cops.  I just said that what's going on in our community is not okay, and we fear for that and we fear for our lives.  It's something that we go on every single day as a black man and a black woman and a black kid and a black girl, we fear; we fear that moment where we are pulled over or -- I just seen something, I believe yesterday or the day before, of a guy in Wisconsin was renting a house, and the next door neighbor called the police on him, and the police came in the house without a warrant, without anything, and arrested the guy, a black man because he was sitting out on the porch, and if you can't tell me that's not racial profiling, then I don't know what the hell -- or what the hell we are looking at. But I do not condone violence towards anyone, police, black people, white people, anyone of color, anyone not of color, because that's not going to ever make this world or America what we want it to be. So -- and I have zero comment on the sheriff.",
        "4": "It's some of the risk passes that we're making, including myself.  I mean, I had five turnovers in the first half and one in the second half, so I understood what I was doing in the first half and made an adjustment.  There are some passes that we have been able to complete throughout this season, but versus Denver we have to be a little bit more careful and make more -- more sound plays with the ball, and protect the ball, because like we always preach, every possession is very important.  When you give up 25 points off 16 turnovers, that's not good.  We did the same thing in Game 2, we had 24 turnovers and luckily it didn't bite us in the butt but it should have. We just got to do a better job of that and it's a conscious effort that not only starts with me because I'm the point guard of the team, and it trickles down to everyone else.",
        "5": "I was just setting a screen and his elbow got high and was able to strike me -- strike me across the jaw.  I don't -- I don't care about flagrant ones or flagrant twos.  I don't want him to come out of the game.  I like the competition.  I don't think it was blatant but I don't know mindset, but I don't think he did it on purpose.  I was okay with it.  You know, went down for a little bit.  Got back up and was ready to play.  I was cool with the ruling.  I was okay with them saying a flagrant one.  I ain't here to fight.

We played Brooklyn at home and he had a similar shot right on that left wing in front of their bench to win the game and he missed it.  He was down on himself, but at the end of the day, I told him, if you're open, and I was able to drive that particular game and find him wide open and he just missed it. But it's just the confidence to take the shot.  You're not going to make them all, but the belief to just take it and live with the results is what it's all about.  Tonight was his moment.  Tonight was his moment to find a space, hunt the ball down and one of our top 10 assists leaders, Rondo, found him and he knocked it down.  A big-time play.",
        "4": "No, it's not about an individual matchup.  It's about us trying to execute and him just coming through for us. That's what he did.  It wasn't, okay, your turn, my turn.  It's about playing the game and trying to find ways to make an impact. Obviously, those two big shots that he had at the end, one was the floater to take the lead.  Joker was able to get the tip-in, and he comes back in with the three.  Just big-time plays, like I said, for a big-time player.",
        "5": "I don't know.  That's actually an AD question.  Just happy to have him.  I know what he brought to the table.  I know what he's about.  I know his skill set.  That's why I wanted him here so badly.",
        "6": "That's what this floor right here that we're all on right now is all about.  It's the practices; it's the shootarounds.  We talk about every single scenario possible:  up three; down three; up two; down two; do we have a foul to give, do we not; do we have a timeout, do we not; are we going full-court; half-court; BOB, which is baseline out-of-bounds; SOB, sideline out-of-bounds.  You talk about all those things.  You want to be a championship club, you have to be able to do that on the fly. So knowing we didn't have a timeout, we were able to get into a situation to a set that we worked on in practice and get right to it. The first option, for me if Do [Rondo] saw me over the top, and if not, AD flashes. And the rest is history.",
        "7": "When you are trying to play high-level basketball, you have to have high-level IQ players, and he's one of them.  And not only does he have high-level IQ, but he also plays with high energy.  We know what we're going to get out of him every night. It's not about him making shots.  We know he's going to defend and he's going to play at a level that he's capable of playing at, and we all know that once he checks into the game every single night.  We know what to expect out of him.  To be honest, when he makes shots, it's extra credit for us.  But he puts that work in on his offensive skill set to get better and better.   We love everything about him.",
        "8": "For sure.  I know we're here playing the game, but I'm not losing the fact of what's important, as well.  More than a vote, it's about protecting black voters and voter suppression that goes on in our communities. Like you said, change isn't made by sitting on the sidelines.  That's one of our slogans and we're very proud of that.  Getting the people that want to join us, getting them gear and wearing the T-shirt and wearing the hats and wearing the hoodies, because when they go in their community, that's something that they can continue to enlighten, continue to educate, continue to make people empowered about this movement. We always talk about change in our communities, and now we have an opportunity.  We have an opportunity to really create change for the better and we look forward to this opportunity.",
        "9": "To be completely honest, man, it was probably one of the greatest moments of my career up until that point.  Just knowing the situation, we were about to go down 0-2 and we had home-court advantage.  We knew how powerful that Orlando team was, playing against actually my teammate now in Dwight.  So for me to be able to hit that shot was a huge moment for me.  I was still a young kid at the time, so big-time. The one thing I wish AD had tonight with the shot that he made, I wish we were playing at Staples.  We miss our fans so much and I can imagine in -- I probably would have blue the roof off Staples Center, AD hitting that shot with our crowd.  I would have loved to have that moment -- I know what it felt like for me when I was able to hit that shot that you mentioned against Orlando, Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals at the buzzer.",
        "10": "I think just staying even-keeled.  That's what it's all about.  The playoffs and the postseason, the more you advance into the postseason, the emotions and the adversity, it's going to be a roller coaster at times.  No matter if you're up, no matter if you're down, being able to keep your composure and your mindset on the main thing is very important.  This is the furthest he's gone in his career up to this point, and. I'm just happy to be here with him to give him any advice and lean on me.  To be completely honest, in the second half, I leaned on him, and he brought us home.  So I just tried to set the example early on, and we leaned on him, especially in the fourth quarter, and he brought us home.",
        "11": "I don't know.  I think for me, it's always been about the man in the arena, the quote from Theodore Roosevelt.  It's about the guy that's in the arena that's gone through everything -- the blood, the sweat, the tears and, in our situation, the competition. I's about the work that you put in and the belief in yourself.  It's not about the doubters or the naysayers or the people who are going to try to talk to you and slander you and bring you down every single day.  It's not about them because they have never been in the arena.  They don't understand. AD, he knows how special he is and when he doesn't, I'll be the first one to tell him how special he is.  He wanted to be here.  I'm happy he wanted to be here, because if he didn't, we wouldn't have a moment like tonight.  That's what it's all about. You put that pressure on yourself when you don't really care what other people think, because what other people think doesn't really matter because they don't understand.  Anybody can talk from outside, but if they got into the ring or they got into the arena, probably 10 times out of 10, they [expletive] their pants. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "With you and AD and then in the lineup when Dwight joined you in the frontline, what are ways you can impose your physicality, athleticism, size, how can this play out in this series?",
        "1": "You've talked about using Game 1 as a feel-out game.  Was there anything even after the first quarter that you guys identified when things seemed to switch for you defensively starting in the second quarter?",
        "2": "We spoke about the MVP award with you in March and you said it's not something that's ever motivated you and your true motivation is to be considered the best ever, but when you see the results come out today, knowing you've won it four times but now you've come in second four times, what's that feeling like for you, and what did you think of the results?",
        "3": "Did you surprise yourself by the reaction you had when you saw those results?  Did you know that -- I'm just wondering if you knew that you would have this strong of a reaction to seeing those numbers.",
        "4": "Do you feel like the MVP criteria is something that rewards the Most Valuable Player in the league?",
        "5": "In the past when you've had, call them slight or whatever, when you've finished second in the past, did it bother you as much?  And the next question would be, how much of your strong reaction do you think has to do with the fact that you've done what you've done in year 17 at 35 with a new team?  Does that factor into your kind of emotion here?",
        "6": "Given all this team has been through and all you've had to lead them through, how would you compare this to years you've won MVP?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We just tried to follow the game plan.  Try not to foul and put teams on the free throw line because those are easy points and we just trust our game plan.  We trust our, what we've been doing all throughout the course of this whole year.  We have a lot of length out there with myself, AD, Dwight, KCP and Danny at the start of that third quarter, and we were able to get some deflections, get some turnovers and get out and do what we do best on the break. You know, just having that type of size and that athleticism helps tremendously.",
        "1": "Well, yeah, we knew the first quarter definitely wasn't Laker basketball, Laker defense.  We just had some break downs.  We had some break downs, took a quarter for us to kind of figure it out.  Not saying that we fully figured them out because it's too early in the series to say that but started to get a better feel and rhythm defensively and started to get some stops in the second quarter and build that lead up going into halftime.",
        "2": "Pissed me off.  That's my true answer.  It pissed me off because out of 101 votes, I got 16 first-place votes.  That's what pissed me off more than anything.  You know, not saying that the winner wasn't deserving of the MVP. But that pissed me off.  And I finished second a lot in my career, either from a championship, and now four times as an MVP.  You know, like I said, I never came into this league to be MVP or to be a champion.  I've always just wanted to get better and better every single day, and those things will take care of itself.  But some things is just out of my hand and some things you can't control. But it pissed me off.",
        "3": "No.",
        "4": "I don't know.  I'm not going to sit up here and talk about what the criteria should be or what it is. It's changed over the years since I've gotten into the league, I know that.  You know, it's just changed.  It's changed a lot.  You know, sometimes it's the best player on the best team.  Sometimes it's the guy with the best season statistically.  Sometimes -- it's changed over the course -- over the course of my career.  I mean, you don't know.  You don't know. But you know, Giannis had a hell of a season, I can definitely say that.",
        "5": "I mean, I'm fine.  Don't get it twisted.  I'm going back to my room.  I'm perfectly fine.  We're 1-0 in the Western Conference Finals.  I'm absolutely fine.  So don't -- like I was pissed off at the reaction earlier when I saw it.  I'm absolutely great now.  I'm going back to my room, drink some wine and sleep very well tonight.  Let's not get it twisted.  I'm great. It's just the voting scale is a little weird to me sometimes.  I mean, it you take 2012.  If you just stick with me -- or 2012-13, I had a chance to be Defensive Player of the Year and also MVP in the same season.  And that year [Marc] Gasol was [voted] Defensive Player of the Year, but he made Second Team All-Defense, okay. So that doesn't make sense.  It's like being MVP of the league but you make Second Team All-NBA.  That's when I really started to look at things kind of like differently.  I was like, how does that even make any sense.  It's like being Rookie of the Year but you make Second Team All-Rookie. And then I looked at the Most Improved this year, and rightfully so Brandon Ingram was amazing and I thought he should have won it.  But did you see the vote that Devonte' Graham got?  He averaged four points last year compared to 17 and a half.  If that's not improving, what is? And it's a weird thing sometimes that you just have -- I don't know how much we are really watching the game of basketball or are we just in the narration mode, the narrative.",
        "6": "I don't even remember.  I don't remember, actually.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I don't remember to be completely honest.  It would be hard for me to answer that question. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "You guys have played six games in the last 20 days, in part because of winning 4-1 both times.  How does that feel physically in terms of basketball rhythm, rest? Le",
        "2": "You know what it's like to come back from a 3-1 deficit, how difficult that is.  The Nuggets have done it twice.  What does that say about them as a team and competitors?  And the second question, is your thumb OK? Le",
        "3": "Michael Malone, you go way back.  Always shown him love when you've been playing against him.  What allowed you guys to create that connection, that respect and bond back when you were in Cleveland together? Le",
        "4": "A lot of young guys on this Denver team, but there's at least one familiar face in Paul Millsap, a guy you played in the Playoffs a couple times.  How do you look back on your battles over the years, what you think it will be like to see him in other Playoff series, what he's done for them? Le",
        "5": "You have high expectations of yourself.  With AD and the way he works, is anything you've accomplished or pushed yourself this year a reflection of having him around, seeing the way he works? Le",
        "6": "Nikola can do a lot of things, score, rebound.  Are you drawn to the way he can see the floor and pass?  Seems like you share that ability.  How much joy do you get out of that part of your game? Le",

        "12": "Frank was praising you and AD not just for your talent but the way that you guys set the tone throughout the season with creating a sense of urgency with the club in practice and film sessions, games.  How do you approach that overall this season? Le"

      "answers": {
        "0": "Like I said in my post, when I posted about it, I'm truly blessed.  I'm kind of at a loss for words.  I've been fortunate enough to be able to take care of my body, push my body to the limits, that maybe at times when I was younger I didn't think I could get to. I never put a ceiling on what I can do in this league.  I think one of the things I pride myself on is being available to my teammates.  It's allowed me to sit here at this point and talk about what we're talking about now. Anytime I'm linked with some of the GOATs that have played this game, it's an unbelievable thing.  You mentioned Timmy D, Kareem, Kobe as well.  Just some GOATs that have played this game, paved the way for myself.  Hopefully I'll leave it, when I'm done with my career, in a better place than what I started because of what they did, the groundwork they did, the examples they set.  Just blessed to be a part of this.",
        "1": "It doesn't feel like anything, to be honest.  It feels like we're preparing for an extremely dangerous, extremely well-coached, extremely great team in the Nuggets.  That's been our only focus.  At the same time, we've also been putting in our work individually before we knew who our opponent was, getting our individual work in, team work in, keeping our minds, bodies and souls up to speed, not losing focus of what the main thing is. We're here to compete for a championship.  That's what our mindset has been, no matter how many days we've had in between games, who our opponent has been.  We respect all our opponents because they're great teams.",
        "2": "To the first question, very resilient, very confident, very driven, very well-coached team.  It takes a lot of energy, effort, a lot of desperation to be able to come back from a 3-1 deficit.  They did it twice.  So the respect level is out of this world for what we have for this ballclub.  That's how we're going into this series, understanding what they're capable of, where they stand. Yes, my thumb is fine.  I don't remember what game it was in the Houston series, I tried to block a shot.  My thumb got caught in the rim a little bit.  Just trying to do the treatment and keep myself healthy for the game.  But it won't affect me in any way, shape or form.",
        "3": "When you work hard on your craft, you see others working just as hard on their craft, it becomes organic and it becomes mutual respect.  I know how much Coach Mo put into our schemes, put into our productivity, put into what we needed to do to go out and win ballgames when we were together in Cleveland.  I saw that. So the respect level, just seeing what he was putting into his craft, it made it easy for me to grow likeness to him.",
        "4": "He's a winning guy.  He was that at Utah in his early days, Atlanta and Denver as well.  It's not hard to implement winning players into any situation.  That's why it's been so seamless for him.  A guy who is always consistent, who does what it takes to help the team win and is always like a sense of calmness.  He's a veteran.  He's been in Playoff matchups. He's been in big games.  For the young guys, someone they can always lean on.",
        "5": "I want to say no because I've never needed anyone to push me.  I'm an only child so I had to push myself.  But in the sense of being older than AD, I think it's showing him how much I put into my craft, and hopefully it trickles down to him. I feel like I would be cheating him if he came to be a part of this and I was cheating the game in some way, shape or form.  It's not an example I would ever set for any of my teammates, not just AD, but anybody I ever played with.  You can ask any of my teammates.  I just put that much work into my craft.  That's what it's about.",
        "6": "It's probably the best part of the game, being able to get your teammates involved, putting the ball on time, on target, being able to see things happen before they happen, seeing the reward go to your teammates.  It's just the best part of the game.",
        "7": "Yes.  It's just infectious.  When you have the best player on the team, one of the best players on the team, not really caring about himself at all for the better of the team, that sends a message to the rest of the group.",
        "8": "Well, it's great to be playing the way we're playing right now.  It's the postseason, and that's when you want to kind of hit your stride.  We still have a ceiling that we feel like we can get better.  It's our job not to put a cap on where we can go.  We know as the series goes on, we start to get more and more comfortable with our opponent, with our schemes, with our system of what we want to do.  We hope we can continue that in this series. Starting from Game 1, being as great as we can be, then figuring out ways we can be even better going into Game 2, so on, so on.",
        "9": "I don't have a comment about it really.  I was just sitting back and watching the game from a fan's perspective, seeing big shots be made, big plays being made, missed shots, things of that nature.  I was also as a scout, scouting both teams at the same time.  I was trying to get as many log-in minutes for myself personally scouting both teams at the same time because we knew Game 7 will decide who we'll play.  That was kind of my mindset.",
        "10": "What were we settling?",
        "11": "(Shaking head.)",
        "12": "I mean, it's just who I am personally.  I don't like the way season ended for us last year, especially for myself with the injury, the things I went through last year personally, then with our ballclub.  I didn't like the way that ended. My mindset coming into the season was already pretty much locked in just from the summertime, putting in my work, me training, getting up at 4 a.m., train before I was shooting \"Space Jam,\" things of that nature. When we were able to get AD and acquire Coach Vogel, having the battles I had with him, his Indiana Pacers team, I already knew what he would bring to the table as well. I was excited about the opportunity to link with Coach Vogel, the players we were starting to sign, things of that nature.  That's what it's all about.  Just excited, man, to get back to work whenever that was happening.  Like I told you guys earlier in the season, my mom told me, Don't talk about it, be about it. I didn't really say much. Just go out and do your job and live with the results. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

But throughout the whole fourth quarter and at the end of the game, everybody was like, \"That was pretty damn fun.\" That was fun. Having to play for a set number and seeing that -- I've watched a lot of basketball in the summertime, and I forgot the name of the league where the guys, you know, their alma mater, they go back and play for their teams and things of that nature, they have a set number they have to get to that, that $2 million championship tournament. Maybe you don't watch basketball in the summer.",
        "1": "Yeah, that was extremely fun and a great way to end 2020 NBA All-Star Weekend.",
        "2": "No, there was no discussion because we're all competitors. We wouldn't be All-Stars if we weren't competitors. We all compete at the highest level, try to put our respective teams in position to win every night. So guys definitely just had that sense of pride, that sense of competitiveness throughout the season, throughout the All-Star Game, which we had tonight. But you could definitely feel his presence just from the start. From every moment from the fans chanting his name till you seen the numbers. Every time you saw Giannis' team run on the floor, you saw the 2-4. So he was definitely here.",
        "3": "No, it was not. We had a great play call for Kawhi to get to his sweet spot. They kind of doubled. They doubled A.D. at the beginning of the play and left James open in the corner. James drove baseline, kicked it to C.P., C.P. drove it and hit me. They were kind of all scattered, and A.D. had Kyle Lowry on him at the time, and he just got a great duck-in and seal, and I was able to throw the ball and get the foul. It was not planned, but just smart basketball.",
        "4": "It doesn't matter. At the end of the day, you can win a Finals game at the free-throw line. There's a lot of things that happen on the playground that you can't do in our game too, where you can literally foul every single time and not get disqualified. I've been in games where you've won games at the free-throw line, and that's all part of the game. If he would have missed both, no one would have been talking about it. It's all part of the game, and it was a hell of a way to win a game just from an All-Star perspective.",
        "5": "Listen, man, Chicago is right up there with one of the top cities in the world with producing some of the greatest basketball players to ever play the game. If you just even step outside, some of the best basketball players that played the game. So you have some of the greatest, some very good, some very talented. You've even got Ben Wilson, who was on his way to being a star and obviously we know the story about that. So you got it all the way from grade-school era through high school, through college, and then so many pros and so many Hall of Famers. K.G. is about to go into the Hall of Fame soon. I seen his name on the ballot, and he's from Chicago. The great Isiah Thomas. D-Wade at some point will go into the Hall of Fame. My teammate Anthony Davis right now will go in the Hall of Fame. This city is right up there as one of the best cities in the world as far as producing the best players we've ever seen.",
        "6": "I don't mind being Kobe this weekend.",
        "7": "That's fine. My mom might not like it, but I'm okay with it.",
        "8": "Just being part of the Redeem Team in 2008. We have so many off-the-court memories from that team. Either if it was just about basketball or going into some Team USA other events. We were able to see Michael Phelps swim. We were able to see the women's national team play a lot of their games. We were able to go around track and field. We did a lot of things besides play basketball throughout that whole Redeem Team run that we had when we brought home gold. So, a lot of memories for sure.",
        "9": "What's the most that I take from this weekend as far as --",
        "10": "I mean, anything else would be uncivilized. He's one of the greatest basketball players, one of the most impactful players, and the inspiration that he has, it's showing. How many people not only in the basketball world, but also outside the basketball world, that was touched by a person such as himself. Obviously, we all saw what he was able to do on the floor as a competitor, as a champion, someone who strived for excellence every single day, but we also saw the father he was as well to his beautiful daughters and to his wife. The things that he was doing, winning an Oscar, just doing so many things that was just -- that people would aspire to do and gaining inspiration from him because of his drive. So I haven't -- I think it's been amazing, and I'm happy to be a part of it this weekend. Obviously, me being a Los Angeles Laker myself, it's going to be a part of me for the rest of my life and our franchise, and any player to ever wear purple and gold until the end of basketball, which is never. So it's a beautiful time. It's a beautiful day. And his presence was felt here in Chicago. So appreciate it. Thank you. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "I don't believe in pressure. If you work on your craft and you dedicate yourself to your craft, then whatever happens, happens. I'm not one to believe in pressure much.",
        "1": "I think it's always just important to give back to the youth. You guys are our future. You guys have beautiful minds, spirit. Energy is always high. I was a young kid growing up in the inner city with not many resources, not much help. So for me to be able to be in the position I am today to be able to give back, not only to my hometown, but go all over the world and inspire people and inspire kids and inspire the youth, I think it's just as important as what I do on the basketball floor.",
        "2": "I always appreciate it. It's the game that I love. It's the game that I fell in love with when I was a little boy. So for me to be a part of All-Star Weekend here with all the fans all around the world that we have that support our beautiful game, I never take this moment for granted.",
        "3": "I already respected Frank just from a competitive standpoint, and when I was in Miami competing versus the Indiana Pacers teams. You saw how they were always prepared. They were dedicated to their game plan. They were always ready for our matchups every time we played them. The battles we had versus those teams in Indiana. Didn't need to have a level of respect because it was already there from the jump.",
        "4": "By the Commissioner allowing an actual week to happen, with that change, it's definitely helped out a lot not only for the guys that are not a part of All-Star Weekend, but for the guys that are part of it. I try to find at least a couple days to kind of decompress and get away from the game. Obviously, when you come to All-Star Weekend, basketball is going to be the main thing and the main thing only. That's why you're here. That's what you see every day. We're dedicated to this weekend for not only ourselves and our family, but for the fans. So I try to find a couple days after All-Star, after Sunday, to kind of just get away from the game, try to freshen back up and get ready for the last run of the regular season.",
        "5": "We know that he's watching over us. It's our responsibility to just represent the purple and gold not only for him but for all the greats, everybody that's ever come through the Lake Show. I really don't want to sit up here and talk about it too much. It's a very, very sensitive subject, but he's with us every day.",
        "6": "Just embrace it. If he has his family with him, let them enjoy it. Let them go around and see pretty much everything. It's not promised that you'll be here next year. But the way he's playing, he'll probably be here a lot. But embrace it. Like I said, I'm a guy who always lives in the moment. I don't think about tomorrow because it's not promised. The only thing I can worry about is today and how much I can make an impact today. So embrace it, have fun. It's a great weekend. There are a lot of things to do not only for yourself but also for your family. Enjoy it.",
        "7": "Oh, it was a very joyous moment for my community, for myself, for my friends, just having the greatest basketball player ever coming back and playing the game. I needed that inspiration. Growing up in the inner city, I kind of lost a super hero when he retired. Someone that I kind of needed to help me some way, somehow, even though he didn't know it, along with some other athletes and people. It was incredible. It was so exciting when he said he was coming back. Obviously, the basketball world and everybody else that loves him and loves the sport was ecstatic about it as well.",
        "8": "I don't know. How can you be a bad GM when you're picking 24 of the best players in the world?",
        "9": "Being part of Team USA is always fun. To represent the United States of America, that red, white and blue is such a pride thing. Obviously, with my name being one of the names in the list of players that just came out not too long ago, it's just an honor even to be mentioned. So we'll see what happens. Obviously, I've got a long season hopefully still left with the Lake Show. So we'll tackle that after the season.",
        "10": "I think just having a voice, having control over your own narrative, being passionate about what you believe in no matter if other people don't approve of it, or disapprove of it. So for me, it was never just about basketball for me. I know my inspiration, and I know how many more people that I inspire that don't even play the game of basketball. So I just feel like I could give so much more than just dribbling a basketball. I just got to try to continue to inspire the youth. Inspire as many people as I can all over the world, make an impact as much as I can and then live with the results after that.",
        "11": "I don't know. I'm not done. Like I just said, I'm not one to think about 20 or 30 years from now. Tomorrow is not promised, and you've got to live today. We shall see what happens, but I'm not one to think about 20, 30 years. Like I said, I'm happy to be right here in the presence of y'all and being able to answer a few questions.",
        "12": "One, try to be better than I am. Use as much as you want. Use what I do. You could use my platform, use my words. You can use the inspiration that I try to give. But any way you can be great at doing what you love to do, you got to commit to it. You can't want something but not put in the work. It doesn't matter what you're doing in life, no matter what it is. It could be a professional athlete. It could be an artist. It could be a doctor. Anything in the world. A president of the United States. You've got to put the work in, and I think if you put the work in, the results will happen organically. And most important, you've got to find happiness too. If you're having fun, enjoying what you're doing, then it makes it so much easier. It makes it so much easier to want to do it every day because it's something that you really enjoy doing and you don't look at it as work. So best of luck to you, kid. What's your name?",

        "0": "It was our second group that came in -  dame, Klay, Brad Beal, LaMarcus, Ben Simmons, KAT.  They came in and just changed the whole complexion of the game.  We got stops, and, obviously, Dame and Klay caught fire from behind the arc, and allowed us to get back into the game and allowed us take a one-point lead going into the fourth.",
        "1": "I feel great.  Sorry to cut you off, Joe, but I feel great.  Looking forward to the second half of the season.  Looking forward to seeing what we can do to get back in this playoff race.  That's my only mindset. That's the only thing that's going to happen in my mental space for these next two months, pretty much on how I can get this team playing the type of level of basketball we were playing before my injury.",
        "2": "It meant everything.  Like I've been saying the last couple of days, it's been a bittersweet moment for me with him.  The bitter part is obviously this is the last time being on the same floor together and playing the game we love so much, and obviously all the memories we have, both as competitors, as teammates, so on and so on.  Playing here in the States, playing abroad with Team USA and doing what we've been doing for so many years. And then the sweet part of it, seeing him be able to go off on his own terms, saying when he's done and nobody forced him out or did anything of that nature.  He's able just to hang it up when he was ready to hang it up and be at peace with it all.  So that's real sweet of it.",
        "3": "First of all, it's incredible to have your first All-Star start in your own building.  For that to be today for Kemba has been great.  He's the all-time leader in points for a reason, but he's made this franchise relevant because of his maturation process and the way he's continuing to get better and better each and every year. So it's just great to see what he's been able to do year after year after year, continue to get better and better and better with his game and also with his leadership.",
        "4": "Great.  He was unbelievable.  Brought back a lot of memories for myself, just a lot of years that we had back in my early days in Cleveland, back in his early days coaching.  Definitely miss him.  I miss being around him every day.  I miss the fire he brings to the game.  Miss his mental side of the game as well. To be able to have this weekend, these last couple days with him has been a really good treat.",
        "5": "You put me on the floor, I love to compete.  I'm a competitor, no matter what it is.  I was competing to see if I can get to this table first.  Did anybody come here before me? THE MODERATOR: No. LeBRON JAMES: See what I'm talking about? See you all the second half of the season. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "To be able to be in a position where I can have my own school, it's not about me.  It's about the kids in there.  It's never been about me.  I'm just a platform, and I'm the voice and the guy that can be able to put it together.  But it's so much deeper than me.  It's not only the kids that are in this school, but it's also the faculty members and the teachers, the security guards, everybody that is inside there.  The chefs, the head chefs, the custodians -- everybody that has anything to do with making sure the IPS School runs on a day-to-day basis and runs smoothly for my kids to be able to succeed. It's an honor, and I take it very seriously.  I check up on my kids weekly to see how they're doing.  It's been great so far, and we want to continue that.",
        "1": "I've always loved Kyrie, from before I met him to when I became his teammate to even now.  I've always thought he was special.  There's a reason why there are only 24 of us here this weekend.  He's here for a reason. The phone call -- more than for me, I think just to see his growth.  It takes a real man and a real person to understand who they are to be able to call or to do anything and be able to see their wrongdoings or believe they have some wrongdoings and then be able to come to grips with that and be able to either apologize or say that, \"At that point in time, I thought I was ready for something, but I really wasn't.\" I really don't want to talk about it too much because it's not for everybody.  It's not for the media to be able to start writing things, and how you guys like to do it.  I'm not saying you in particular, or you, Dave.  I know you guys, but I don't know everybody here. I love Kyrie.  I love everything about Kyrie.  I've loved his family.  I definitely love his shoes and his game, and my kids love his shoes and his game too.  So it's all good.",
        "2": "I think everything in life you have to appreciate, no matter if it's good or bad.  Like you said, it's been one year since the call-out of \"shut up and dribble.\" At that very moment, I knew at that moment that I was bigger than just basketball and I had to say something because it wasn't just about me, it was about all of us.  They'll be telling you guys to shut up and just write, you guys not having a platform.  Or just shut up and be a doctor.  Or just shut up and be a lawyer.  Or just shut up and a teacher.  Or do whatever your occupation is. I just think that's unfair to all of us because we are so much more than what our occupations say or what our name tag says.  So for me to be able to have this platform, as I did one year ago, and for me to be able to have that feeling throughout my body when I heard that, I think it has not only resonated with me, but it's resonated with a lot of people to be able to feel like they can be more. Like I said, I thanked her for that moment, and we all should thank her.  But like I said, you have to appreciate anything that comes along no matter if it's good or bad because it helps you learn.  It helps you become better at who you are.  It helps you get more understanding about who you are and a better understanding of that situation at that point in time.  So I've always been thankful for not only the good but the bad that's come across my life since I've been on this journey.",
        "3": "As much time as I can to get with him.  I'm here.  I've seen him already in the locker room.  I've seen my nephew, Zaire.  Every moment, every bit of time I get with him this weekend is going to be always cherished.  It's great.  We've been together almost 17 years now, since we met at the Combine in Chicago in 2003.  From that moment, we just knew we were going to be together for a long time, and it hasn't stopped. For me being a competitor, for me being his teammate to being a competitor again, for us sharing father advice to sharing marriage advice to sharing son advice, it's really bigger than just basketball when it comes to me and D-Wade.  We can actually look at each other and know what each other's thinking and knowing how each other feels at times in our lives. To be here, for me to be able to choose him to be part of Team LeBron, for him to be here this weekend, it's a bittersweet moment, obviously.  The bitter part of it, that this is his last weekend being in All-Star Weekend and knowing that his journey is coming to an end as far as a basketball player.  But the sweet moment is that we've got so much more life to live together, and we will continue that.",
        "4": "There's a sense of pride every time you're competing, and like you said, I got the opportunity to hand-select my team.  There is a sense of pride.  I know we all saw the way the game was last year, and we're going to try to top it.  Hopefully, it can come down to the wire, like it did last year, but we'll see.  We'll see what happens.",
        "5": "It feels great playing in L.A.  When you look up in the banners and you look at all the championships and you look at all the greats that have come through L.A., from Jerry West to George Mikan and Elgin Baylor to Magic and Kareem, James Worthy, and Kobe, Shaq, whoever you name.  Just to be a part of that franchise and be a part of that history, it means a lot to me. Hopefully, I can do my part where someday I can hang up there with the rest of those guys.

        "1": "I recognize The Finals just ended, but I know you're ready for these questions.  Do you feel like you've played your last game for the Cavs?",
        "2": "How do you want this season to be remembered, given guys in their 15th year don't do this at all.  How do you want this year to be remembered?",
        "3": "Yes.",
        "4": "You've gone through this dance that's coming this summer.  You've gone through this a few times.  Do you anticipate this just because of, like you said, the family and your kid's going into high school and your age and all those things, do you anticipate this summer being the toughest as far as deciding what the right path for you is?",
        "5": "LeBron, how would you characterize these playoffs for you?",
        "6": "And the team.",
        "7": "I know you have no way to know yet whether your time here is over or not, but I'm wondering what playing with the word Cleveland across your chest has meant to you for this second run?",
        "8": "In 2010 you basically were part of a team starting from scratch in 2014, same process, and then four months ago you were able to get to The Finals.  If you had to do that again in your career, basically start a team from scratch, what have you learned from this year that you're a different team in February from what you're playing with in The Finals?",
        "9": "When you tell Rachel you came back because you had unfinished business, does one championship finish that business?",
        "10": "It's not a trick.",
        "11": "When you came back in '14 and we did the thing at InfoCision, understanding that things could change in four years, but you said you don't plan on going anywhere.  You can't go through this again.  What did you mean by that and what's this process like?  This free agency process of having to make a decision?  Can you just take us through and shed some light on what that process is like?",
        "12": "When you made the move in 2010, obviously you had certain goals and things in mind that made you -- pushed you toward that decision, similar to 2014.  Are the decisions or the thought process, priorities, different at age 33, 15 years in than they would have been at those other junctures?",
        "13": "LeBron, whatever you decide this summer, how likely is it that down the road you would want to actually own the Cavs and be the guy in charge here?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "What happened?  Self-inflicted, postgame after Game 1.  Very emotional.  For a lot of different reasons, understanding how important a Game 1 is on the road for our ballclub, what would that have done for us, the way we played, the calls that were made throughout the course of that game. I had emotions on the game was taken away from us.  I had emotions of you just don't get an opportunity like this on the road versus Golden State to be able to get a Game 1, and I let the emotions get the best of me.  Pretty much played the last three games with a broken hand, so that's what it is.",
        "1": "I mean, I have no idea at this point.  The one thing that I've always done is considered, obviously, my family.  Understanding especially where my boys are at this point in their age.  They were a lot younger the last time I made a decision like this four years ago.  I've got a teenage boy, a pre-teen and a little girl that wasn't around as well. So sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I'll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that.  So I don't have an answer for you right now as far as that.",
        "2": "For me personally?",
        "3": "I have no idea.  That's for you guys to kind of figure out how you want to characterize my 15th season.  It's definitely been a whirlwind.  There's been ups and downs.  It's been good, it's been bad. For me, I just try to be consistent throughout the course of the season.  Be the leader I know I can be for this ballclub, for this franchise every night, no matter what was going on from the outside or the inside, and be reliable every single day.  Showing up to work every single day.  Putting in the work and grinding every single day. I have no idea how the story will be talked about of my season, but, I know I punched the clock in every single day.  That's for me to understand that, and I'm okay with that.",
        "4": "No, I feel like '10 was the toughest.",
        "5": "For me personally?",
        "6": "And the team.  I wondered if we could hit a switch some way, somehow, just because the course of the regular season it was just like, I don't know.  You guys ask me a lot, our beat writers kind of ask us throughout the whole season, and then we made the trades.  And right before the playoffs, a couple weeks before the playoffs: Do you feel like your team is ready for the postseason.  I didn't know.  It was just the unknown. I mean, our season was kind of the unknown.  I wondered if we could hit a switch in the postseason.  I figured if I stayed laser sharp, if I came in with the right mentality, if I came in with the right mindset, that I could help fast-track this throughout a lot of the games in the postseason because of my experience and because of some of the other guys that experienced a lot of games.  I was able to do that.  We were able to do that.  I mean, I don't know. I think it's never a success in the postseason when you lose, not for me.  I have no idea. But for me personally, like I said, being reliable to my teammates, being able to play the game at a high level with as many games and as many miles as I have on my body and put together a run like I had in the postseason, it's something that I can kind of remember.  The ending is obviously still fresh and still new, and you never want to lose, especially in this fashion, being a competitor.  But it is what it is.  Like I said, I punch my clock every day.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, at the end of the day, I came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business.  To be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember.  Honestly, I think we'll all remember that.  It ended a drought for Cleveland of 50-plus years, so I think we'll all remember that in sports history. When you have a goal, I think any individual, anybody, male, female, whatever the case may be, when you have a goal and you seek that goal out and you dream about that dream, and you put everything, and you care to -- you guys like this brace, huh (laughing)?  You guys like this cast, huh?  You want me to sit it right here for you (laughing)? I don't even know where I was.  I'm sorry.  Next question.  I'm sorry.",
        "8": "Well, it's definitely not the most comfortable thing to start a team from scratch, because the most important is health, because you need to build chemistry so fast and camaraderie so fast on the floor.  And if you have multiple injuries or you have multiple bodies out, when you're starting fresh, it's too hard. I think with this season, that's what you kind of saw.  The difference between this season and the difference between my first year in Miami, we didn't have many injuries at all.  And we were definitely fresh together.  But myself and D-Wade and Bosh, you know, UD (Udonis Haslem), Mike Miller had a few injuries, but (Mario) Chalmers was available, and pretty much our team, we were pretty solid as far as being injury -- not being injury-prone. Obviously, my first year back here we were headed in the right direct, and then we hit the postseason.  Kev had a separated shoulder, and then Kyrie goes down in the first, second possession of overtime of Game 1 in The Finals. So, I mean, that's just huge.  So being a part of the start-fresh mode is something that you definitely don't want to be a part of.  It has its pros and it definitely has its cons.",
        "9": "I mean, that's a trick question at the end of the day, and I'm not falling for that.",
        "10": "Yes, it is.  I mean, for me, I still have so much to give to the game.  Like I said, when you have a goal and you're able to accomplish that goal, it actually -- for me personally, it made me even more hungry to continue to try to win championships, and I still want to be in championship mode.  I think I've shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode.",
        "11": "Well, I mean, I'm not going to take you throughout the whole process.  That's not fun.  But at the end of the day, like I said, when I decide what I'm going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last, you know, 20 years, pretty much, will have a say-so.  Then it ultimately will come down to me, and so we'll see what happens.",
        "12": "No, I don't think so.  I made the move in 2010 to be able to play with talented players, cerebral players that you could see things that happen before they happened on the floor, and your teammate can do the same throughout the course of a season, throughout the course of a game, throughout the course of a playoffs, throughout the course of a Finals. So when you feel like you're really good at your craft, I think it's always great to be able to be around other great minds as well and other great ballplayers, in my instance, and other great just, I think, studies of the game itself. That's never changed.  Even when I came here in '14, I wanted to try to surround myself and surround this franchise with great minds and guys that actually think outside the box of the game and not just go out and play it.",
        "13": "Well, that top athlete money-per-year thing came out last week and I was sixth, so I'm in no way, shape and form putting myself in a position right now to own a team.  I think Floyd (Mayweather) was 1 at like 252.  Obviously, I don't have a boxing hand.  So boxing won't be the sport I'll be going to.  I don't know. At the end of the day, for me, staying around the game, being around the game will be something I'll probably do for the rest of my life, either while I'm playing for this later stage of my career, advising people in the NBA or whatever the case may be.  I've got two boys that play the game as well.  So I don't know.  I can't predict the future on ownership and things of that nature. But I have a lot of knowledge of the game.  I understand talent.  I know talent.  I know the right questions to ask certain guys and see if they're smart enough to actually think the game as well.  So we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "How much has the load that you've had to carry offensively this season affected your ability to play defense at the level that you're capable of?",
        "1": "There's always so much conversation about the Warriors offense, but what is it that makes their defense unique?",
        "2": "You mentioned the trades.  When it happened, there wasn't much said by either of you.  Do you ever look back now and wish that you still had Dwyane Wade?",
        "3": "There is a maximum of four more games to the season for you guys.  I know you're a live-in-the-moment type of guy.  But when you look back at the 2017-18 season, what makes you feel good about the Cleveland Cavaliers and what you guys did?",
        "4": "Completely different direction, but you said the other day when you were on FaceTime with Zhuri (James), your eye freaked her out.  Does it freak you out when you look in the mirror?  It's still as bright as the YouTube symbol.",
        "5": "Golden State this year, this has been probably the hardest of the four years for them just because they were dealing with some doubt for the first time.  Steph Curry got hurt late.  Obviously, they got challenged big time in the West Finals.  As a fan of the game, as a student of the game, what have they shown you as far as their toughness and resiliency this year that wasn't really called on a whole lot in '15-' 17?",
        "6": "A non-Finals one.  It's not uncommon to see you courtside when Bronny is playing, of course.  What's that process been like for you watching him develop?  Obviously there's got to be some burdens on him being LeBron James Jr., of course.  But what's it been like for you watching him grow?",
        "7": "How does the outcome of these three games impact your love for competition and your mental approach to a challenge that has become even bigger now?",
        "8": "Kevin Love said after Game 1 that you've said to him this is the best you've ever felt.  You've obviously played in every game.  How much of a source of pride is that to you to have played this many games at this level?  Also, is this the best you've ever felt physically?",
        "9": "As a quick follow-up on the ankle.  The TV cameras kind of caught you like turning it or putting it back into place.  Did you fix your ankle on the court?",
        "10": "You mentioned getting ready for Game 4 tomorrow.  A difficult finish last night.  But what did you see when you reviewed the game this morning that you can take as a positive heading into Game 4 for your performance in Game 3?",
        "11": "You first faced Kevin Durant on this stage back in 2012.  I think he was 23 at the time.  You guys beat him 4-1.  Did you leave that series at all thinking like that guy's going to be a roadblock down the line, really on this stage a lot?",
        "12": "Do you remember anything specifically in that series that he showed you?  Obviously, he was already a good player to that point.",
        "13": "I guess in your career, this started with the Celtics getting Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, then you go to Miami with D-Wade and Chris Bosh to try to take those guys out.  You come back here with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and the next thing you know the Warriors have Kevin Durant.  How do you view that dynamic where players, superstars in this league are able to kind of control their own destiny to some degree?  Or is there a level of disappointment having now been maybe on the other side of that a little bit that you put in all this work to put a team together and build it a certain way and put in all the work, and someone just comes along and puts something else together that might be better?",
        "14": "You mentioned in the first part of your answer, when you were here the first time, you came to the conclusion you didn't have enough.  I'm not trying to get you to say anything negative about anybody.  But how do you feel now?",
        "15": "I don't know what your answer is."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't think it's affected it.  The load that I have to carry offensively, it's been what the season has asked for.  Obviously, we haven't had many playmakers throughout the course of the season.  We had some early on, and we made the trades and things of that nature. But it's been what the season has called for, and I've taken that responsibility to be able to have to make plays for myself and make plays for my teammates as well. Defensively, we've surrounded ourselves with some more wing defenders this year that allowed me to not have to exert so much energy defensively.  But whenever the number has been called for me to defend, I've been always taking that responsibility.  So I don't think that's changed.",
        "1": "Draymond (Green).  Draymond is a catalyst and the anchor for their defense.  Very, very smart defensively.  He knows pretty much every set.  He kind of flies around and dictates their defense, either on the perimeter or protecting the rim as well.",
        "2": "Oh, absolutely.  I mean, listen, not only from a brotherhood aspect and what we know about one another, and also from an experience factor.  I believe that he would have been very, very good for us in the postseason.  He's a guy that's kind of built for the postseason at this point in his career, who lives for the moment. So definitely, definitely think about that.  It seems so long ago that he was even a part of this ballclub, but definitely think about it from time to time.",
        "3": "That's too hard for me to answer right now.  Like I said, I can answer that once this series is over.  Like I told you guys before, this has been one of the most challenging seasons of my career from the standpoint of what's been going on with our ballclub.  Not only from a playing perspective, but things -- guys changing, personnel changing, Coach being out for a couple weeks, players leaving and being out for a couple of weeks, injuries and things of that nature. I was having a great couple months, and then not playing so well, and then trades happened and things of that nature.  So I can go into more detail once this series is over.  But it's been three or four, maybe four or five seasons wrapped in one, that's for sure.",
        "4": "Yeah (laughing).  It's weird.  It's weird seeing it.  Hopefully, it will go away soon.  But it is what it is.  It's just part of a war wound.  And that's what happens when you're in the war sometimes; you get some injuries.  It hasn't stopped me from preparing, but it's different.",
        "5": "At the end of the day, you can never count out a champion, no matter what's going on in the course of their season.  It's impossible to do that, because they're built from a different cloth, and I know that firsthand. When you win a championship and you're around guys for a long period of time, and you know what you're capable of doing, all you need is to get healthy.  If you can get healthy and guys are playing at the right level at the same time, then you can feel like you can beat anybody. So the best thing about their team is that if one of their stars goes down, they have two or three other stars that are still able to hold the ship until everybody gets back.  Steph's injury, him going down, K.D. and Klay, who never misses a game, and Draymond still being in the lineup -- if you look at the previous time when K.D. went down, the rest of those guys were in and held it until K.D. came back for the playoffs the year before that. When you have the luxury of not being pressured to come back so fast -- and even with Iguodala, him not being pressured to feel like he needs to get back on the floor to help the team win, that the guys are going to continue to play well and whenever you're ready, we'll be ready for you to join.  I think it helps the injury as well, because you're not putting that much pressure on yourself. You can never count out a champion at the end of the day, no matter how vulnerable people may seem or people think they may be, or if they hit some adversity.  I think it's all part of the process.",
        "6": "It's been a treat to watch, being a parent and seeing my son grow as a basketball player. But not only that, being a young man who he is today; the kid will be 14 soon.  Just seeing him grow and grow and grow to become who he is today has been a treat. I think from the burden of him having the name itself, I think him understanding that just go out and just play the game and have fun and play for your teammates and give it all you've got.  You play hard, you play smart and have fun, and let everything else take care of itself. The one thing that I have is the luxury of knowing everything that he can expect.  There's nothing that can hit him that I haven't seen in my life.  There is no obstacle that he will run into that I haven't been a part of that I can't coach him. At the end of the day, he's still going to have to live his own life and find his own path.  But I hope he turns off his comments on social media.  That would be the smartest thing he can do.",
        "7": "No, listen, I love to compete.  At the end of the day, no matter win, lose or draw, being a part of the biggest stage in our sport is something that I've always loved and never taken for granted. My love of the game continues to get bigger and bigger and greater and greater, and hopefully my game and my health continue to be at a level it is today for some years to come.",
        "8": "I think the simple fact to be available to my teammates every single night and knowing that I will be in uniform, that's the pride factor right there that I don't take for granted. And that's something I take a lot of pride in, just working my body every single day, no matter if it's a win, if it's a loss.  No matter if we're getting in at three o'clock in the morning, four o'clock in the morning, waking up the next day and doing something, either from a treatment side, lifting, conditioning, shooting or just preparing myself for the long journey. I just feel like I'm in a great groove right now as far as my career, as far as my body, knowing what I need to do to be in the best possible shape.  I said this at one point throughout this playoff run -- I had a walk-off with Cassidy Hubbarth after the game, and I told her it's the best I've felt in my career. She kind of gave me one of those Cassidy looks, and I got some response from that.  But I was very truthful about it. I still feel good, even with turning my ankle last night or getting a finger jammed into my eye and taking the bumps and bruises and grinds throughout this playoff series.  I still feel like I'm excited to put on the uniform tomorrow.  So, yeah.",
        "9": "I don't (laughing) -- I'm a little weird.  That's all.  Just a little weird.",
        "10": "From a team aspect?  We just had great moments.  We had great moments.  It's hard for me.  I'm not a guy that takes positives from games.  If you lose, it's negative to me.  It's just how I am.  You can take little bits and pieces and say, OK, well, we played great for the first 24 minutes, but then we didn't play well for that 12 minutes in the third quarter.  We should know that Golden State is the best third quarter team in the NBA, and they try to put you away in that third quarter. The fourth quarter, we had opportunities.  They scored, we came right back.  They hit momentum plays -- they went up 4, we came down and hit a 3.  Made it a one-possession game. You've just got to try to hunker down and get stops and try to create a little space.  But we weren't able to do that.  So there were some positives, but there were a lot of negatives as well. In the third quarter, they had six or seven dunks or uncontested layups.  I mean, you can't have that.  You've already got to worry about the three-headed monster shooting from 35 feet in Klay, Steph and K.D.  And then you're giving up layups and dunks to McGee and Draymond and Iguodala and Livingston.  You just can't have that.",
        "11": "Yeah.  I thought it would be in OKC.  I thought we'd have to face them for a while.  Yeah, absolutely.  Who wouldn't see that?",
        "12": "I mean, in that series, I don't know.  I mean, it's Kevin Durant at 23.  It's Kevin Durant at 18, it's Kevin Durant at 20, 21, 22.  There's nothing that Kevin Durant could show me at 23 that would make me like, Oh, years from now -- no, Kevin Durant was great at 23.  As you get older and older, your game gets more and more seasoned.  But everyone knew that.  That's Kevin Durant. So it's not like you would think that he would fizzle out.  You knew he was built for greatness from the time that he was drafted.  I mean, everybody knew that besides Portland, I guess.  Sorry, Portland.  Sorry.",
        "13": "Yeah, that's the challenge in this league.  I think every GM and every president and every coaching staff is trying to figure out how they can make up the right matchups to compete for a championship and win a championship. Like you said before, I felt like my first stint here I just didn't have the level of talent to compete versus the best teams in the NBA, let alone just Boston.  When you looked at (Rajon) Rondo and KG and Paul (Pierce) and Ray, you knew they were great basketball players.  But not only great basketball players, you could see their minds were in it, too, when you were playing them.  They were calling out sets.  Rondo was calling out sets every time you come down.  It was like, OK, this is bigger than basketball. So not only do you have to have the talent, you have to have the minds as well.  I knew that my talent level here in Cleveland couldn't succeed getting past a Boston, getting past the San Antonios of the league or whatever the case may be. I played with D-Wade, I played with Bosh in the Olympics.  I knew D-Wade for years.  I knew their minds.  I knew how they thought the game, more than just playing the game.  Obviously, we all knew their talent, but I knew their minds as well.  So I linked up with them.  We went to Miami.  Got some other great minds in Mike Miller; UD (Udonis Haslem) is a great mind but also a competitor.  And guys that were talents.  You build that talent.  That's what you want to try to do. Then you come here.  I knew Kyrie, having the talent, I wanted to try to build his mind up to fast track his mind because I felt like in order to win you've got to have talent, but you've got to be very cerebral too. Listen, we're all NBA players.  Everybody knows how to put the ball in the hoop.  But who can think throughout the course of the game? This is so challenging for me to sit up here and say because people who really don't know the game don't really know what I'm talking about.  They just think that you go out, and, Oh, LeBron, you're bigger and faster and stronger than everybody, you should drive every single time and you should dunk every single play and you should never get tired, never.  Like it's a video game and you went on the options and you turned down fatigue all the way to zero and injuries all the way down to zero (laughing). So we come back here and we get the minds and we build a championship team.  And then Golden State, because of Steph's injuries early on in his career and his contract situation, and then them drafting Draymond and drafting Klay and them being under the contracts they were in, allowed their franchise to go out to get K.D. So they win a championship.  Then we play them and we come back from 3-1 and we beat them.  But that was the best regular season -- probably the best team I had ever played against.  They go 73-9, and then you add one of the best players that the NBA has ever seen. So now everyone is trying to figure that out.  How do you put together a group of talent but also a group of minds to be able to compete with Golden State, to be able to compete for a championship?  That's what GMs and presidents and certain players -- it's not every player.  Every player does not want to -- sad to say, but every player doesn't want to compete for a championship and be in a position where every possession is pressure. You had a follow up, it looks like (laughing).",
        "14": "You actually are trying to get me to say something (laughing).",
        "15": "Listen, at the end of the day, I'm living in the moment now.  I went back for you for your question.  We've had an opportunity to win two of these games in this three-game series so far, and we haven't come up with it.  Obviously, from a talent perspective, if you're looking at Golden State from their top five best players to our top five players, you would say they're stacked better than us. Let's just speak truth.  Kevin Durant.  You've got two guys with MVPs on their team.  And then you've got a guy in Klay who could easily be on a team and carry a team, score 40 in a quarter before.  And then you have Draymond, who is arguably one of the best defenders and minds we have in our game.  So you have that crew. Then you add on a Finals MVP coming off the bench, a number one pick in Livingston and an All-Star in David West and whatever the case may be.  So they have a lot of talent. We have a lot of talent as well.  We've been in a position where we could win two out of these three games.  So what do we have to do?  Do we have to make more shots?  Is it we have to have our minds into it a little bit more?  Is it if there is a ball on the ground we can't reach for it but you've got to dive for it? When you're playing, like I stated last night, or like 12 hours ago -- was it 12 hours ago? -- the room for error versus a team like this is slim to none.  And I think I said last night it's like playing the Patriots.  It's like playing San Antonio.  The room for error is slim to none.  When you make mistakes they make you pay, because they're already more talented than you are but they also have the minds behind it, too, and they also have the championship DNA.

    "date": "June 6, 2018",
    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "0": "The core of this Cavs team has remained consistent for the last few years, but you've got a lot of new teammates on this team from a few months ago.  Are you confident that your teammates can mentally reset after this tough loss and be where they need to be for Game 4?",
        "1": "You twisted your ankle pretty badly there in the first half.  How is that feeling?  And Kevin Love was just in here and he talked about the margin of error being so small with the Warriors, especially in Game 1 and Game 3.  But how does that give you guys confidence going forward knowing how close you actually were to win those games?",
        "2": "Two questions and both are bigger picture.  Now that you've been in this series with Durant and the Warriors now twice, can you articulate just how Durant has changed the complexion of this series and rivalry?",
        "3": "The other one, I understand you guys are down 3-0, but you've been very close twice, and they almost lost in the Western Finals.  So the question is are they at all maybe more vulnerable than you thought they were earlier in the year, mid-year, something like that?",
        "4": "Even for someone like you who notoriously can have singular focus on one thing more often than not, how difficult will the next 48 hours be to just lock in on Game 4 and not think about how 1 and 3 got away or what might happen this summer?  How tough would it be for you to stay in this moment?",
        "5": "Do you just tip your hat when K.D. makes the same shot from the left wing he made in Game 3 last year?  And how difficult is the shot?  He may make it look pretty attainable, but how difficult a shot is that?",
        "6": "Last game Steph goes off, an NBA Finals record, nine threes.  This time you hold him to 1 of 10 and another guy goes off.  Defensively what can you do to stop enough of them to a degree that you can have more points than they at the end of the game?  Also, could you speak to Rodney Hood's contributions tonight?",
        "7": "Knowing that you had that tremendous recall of moments in games, can you describe what was in your mind both tonight and last year when Kevin Durant launched that shot from the wing?",
        "8": "Did it feel like last year to you?  Did you think of it at that moment?",
        "9": "Going back to the margin for error thing, when you're playing against a team like the Warriors, how much stress do you feel throughout the course of the game?  Is that something that can wear on you mentally in a way that it doesn't for other opponents?",
        "10": "The margin for error, knowing that it's small going into a game.  Can you talk about the level of stress that you feel throughout the course of a game knowing that, and does it wear on you mentally in a way that it wouldn't with other opponents?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, it's definitely a tough loss, and we had our chances.  But we have another opportunity on Friday to win on our home floor.  We've been pretty good throughout the postseason. So that's a good thing for us that we have an opportunity to extend the series, but we've got to come out and play 48 minutes.  We know this team that we're going against are the best -- first of all, the best third quarter team in the NBA, and once again they showed that tonight by outscoring us by 8 after we had a lead at halftime. So we have to be dialed in and play like we did in the first half and in the fourth quarter tonight.",
        "1": "To answer your second question first, the margin of error is very low.  You can't -- I mean, it's almost like playing the Patriots, you can't have mistakes.  They're not going to beat themselves.  You know, so when you're able to either force a miscue on them, you have to be able to capitalize and you have to be so in tuned and razor sharp and focused every single possession.  You can't have miscommunication, you can't have flaws, you can't have \"my faults\" or \"my bads\" or things like that, because they're going to make you pay.  When they make you pay, it's a 3-0 or 6-0 or 9-0 run, and it comes in bunches. The room for error, you just can't have it.  We know throughout the course of a 48-minute game there are going to be plays where, you know, it was a miscue there, it was a miscue there.  But for the most part throughout 48 minutes you just can't have a bunch of those, not especially against this team. To answer your first question, yeah, I twisted it pretty good, but I'll be in the lineup on Friday.",
        "2": "Oh, well, I mean, you guys ask me what is the difference between the Warriors -- you guys asked me this last year, what was the difference between the Warriors the previous year and this year, and what was my answer?  All right.  There it is.  Kevin Durant was my answer. He's one of the best players that I've ever played against that this league has ever seen.  His ability to handle the ball, shoot the ball, make plays at his length, his size, his speed.  So there it is.",
        "3": "At the end of the day, if you want to compete for a championship or win a championship, you've got to go through the champion, and they're the champion.  No matter -- everyone gets so caught up on saying they're vulnerable or they're not playing so well, and then they go down 3-2, and then they go to somebody else's floor and win.  Or they win at home and send it back to somebody else's floor and win in a Game 7. That's what championship teams do.  That's what championship players do.  They rise to the occasion, and that's what Golden State has done the last four years.",
        "4": "Tim, for me, tonight will be tough.  Tomorrow I'll replay some plays and some moments and things of that nature.  When I wake up Friday morning I'll be locked in on the game plan of what needs to be done to help our team win.  That's just who I am. So the rest of the night will be tough.  I'm not sure what time I'll end up getting to bed.  Tomorrow we'll come in and watch film, so it will replay in my mind throughout the day.  But Friday morning when I wake up, I'll be locked in and ready for Game 4.",
        "5": "No, that wasn't the same shot.  The one he made tonight was about four or five feet behind the one he made last year.  Last year we were up 2, and he pulled up pretty much right at the three-point line and got a great contest, but he made it. Tonight they're up 3.  They come off a pick-and-roll and he just stopped behind and pulled four or five feet behind the three-point line.  So same wing, different location. But you definitely tip your hat.  I mean, that's what he does.  He's a scorer.  You know, he's assassin, and that was one of those assassin plays right there.",
        "6": "That's the challenge right there.  That's the challenge.  You know, that's why they've retooled this team, went out and got K.D. to where there's really not much pressure on -- you know, I won't say any of them to score, but if one of them has a bad game, they have three or four guys that can actually pick up the load. And as you've seen with K.D. picking it up today and Steph picking it up in Game 2, they all have the ability to -- we can't ever forget about Klay.  He's a guy that scored 40 in a quarter before.  So that's the luxury of having guys like that that you can always -- any given moment, they can kind of go off for a game. Even though we held Steph to one three tonight, the one he made was huge, huge.  So we've got to continue to just grind and defend as we did tonight.  I mean, out of the nine threes made, K.D. had six of them.  They were 9 for 36.  And that's, you know, pretty daggone good, holding that team to shooting to the free-throw line.  But we've got to add a little bit more, keep grinding. To your second question, I thought Rodney Hood was Rodney Hood tonight.  That was Rodney Hood, man.  He was just aggressive from the beginning when he got in the game, even though he missed his first three.  He had a wide-open shot, but he just continued to push and push. His athleticism and his length and his touch around the rim, you know, it was more than just what he did for the team, I think for himself, that was just a huge moment for himself.  That was good to see.  That was great to see, actually.",
        "7": "I actually think you should be like a psychiatrist.  You want to keep trying to get inside somebody's mind, is the whole thing, Mark. What's in my mind?  Miss it so we can get the rebound.",
        "8": "No.",
        "9": "Say that again, please?",
        "10": "Well, I can take you back kind of to the battles I had with the Spurs when I was in Miami.  You just knew that they wouldn't beat themselves.  You just knew that like every possession we were playing San Antonio when I was in Miami, you just knew if you made a mistake, Manu, Tim, Tony, Pop will make you pay.  At times they did make us pay, and then you sprinkle in what Gary Neal did to us one game, what Danny Green did to us one game.  Then Kawhi, you just couldn't -- you could never relax. When you have great basketball players but also that can also think the game and be very cerebral about the game, that's what adds the level of stress, because you know that you can never, ever relax. And you should never want to relax.  It's The Finals.  It's the playoffs.  Even though this is a regular season game, you should always want to be on your toes.  That's what the part of competition is about.  So it adds to the level of stress. When you have Timmy D. and Manu and Kawhi and Manu, and now Draymond and Klay, Steph and K.D., and then you sprinkle in Iguodala and Livingston and all those guys as well, it adds a level of stress.  Because you know that you can never relax.  You know if you relax, they make you pay, and making you pay could cost you a game. So it's tough, but it's all part of the competition, which I love and which I continue to lace them up every night. Hopefully I got your answer for you.  Appreciate it.

      "questions": {
        "0": "You always talk about experience be the greatest teacher.  What do you hope your team has learned during this crazy season that can carry you guys forward now?",
        "1": "In training camp, you talked about this in regard to the Warriors.  But do you have any comment on Trump uninviting the Eagles to the White House after most of the black players decided not to go?",
        "2": "Any thoughts on the stand the black players made?",
        "3": "To follow up on that, the Pats sent half their team.  Then Steph came out and said he didn't have any interest in going.  Then you supported Steph on Twitter, I remember.  Does it surprise you that the divide just seems to be growing right now after even more than a year of this discourse?  It seems that the gap is widening instead of any bridge being found.",
        "4": "Just one more layer on that.  LeBron, the Minnesota Lynx won the WNBA title this year, a great series, great final game.  They didn't even get an invite.  You've always been really supportive of the WNBA and women's basketball.  What did you think of that?",
        "5": "You're shooting nearly 50% from the mid range in this postseason.  How confident are you in that shot compared to earlier points in your career?",
        "6": "Ty Lue told us he wants you guys to be more physical against the Warriors tomorrow and Friday.  How difficult will that be to do that and just stay within your normal game?",
        "7": "Everyone talks about home-court advantage, and you guys have clearly had it through these playoffs.  Can you be specific about what it is that makes you play so well in this building?",
        "8": "There is a clip that's gone viral of that Game 1 timeout huddle before going into overtime.  It seemed like you were just finding out that you guys still had a timeout.  What was going through your head at that time?  Was it pretty self-explanatory?",
        "9": "Pretty much?",
        "10": "Could you elaborate a little bit more?",
        "11": "I'm sorry.",
        "12": "So that was more so the reaction from not getting the timeout after you were signaling for it?",
        "13": "You're down 2-0 to Golden State again.  Does this 2-0 feel differently than the previous two seasons?",
        "14": "With that moment between regulation and overtime, like Chris said, it has gone viral --",
        "15": "During those moments between regulation and overtime in Game 1, like Chris said, it has gone viral, meaning you have been getting criticized for not trying to pick up your teammates during that time.  Is that fair criticism, not being in your shoes?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think just being persistent.  We've been very persistent and very resilient throughout this whole season, no matter what has been going on.  We have an opportunity to come home and protect home, as Golden State has done. We look forward to the challenge.  It's a very tall task.  A very tough challenge, as I mentioned before the series even started, going against these guys, going against this team.  But we have an opportunity to seize the opportunity.  So I look forward to that.",
        "1": "I actually just found out about it as I was walking up to the podium.  I didn't really digest it enough.  But it's typical of him.  I'm not surprised.  It's typical of him.  I don't know.  I mean, I know no matter who wins this series, no one wants the invite anyway.  So it won't be Golden State or Cleveland going.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, listen, we have a lot of freedom in our country.  Guys -- men or female -- have the right to do what they want to do in a very respectful manner.  I think if they decided they don't want to go, then they have the right.",
        "3": "I think as long as he's in office, then the communication and things like that are going to continue to happen.  It's a lot of things that we believe in as Americans that we don't feel that he's for.  There are a lot of people that believe that he's not for the people or doing things that's right by the people. So it's not surprising hearing the news today with the Eagles.  But I think more importantly, as Americans and especially people in Philadelphia, we shouldn't let that news take away from what that unbelievable team did and accomplished, what all those players did to sacrifice throughout each and every Sunday, going out and playing the style of football that they played and winning a Super Bowl the way they won it.  Let's not let that accomplishment of things that you will have for the rest of your life, and people will always call you a champion for the rest of your life, let's not let someone uninviting you to their house take away from that moment.  Because I think the championship -- winning a Super Bowl or winning a Stanley Cup or winning a World Series or winning an NBA Championship or National Championship -- is way bigger than getting invited to the White House, especially with him in there, in my opinion.",
        "4": "I think it's laughable at this point.  You always hear the saying: You just laugh to stop you from crying.  I think that's a lot of the instances that are going on as far as outside of the sports world.  But we know how important sports is to our country and how it continues to bring people together, excite people, make people talk about it, no matter if it's here on this stage here or on the streets or on the bus, in the barbershops, in coffee shops or wherever the case may be.  We know sports is so big because it's able to captivate people and bring people together. For them not to even be invited, playing our beautiful game of basketball -- no matter if it's the WNBA or NBA or little leagues or high school, whatever the case may be, it's basketball.  It's our beautiful game.  Those women, those girls, they're unbelievable at doing it.  I think it's laughable, in my opinion.",
        "5": "I'm confident in every part of my game at this point in my career.  I don't believe there are any dare shots that you can dare me to take and I'm not confident with making them.",
        "6": "Well, bringing a physicality to a game, I think, has always been a point of emphasis for our ballclub.  I think it started from Game 1 of the Indiana series.  They were more physical than us, and we realized that the playoffs had started.  The guys that hadn't been a part of the postseason realized that the playoffs were here.  From that point on, physicality has been a point of emphasis.  So I don't think that should change no matter who your opponent is.",
        "7": "Well, first of all, you give a lot of credit to the fans.  The fans bring you so much excitement as well.  I always believe like the role players play much better at home than they do on the road.  They feed off the crowd.  They feed off the familiarity with not only being home but being on their home floor, having their own locker and things of that nature. So I think that's definitely helped us out a lot throughout this postseason thus far.  Pretty much in the postseason since I returned a few years ago.",
        "8": "Pretty much.  It went viral?",
        "9": "Damn cameras (laughing).  I haven't seen it.  I'm not on social media right now.",
        "10": "You're taking me back to Game 1?",
        "11": "I finally got Game 1 out of my head.  You're taking me back, huh?  OK.  OK.  Let me put myself back there. So if I remember, yeah, I was sitting on the bench and kind of just contemplating the last couple seconds of what just happened, what expired, from J.R. [Smith] dribbling the ball out to G-Hill [George Hill] missing the free throw, actually seeing Draymond [Green] step in early on the lane violation.  Asking myself did I have a lane to actually drive it if I didn't.  So there were a lot of things playing through my head. When the game clock went off before J.R. kind of threw the ball to G-Hill to the corner, I actually tried to call timeout.  I believe it was Ed Malloy that was right there, our referee.  I don't know if I had enough time because I was kind of a little bit still in shock of what was going on at that point in time. I got to the bench, first thing that came to my mind I was like, OK, I was calling a timeout.  But hopefully, I'm glad maybe if we didn't have any, I'm glad they didn't give it to me.  I didn't want another C-Webb [Chris Webber] incident.  If that happened, then they go to make their free throws and the game is over. So I asked our coaching staff if we had a timeout.  And they told me, yes.  I guess y'all probably seen the reaction from that point on.",
        "12": "Yeah, it was just knowing that we had an opportunity to have another possession, even with the offensive rebound.  It was just -- it was just a heartbreaking loss.",
        "13": "I mean, I have no idea.  I don't know how I felt last year or the year before that.  I'm not quite sure.  I know it feels like we're down 2-0, and I don't like the way I feel.  I don't like the way -- the mood that I'm in right now, knowing whatever.  There's no, like, OK, you're down 2-0 and you feel better than when you're down 2-0 before. I mean, when you're down like this, in a deficit like this versus a team like this, there's no good feeling.  So I don't feel good about it.",
        "14": "Give me one second, sorry.  [Addressing previous question again] I don't feel good how I feel right now, not how I feel about the rest of the series.  I know how clips can get broken up and somebody can clip that and be like, Oh, LeBron said he doesn't feel good.  I personally don't feel good today of the deficit that we have.  Not about tomorrow.  I feel great about our opportunity.  Go ahead.",
        "15": "Me?  Me being criticized?  No.  You're saying I got criticized for something, right?  I don't believe that.  Not me (Smiling).  I don't care.  I don't care at all. I mean, we're in the NBA Finals.  I mean, how much more picking up of teammates do you want me to do?  I'm in the NBA Finals, looking for a championship.  All right, appreciate it.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you always talk about you've seen every defense that anybody can throw at you.  Did it seem that Golden State came out tonight looking to try to attack you a little bit more earlier in the shot clock and maybe tried to limit you as much to not drive as much?  You ended up with 13 assists, but it seemed like they really made you work hard tonight for everything you got.",
        "1": "Steph set an NBA Finals record tonight with nine three-point shots, but some of them were much more difficult than others.  He had the 23 1/2 seconds of great defense, and goes out 25 feet, turns around and hits one.  How deflating is it when he's got it going and makes shots that almost he has no business making or taking?",
        "2": "Obviously Steph, Klay, K.D. had great games, as expected.  But how dangerous are the Warriors when you have McGee and also Livingston perfect from the field?  I think it was 11 field goals total, 11 for 11.",
        "3": "If you had to point to one or two things that you could take with you as a group going back to Cleveland for Game 3 that makes you feel good about where you could be in this series, what would it be?",
        "4": "When you're facing -- a lot of people feel like the odds are against you in this series.  Do you feel like there is too much pressure put on you to be able to try to do too much for your team?  Is it fair?",
        "5": "You're one of those guys who has said a lot of times -- like you, Dwyane, a lot of guys over the years have said that a series doesn't truly start until one team wins on the other's home floor.  How much are you going to remind your guys that over the next three days?  Just, I mean, as hard as it might be to sell them on, to remind them that Golden State just held serve?",
        "6": "You've been in this situation three years in a row now 0-2.  Can you draw back on some of those experiences in terms of your strategy going forward?",
        "7": "You've always been a guy that played the game with a lot of love, with a lot of joy for the game.  In the moment that you're in right now, with the challenge being as great as it is and the burden on you as great as it is, does it make it harder to find those moments of enjoyment and kind of enjoying the competition as opposed to just continuing to just push and grind through?",
        "8": "You spoke with us yesterday about getting the treatment for your eye.  Still looking a little bloody there.  How was it tonight, and going forward do you think it's something that you just have to learn to work around?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think I only got tired once tonight.  So, I mean, they doubled me a few times when I caught the ball in the post, something they didn't do in Game 1.  So I got off the ball, trusted my teammates.  But as far as working harder, I think I got tired once.",
        "1": "Every shot that he takes that goes in, he has the business of making them.  That's what he does.  So shouldn't be surprised or deflated at it.  Take the ball out, move it forward, and try to execute on the other end.",
        "2": "I mean, they're a dangerous ballclub no matter what.  It starts with those four guys, obviously, the four All-Stars.  Everyone else just does their job, and they don't miss a beat when they put someone in or they take someone out.  You know, it's not something that's surprising.",
        "3": "Well, I think at the end of the day we have a Game 3 to play.  You know, we've got an opportunity to go home, and we played some really good basketball on our home floor.  But that shouldn't give us any comfort.  We should still be uncomfortable with the series as we were in Game 1 and as we were tonight.",
        "4": "No, I don't really get caught up in that.  I mean, the odds have been against me since -- I don't know, since I was five, six years old.  So we're talking about basketball here.  It seems like I come up here and tell you guys this all the time.  The odds have been stacked up against me since I was an adolescent. So I put our team in position to try to win a championship, to compete for a championship.  You know, it's my job to make sure that we're as focused, laser focused as possible, do my job, and continue to instill confidence into my teammates until the last horn sounds. That's my job.  That's my responsibility.  That's my obligation, and I need to continue to do that, which I will.",
        "5": "They did that.  But like I said, we want to continue to be uncomfortable.  Just because we're going home doesn't mean we can relax.  This is the last team in the world you want to relax against.  They've proven they can win on someone else's floor, no matter if it's through adversity as people may call it like when they were going through the Rockets series or whatever the case may be.  They've proven they can win on someone else's floor and do it in any fashion, in any way. I will continue to stay uncomfortable, and I hope our guys continue to stay uncomfortable no matter with us going back home.",
        "6": "No.",
        "7": "Absolutely not.  I mean, it sucks to lose.  It sucks when you go out there and you give it everything that you have and you prep and your mind is in it and your body is in it and you come out on the losing end.  But nothing would ever take the love of the game away from me.  I think the love of the competition is something I live for and something I wake up every day and train my body for and train my mind for. Yeah, I mean, it sucks to lose, that's for sure, but it definitely won't stop me from preparing to be better the next day.",
        "8": "Yeah, I mean, I'm going to have to work around it until it's not bloody anymore.  I mean, it's not going to keep me out of a game.  I'll be active -- what's today?  What is today?  Sunday?  When do we play again?  Wednesday?  So I'll be active.  I'll be in uniform, and I'll continue to try to make plays and help our team be successful and try to get one up on the board. The eye has looked a lot better.  My daughter don't like the way I look right now (laughing).  Yeah, she didn't like the FaceTime that we had earlier.  She was a little weirded out about it.  But I'll be fine.  So everything's good.  Appreciate it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "0": "There is a talking point since Game 1 that you guys are going to be deflated after such a frustrating loss.  I'm just wondering what your response to that is?",
        "1": "How do you expect your team to come out tomorrow?",
        "2": "You've been through adversity your entire life, on the court, off the court.  What have you learned since you were a young player or even a young person about how to overcome adversity that can help you in this particular situation after such a difficult Game 1 loss?",
        "3": "Secondly, George Hill said yesterday that for him Game 1 was the toughest loss in his entire career.  How can you as a leader help lift a player like that who maybe hasn't been through it before?",
        "4": "I know you talked a lot about how important sleep is for your recovery and how vital it is for your performance.  I remember back in Miami Dwyane Wade was always team no sleep.  But I was curious when you believed that sleep was this weapon for you and how that evolved throughout your career, whether you were prioritizing it when you were a rookie and when did that really impact you?",
        "5": "Early in your career did you have the same appreciation for it, or did you just learn over time?",
        "6": "Years ago there was a concept known as the Jordan Rules.  Just certain principles that certain teams believed they had to live by in order to defend him.  Given all the approaches that you've seen throughout your career, all the coverages, all the different looks that you get from game to game in a series like this and even within a game, how would you define the LeBron rules?",
        "7": "What would you say is the biggest difference in how you're defended now versus when you -- early in your career when you first came into the league?",
        "8": "We can't see it under your hat, so how's your eye today?",
        "9": "Did you basically score 51 points with one eye that was blurry?",
        "10": "Can you see now?  Is it still blurry?",
        "11": "As Game 1 was starting, Dan Gilbert sent out a number of tweets basically with his thoughts on how this team made it to The Finals this year.  Were you aware of those tweets, and did you have any reaction to them after the game?",
        "12": "One of the many things that you're obviously notorious for is getting to know the strengths and weaknesses of your teammates, from how they like the ball passed to them to the spin, to the speed.  You've kind of taken that to the next level.  Your time with J.R. Smith, what have you learned about him as far as what you needed to do with him the last 24 to 48 hours to get his mind right for tomorrow night?",
        "13": "Along the line of questioning regarding the LeBron Rules, when you're getting different defensive coverages and switches from different personnel, what sort of things are you reading and trying to take advantage of?",
        "14": "How are they different defensively without Andre so far?",
        "15": "When you first came in the league, the only time you would hear criticism would be from I guess us, media members.  Now with social media and people come up with these memes and these creative bits and whatnot, how have you adjusted to that?  I don't know if you engage or look into that.  Secondly, how have you noticed your teammates or your peers, is it a negative effect on them if they consume that too much?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't really have a response to it.",
        "1": "I expect us to come and play with the same grit that we had in Game 1.  And we made a lot of mistakes in Game 1.  I expect us to be better.",
        "2": "I mean, it's a new day.  For me, I woke up feeling excited about the opportunity for us to get better today.  Excited about the opportunity that presents itself tomorrow. I can never compare the adversity I went through when I was younger compared to playing basketball.  This is just basketball.  This is not adversity.  Not with the things I've been through in my life.  This is fun.",
        "3": "We both went through some of the same emotions.  It's one of the toughest losses I've had in my career as well because of everything that kind of went on with the game and the way we played.  Obviously, we all know what happened in the game. So it was a tough 24 hours not only for G-Hill and for myself but for our whole ballclub, because we put ourselves in a great position to be successful. But like I said, you give yourself a day -- if you need to take two days, OK.  But today you should feel excited about the opportunity to be better and be great and move forward.",
        "4": "I think as you get older, you understand what benefits your body more and more, depending on what you put in your body as far as food and nutrition, things like that, how many hours a night that you try to get.  Obviously, some nights are different from others, but how much optimal sleep you want to get to help your body recover.  How much working out and things that you do. I think every individual is different.  I found a great balance in what helps me be in the best possible shape I can be on a day-to-day basis.  I just try to follow that.",
        "5": "No.  I mean, I was 18 when I came into the league.  I could do whatever I wanted to do.  I could stay up throughout the whole night and play 48 minutes the next night and then not ice after the game and go right home.  I was 18.  I didn't even tape my rookie year.  No, I'm totally different.",
        "6": "I don't think there are LeBron Rules.  I think for me personally, I think a coaching staff puts together a game plan that best suits his team, best suits the individual when going against myself and my teammates, and they try to be successful with that. Obviously we've all heard of the, quote/unquote, Jordan Rules or whatever the case may be and whoever decided to bring that notion up and a way to stop Jordan.  But I think more importantly this is a team game, and coaching staffs put together game plans that best fit their team to stop either that dynamic player but also the rest of the guys on the floor as well.",
        "7": "There were parts of my game that you could disrespect early in my career.  You can't do that now.",
        "8": "It's better.  It doesn't look better, but the docs told me it's better.  It's just going through a stage right now of recovering.  It looks worse than it did during the game, but it feels better.",
        "9": "No, I had some points before that already (laughing).",
        "10": "Well, I'm taking my medication that I've been given by the doctors.  My eye drops and my antibiotic to help me with the recovery as fast as possible.  But it's an eye.  I mean, it's going to recover as fast as it can on its own.  There is nothing you can do.  I can't ice it or anything like that, or if I get more sleep or whatever the case may be.  I'll just have to naturally, organically let heal. Like I said, it's been better.  But it's better today than it was in Game 1.  Like I said, it doesn't look better, but it feels a lot better.",
        "11": "No, not aware.  I'm not on social media right now, so I wasn't aware of that.  It was his account though, right. (Laughter)",
        "12": "I think J.R. is one of the most resilient guys I've ever been around.  I think it just comes from not only him personally but his household -- his mom, his dad, his brothers and sisters.  And his family now as well. He probably took that loss as hard as anybody on the team.  But one thing about J.R., he has an uncanny ability to bounce back.  I think people have seen that throughout our postseason runs, where he hasn't played well or played to his ability that he thinks he should have played, and then the next game he comes on and shoots the ball extremely well.  It's just very locked in. For me, I don't think I need to say anything to J.R.  I've known J.R. since he was in high school.  It's not like he's a new teammate of mine or someone I just met.  J.R. knows what I expect out of him.  He expects things out of me.  And we just try to go get it done.",
        "13": "I think it's all about angles.  For me, seeing things before they happen, being able to beat a defender that's in front of me, but understanding there's going to be multiple guys either stabbing at the ball, rotating, poking at the ball, putting bodies and hands in front of me.  So you have to be strong with the ball, first of all.  Especially against the Golden State Warriors team that is so great with their hands, either from Steph, Draymond, obviously.  Iggy didn't play in Game 1, but in the past we know Iggy -- Shaun Livingston, and the rest go on.  They're so good with their hands that you have to be very strong with the ball.  So being able to read and react to the defense, being able to not only get past your guy but know when the rotations happen and being able to put the ball on time and on target to your teammates. There are a lot of things that go on.  I just try to read and react and know what's going on throughout the course of a game.  It may change from quarter to quarter.  Coaches make adjustments.  Players make adjustments on how to guard you.  And then you always have to be on your toes on seeing that throughout the course of a 48-minute game.",
        "14": "Well, they're damn good with him and they're damn good without him.  No matter offensively or defensively.  Listen they've had a two-time MVP sit out playoff games and they've won, all right.  They're good.  They're great, actually.  So let's not get too far on that.",
        "15": "I think it comes with growth.  I think it comes with understanding what matters and what doesn't matter in your life, in your personal life. For me, it took time.  I mean, obviously I came into the NBA before social media.  I don't know how many people were part of the league before social media that's in here.  But I see a few of you.  Got some gray-haired guys in here.  So you guys were definitely around then. You could hear criticism, but it took four or five people to finally get to you if the criticism happened.  Then as you get into the later years of the 2000s, the social media thing.  Everybody is excited about it.  Everybody is like, OK, just the touch of a finger you can pull something or see something.  Everybody's like, it's the greatest thing ever. Then if you're a celebrity, you realize it's actually really bad for you if you pay attention to it.  Like, if you really pay attention, there are people out there that really try to tear you down.  You have to realize that, one, you don't know who they are.  Two, they don't know what they're talking about.  Three, they've never stepped in your shoes or been in the light to understand what it means to have to perform or whatever the case may be. I guarantee that there are doctors and surgeons and cops and firefighters and people like that on social media and people are roasting them too.  As you get older, you realize I'm going to do what I do.  I put all my time into my craft.  I gave it all that I have, and I live with the results. You can't get involved in that.  I can only speak for me.  I've learned how to laugh at the memes that come through.  I've learned if it's someone that's trying to kill me in the fashion to laugh at that, too, because it's funny at times as well, and not take too much into it. I can't sit here and tell you how my teammates go about it, because at the end of the day we all go to our separate homes after practice and we go to our separate rooms when we're on the road.  So I don't know how much scrolling goes on. But if I have some words of advice, if you're a part of it and it bothers you, then you probably should just delete it off your phone.  That would be if it bothers you. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "Now that you've had some time to reflect on the call and you're not in the moment, what is your reaction to the change from the charge to the block?",
        "1": "Obviously in the moment there was an expression of frustration with JR the way the game ended.  What can be said now that you have to move past Game 1 and lift him up to get that play out of his mind?",
        "2": "Did he say anything to you guys?",
        "3": "First off, how is your eye doing?  Kind of what happened on that play?  The second question, for the players that haven't been in the NBA Finals or your teammates that haven't been in the NBA Finals before, what is your message to them after such a tough Game 1 loss?",
        "4": "The referees' pool report they said they had doubt as to whether you were in the restricted area and that's why it was reviewed.  Did you think you were close to the restricted area, number one?  And number two, how many times have you seen, when they go to review, reverse that kind of call?",
        "5": "You have a long track record of bringing your A-game to the NBA Finals.  I mean, this is your eighth year, you scored 51 points.  What contributions from your teammates do you think really brought your game to the next level?",
        "6": "As the officials huddle on that call, are you guys being told what they're even reviewing?  Did you have any idea of what it was that could trigger it, or did you know that's what they were going through?",
        "7": "How tough is it like mentally for you?  I mean, you shot so well today, you were 19 for 32, you had 51, to recover in just a couple days and get ready for Game 2 after working so hard and playing -- your team playing so well today and just not coming out on top?",
        "8": "What in your view kind of happened late with Steph and Klay after your block, and then after that with the Livingston and Tristan Thompson stuff?",
        "9": "I know there will be adjustments, but do you take any consolation when it seemed like you had a good plan, the young guys seemed to handle the moment?  Do you take any consolation in that?",
        "10": "Would you say that this is probably the most frustrated or disappointed you've been coming off a Finals game knowing that you were right there and you had many opportunities to end?  Is this probably more frustrated than you've been after a loss?",
        "11": "From listening to everybody's reaction to the play at the end with JR getting the rebound, there is still confusion whether JR thought the game was tied or whether he thought you guys were ahead.  From where you stood on the court and from talking to him after the play, what's your reaction to it?  What is your version?",
        "12": "Well, did he think the game was tied or did he think you guys had it salted away?",
        "13": "Did you discuss it at all with him at the end of the play?",
        "14": "I was just trying to see if you knew exactly what his state of mind was.  Did he think that you guys had it won, or did you think he was trying to make a play?",
        "15": "What do you mean?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I thought I read that play just as well as I read any play in my career, defensively.  I seen the drive, I was outside the charge line, I stepped in, took the contact.  It's a huge play.  It's a huge play.",
        "1": "We got to move on.  This game is over and done with.  We had opportunities.  I would never give up on JR.  That's not my MO.  I don't give up on any of my players, any of my teammates, so I don't think that even needs to be said.",
        "2": "No, he didn't.",
        "3": "My eye's been better.  It's pretty much blurry, and it kind of got worse and worse as the game went on, after I drove and Draymond poked me right square in the eye.  So I'll deal with that over the next couple days. I don't think a message needs to be said.  We're in the fight now.  The Finals have started, and they've got a great taste of it tonight.  They know what to expect when we play again.",
        "4": "Like I said, I read that play just as well as I've read any play in my career, maybe in my life.  I seen the play happening.  I knew I was outside the charge line, and I knew I took the hit.  I don't know what else to say.",
        "5": "I just try to do whatever it takes to help our team win and try to be a triple threat out on the floor offensively and being able to score, rebound, and get my guys involved.  So I just tried to do that tonight.",
        "6": "No, we were told they were reviewing if I had my feet outside the line.  And when I knew that, I was like, okay, that's going to be our ball.  I knew I was outside the charge line, so that's what the communication was to us.  We were over on the sideline, drawing up a play, you know, to try to execute, try to go up a couple possessions.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, we take this one.  We understand how difficult and how challenging this task is.  You take it all the way throughout the night thinking about it and ways you could have been better and plays that could have happened that could have gone your way and didn't go your way or things you could have done, and you wake up tomorrow with a fresh mind and you move forward.",
        "8": "I don't know.",
        "9": "I do not.  I do not.",
        "10": "Because it's right now, I would say yeah.  I always live in the present.  I don't know how frustrated I was after a loss in the past.  I think we played as well as -- tonight we played as well as we've played all postseason, and we gave ourselves a chance possession after possession after possession.  There were just some plays that were kind of taken away from us.  Simple as that.",
        "11": "What do you mean what's my version?",
        "12": "How do I know that?",
        "13": "No, they asked me if I talked to JR about it.  I said no already.  I knew it was a tie game.  We were down 1.  George Hill went up, he made the first one.  We got the offensive rebound, you know, I thought we were all aware of what was going on.  That's my view.  So I don't know what JR was thinking.  I don't know the question you're trying to ask.",
        "14": "No.",
        "15": "No, I don't know his state of mind. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "What's the last couple of days for you been like, just as you go through the process of resetting the body and the mind?  And kind of along those lines, I know that the numbers that you put up so far in these playoffs, everyone's just sort of been gaga over them.  But do you think there's still another level that you can get to in this series?",
        "1": "You have four teammates who once played against you deep into the playoffs previously, Kyle Korver, George Hill, Kendrick Perkins and Jeff Green.  Did you ever envision playing on the same team as those guys at some point?  Did you want to?  And the last part of that, what do you like about having Perk around?",
        "2": "Is it good for the NBA to have the same two teams in The Finals four years in a row?",
        "3": "I mean, your thoughts?",
        "4": "Well, there's been some blow-back, some talk on social media that people are sick of the same match-up.  Do you feel like it would be better if there was more parity in the league?",
        "5": "Andre Iguodala, obviously he's out.  What has he done so well on you, or what have you noticed him doing on defense against you the last few years that's kind of making you take notice?",
        "6": "We appreciate it.",
        "7": "Thursday's going to be the 101st game you've played in this regular season plus the postseason, the most you've ever done in that span of time.  We've tried to get you to kind of reflect on it before; I don't know if you will now.  But are you redefining what a prime is considered?  I mean, in basketball circles for years, you hit seven or eight seasons in, 27 years old, that was kind of the traditional prime.  But now you're 15 years in at age 33 and about to play more basketball than you've ever played.",
        "8": "It was Cassidy Hubbarth.",
        "9": "Does that feeling still apply, even with Larry Nance falling into your leg and playing 94 minutes to close out Games 6 and 7?",
        "10": "A few years back you used to talk about certain teams or certain players having CliffsNotes.  There will probably be CliffsNotes when your career is said and done in your possible book or whatnot, with the Warriors time, tenure.  How impactful and meaningful is this series and rivalry with you in your career?  How do you view them?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I really think that's to be seen.  But for the last couple days, obviously, we were able to finish our series off on Sunday in Boston.  Monday was Memorial Day, so I got an opportunity to stay home with the family, barbecue, have a cookout, kids had a heck of a time.  I had a heck of a time just kind of relaxing and decompressing, until 9:00 Eastern Time.  Until I started watching the game and seeing who we were going to play. Just going against the Warriors in the last three years in The Finals, I kind of figured or thought that they could get it done.  Just because of the 18 of a possible 21 Finals games that I've played against them in the last three years, I figured out that they could make it happen.  Just their championship DNA. So yesterday, just round-the-clock treatment.  We had a workout before we left Cleveland.  I got treatment on the four-and-a-half-hour flight up here.  We did a little prep yesterday.  Got some more treatment, ate dinner.  I woke up this morning, worked out like I always do.  I got some more treatment and headed here to see you guys. The level that I can play at is to be seen, but the level that I put into the game and put into my craft is who I am.  So numbers and things like that kind of take care of itself.  But for me, I understand and I know how much I put into the game.  So everything else is OK.",
        "1": "When you go against guys, you can envision at times how they fit with you and what they could do for your team.  Going against Kyle, I always kind of was like, oh, wow, to add a sharpshooter like that to our ballclub would be an amazing thing.  Obviously our former GM, David Griffin, was able to pull that off and get him to us.  And the rest is history, what he's been able to do for our ballclub. I've always loved George Hill -- his length and his ability to put pressure on the defense, but also on the defensive side with his length.  I've always kind of seen that, obviously, with the battles that we had with Indiana and going deep into the playoffs. Me and Perk, we've been playing against each other and with each other since high school.  We played on a few AAU circuits together when we played actually for the Oakland Soldiers out here.  We played on the same team. Jeff Green, I never envisioned being a teammate of his.  But I've always kind of had aspirations for Jeff, especially when he went through the heart surgery.  To see the game be taken away from someone so young at that point in time, I was like, wow, this is a reset for me personally to kind of never take the game for granted, even though I never do.  But it gives you an opportunity to kind of think the situation that you're in. So it was always great to compete against Jeff, especially after he was able to get back on the floor.  Not actually knowing exactly what he went through, because none of us can actually know unless we've been through that, but you can be inspired by it.  So it's been great to have all four of them. To answer your last question, Perk's leadership, his championship, not only pride, but his championship manner, every day he just brings a championship guy around every single day.  Obviously, if you guys are out here, you hear from the Warriors all the time about what it means to be a championship person and to breathe and to talk and to speak that every single day. For a lot of our guys that kind of went on to other teams or are not a part of our team this year, it's great to have another championship guy in our locker room that can kind of give some of the guys that have never been a part of it some words of encouragement, or words of advice, or what it takes to breathe a championship mindset every single day.  So he's been instrumental to us since we got him back at the start of postseason.",
        "2": "You've got to ask Adam Silver.",
        "3": "What?",
        "4": "Teams have had their opportunities to beat the Cavs over the last four years, and teams have had the opportunities to beat the Warriors over the last four years.  If you want to see somebody else in the postseason, then you got to beat them.  Or in The Finals, in that case.",
        "5": "I think it's, first of all, he has very, very quick hands.  That doesn't get talked about a lot.  His ability to react to the ball either in the flight or while you're dribbling or while you pick the ball up. But at the end of the day, his athleticism allows him to play some of the premier perimeter players in our league.  He's a guy that's 6'8\", long wingspan, athletic.  He's been like that since he was at Arizona.  He's just added to his game every single season he's been in the NBA. I've played against him throughout my career, throughout his entire career since he got to the league.  A funny story, when he got drafted, we were one pick away from drafting him before Philly took him (with the ninth pick).  I believe, 8 or 9.  Then we selected Luke Jackson from Oregon.  I had loved him at Arizona and was hoping that he slid to us with that pick.  You guys like those stories, so that's why I gave it to you.",
        "6": "Yeah, you guys like stories like that (laughing).",
        "7": "Yeah, they always kind of talked about the NBA prime is like 27 and like 31, 32.  That's, if you're lucky, you'll get to that point. I don't know.  I've just never really bought into that.  I've never bought into a ceiling either.  You guys talked about what's your ceiling, and I've always kind of told you guys that I don't really have a ceiling.  I want to just try to maximize as much as I can and be as good as I can. I forgot -- I'm not quite sure who I did a postgame interview with after one of our games this year.  I don't know if it was maybe Doris (Burke) or -- it was one of the great lady sideline reporters that we have that asked me how do you feel and how are you still able to do this?  And I told her at that particular time, this is the best I've felt in my career.",
        "8": "OK, well, there it is.  I don't know if she believed me, and I don't know if you guys believe me, but I really felt that.  And I continue to just play at an all-time-level standard for the rest of this season.  Hopefully I can continue it in this Finals also. I've been blessed to be available.  That's what I take pride in more than anything, is being available to my teammates every single day. I think I've missed one or two practices a (year) because when you live in northeast Ohio and you have four seasons, you will get sick.  But I've been available for my teammates and been a leader to my teammates all year, and I've put in the work. It's allowed me to be able to tomorrow suit up for the 101st consecutive time.  If I'm fortunate, I can suit up for -- what is it, 108?  We'll see what happens.",
        "9": "I'm not going to answer that.",
        "10": "Listen, Golden State is one of the best teams I've ever played.  It's one of the best teams that's ever been assembled.  Then they added Kevin Durant.  So then what does that do to them?  It makes them even more dangerous and even more powerful and great. For me as a competitor, it's fun.  It's truly fun to know when I'm done playing the game of basketball to know that I played against some of the greatest teams that ever played, ever been assembled.  And this is one of them. You look at it, they've got four Hall of Famers on their team in Klay, Dray, Steph and K.D.  They've got a Finals MVP (Andre Iguodala) that comes off their bench.  They've got a number one draft pick, or I think -- what was Shaun Livingston?  One or two when he came out (fourth pick in 2004)?  Fought back, and he comes off their bench.  They've got an All-Star power forward in David West who comes off their bench. You know, it's just like whoever they kind of suit up or whoever they decide to be a part of what they've got going on over here is just a really, really high IQ basketball player and knows how to play the game of basketball. At what chapter will the LeBron versus Warriors fit into my book?  I have no idea.  That's for myself and whatever writer I decide to pick.  I know one of you guys would love to be (laughing).  Probably could make a lot of money. But I don't know.  I could sit here and say today -- listen, Golden State is a great team.  They're a great team, and it's not even -- I didn't even mention their head coach.  Their head coach is the one who kind of puts it all together, makes it all flow.  To be able to put egos and the right position and spot on the floor where everybody feels good about the outcome and things of that nature -- when it comes to team sports, that's something that you would hope that you could be a part of.  When you've got great guys that not only have great talent but also practice the way exactly how you're supposed to practice and then go in a game and play it that way. I've been fortunate enough to be a part of a few of those teams in my career, either from NBA teams or Olympic teams, obviously. I don't know.  I don't know where they will fall in my book, but they will have a nice chapter. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "Finals No. 9 and eight in a row, but we all know what this year has been like.  So how gratifying is this to get back, just given everything that you've been through?",
        "1": "I thought the 2012 game when you scored 48 against Boston was your signature game here.  Can you talk about where today fits in your competition against Boston?",
        "2": "That postgame moment you had with Al Horford, particularly Jayson Tatum, can you put that into words, and was anything said between you guys?",
        "3": "I know you said you're still processing this Finals trip, but the energy needed this season to get to this point, how would you compare it to other seasons where you've gotten to this point?",
        "4": "You've said late in the regular season that this has felt like five seasons in one.  You guys have been buried and resurrected and buried and resurrected.  Is there a lesson there to be gleaned where you guys sit now on the brink of the NBA Finals?",
        "5": "What does it say about Jeff Green, the way he rose to the occasion both in Game 6 and today?",
        "6": "Ty Lue said that negative Cavs news sells.  Talk about how frustrating it is that people constantly criticize your team over and over again?",
        "7": "Along the theme of what we've been talking about, there were some really bad losses this year and some bad moments and team meetings and everything else.  Was there ever a moment where you lose hope that this is not salvageable, and how do you not if you don't -- how do you keep the faith and keep the hope that you can pull this back together?",
        "8": "In a few days you're going to be playing one team that's really, really good.  People are going to say you guys are the underdogs.  What gives you the confidence that you can get this done this year?",
        "9": "At 35-23, what let you know, even though shots weren't falling for you and your teammates, that it was possible to get back in it and win the game?",
        "10": "With this streak, you've had a conference full of rivals that have been trying to catch and pass you and your teams.  Is there a cumulative satisfaction to knowing that whoever it is, however long they've tried, none of them have done it yet?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "To be honest, I haven't even really kind of processed it.  It was a great atmosphere tonight to be a part of that, be a part of another Game 7 on the road.  Those are things, like I said, when you're done playing the game, you can only dream and wish that you could be a part of that once again.  I haven't really processed the fact about going back to another Finals yet.  I know that's where we're headed.  I commend my teammates and my coaching staff and everybody that put the work in, even some of our staff that is not in the limelight, behind the scenes.  This was a complete team effort.",
        "1": "I don't know.  I just know it's the present, and that's what I'm all about.  I'm a guy who lives in the present.  For me, I just want to try to make plays tonight to help our ballclub win, to put myself in position, put my teammates in position to be successful.  We were able to do that.",
        "2": "There was a lot said, but more importantly, it was just a mutual respect and the competition.  Me and Al, we've had a lot of battles in the postseason and been on a lot of All-Star teams together.  I've always had a lot of mutual respect for Al and the way he conducts himself, not only as a player but as a professional, both on and off the floor.  That was the moment there. And then with Jayson, I just love everything about the kid -- the way he plays the game, his demeanor, where he comes from.  I know his parents.  I just know he's just built for stardom.  He's built for success.  And that's both on and off the floor.  Two guys right there that -- Boston is very lucky to have them.",
        "3": "It's what's been asked of me, and I have to be able to just try to figure it out.  I don't know how I can compare it to other seasons because I can only think about this one in the present.  It was asked of me tonight to play the whole game, and I just tried to figure out how I could get through it.  Throughout timeouts, I was able to catch my breath.  At halftime, I didn't come out and warm up.  That was my time to recalibrate and catch my wind again.  It's what's been asked of me from this ballclub.  I'm the leader of this team, and I'm going to give what I've got.  My teammates, they respect that.",
        "4": "Well, it's now six.  It was five, now it's six.  It's now six seasons in one.  I guess this is the last chapter for our team in this season.  It's been a whirlwind.  I mean, it's been Cedar Point.  Sorry for you guys that don't know much about Cedar Point, but it's been a roller coaster.  It's been good, it's been bad, it's been roses.  There have been thorns in the roses.  There's been everything that you can ask for. I've said this has been one of the most challenging seasons I've had.  But like I told you guys, you guys are around us every day, right before the break, right before the trade deadline, I kind of reset.  Didn't know if we were going to make trades or not.  Didn't know what we were going to do with our team. But I just kind of reset my mindset and said, OK, this is the season and let's try to make the most of it.  That's what's gotten me to this point, gotten our team to this point.",
        "5": "His number was called, and he just answered the call.  It's amazing.  Listen, at the end of the day, what he does on the basketball floor is extra credit.  This guy had open-heart surgery a few years ago.  The game was basically taken away from him, and they said it's possible you'll never play the game of basketball again.  The fact that he can put on a uniform every day and do the things that he does out on the floor -- I don't care if he makes a shot.  To make big plays like he made tonight -- for him personally, it's the cherry on top because the game was taken away from him.  So for him to be able to do what he did last game after Kev's injury and then obviously start tonight, it's big time.",
        "6": "I mean, I don't know because I don't really hear it.  I don't really get involved in it.  I kind of know the narrative throughout the season if we lose.  If we have a bad month, I already know what's going to happen on the outside world.  I've been a part of it.  If we win, I know the narrative.  I get it.  It's all a part of the storyline. But me personally, I don't really get involved in it.  I'm kind of over that at this point in my career.  But I think Coach Lue, he feeds off of it.  Some of our teammates kind of feed off of it, on just people counting us out and counting them out personally.  I think this tonight was another example of counting my guys out, saying they've been struggling, they won't play well on the road and whatever the case may be.  And counting my coach out.  I think they all rose to the occasion.",
        "7": "I mean, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.  I wouldn't tell you.  (Laughter.) That's a good question.  You tried to get me there, right?",
        "8": "At the end of the day, the game is won in between the lines, and we have an opportunity to play for a championship.  That's all that matters.  No matter what the storyline is going to be, no matter if we're picked to win or not, let's just go out and play ball.  We're going to have a great game plan.  We're going to try to get better throughout the series, and we'll see what happens.  For me, I don't know, I'm kind of like the wrong guy to ask because I just like to compete.  I have a love for the game.  I have a passion for the game, and everything else will take care of itself.",
        "9": "I think defensively we were just very, very sharp.  Very, very sharp.  We were flying around.  We were moving around and that continued to just keep us into the game.  Even with some of the plays that we made in the first half where we weren't knocking down shots, I always kept my confidence in my teammates and know that if we had the same opportunity in the second half they were going to knock them down.  And they did just that.",
        "10": "It's been a satisfaction in the fact that I like to be successful.  But more importantly, just the work that I put into it.  I mean, it's an every-single-day work ethic that I have while I'm playing this game, while I have the ability to play this game at this level.  I love the competition.  I think about the teams that I've played over this run and the players that I've played over this run, slightly.  But more importantly, me just being healthy.  I've been healthy throughout this run.  I put a lot of work into my body, into my craft.  Being available to my teammates and being available to my franchise, the two franchises I've been with, and throughout this run is what's been more important to me than anything.  Always being available. I'll be available for at least four more games.  And we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "How would you say your teammates responded with Kevin Love out?  How encouraged were you with that?",
        "1": "We didn't get a real good look at what happened to you.  I think you banged knees, and then how you were feeling after that?  I think you scored 12 points to close it out.",
        "2": "After that second long three in the fourth quarter, you kind of let out a scream and pounded your chest a little bit.  What caused that reaction, and what were you thinking in that moment?",
        "3": "We were talking in the '15 Finals when everyone was out with injuries and you said I can't play all 48 in The Finals because I burn too much energy.  You didn't play all 48, but it's pretty close.  With what you did in Game 7 against Indiana and tonight, have you exceeded stamina wise and energy wise what you are able to do on a court in a game like this?",
        "4": "Going back to the roll-up on Larry, does that at all compare to -- against Chicago when you rolled your ankle, I think Griff [David Griffin] said your ankle bone hit the floor and everyone thought you were done and you just retied your shoe and walked back out there.  Does tonight compare at all to that?  Was one worse than the other?",
        "5": "You've had all sorts of challenges to overcome in your career thus far, but you're going to go into Boston where they're 10-0 this postseason, Sunday, Game 7.  What's it like pondering that chance?  Tristan Thompson said in the locker room this is what you live for, a Game 7 at the Garden.",
        "6": "Can you kind of take us through the next 48 hours and how you're going to get yourself ready to be in Game 7 the way you were tonight?",
        "7": "You obviously have that extra gear when you know you absolutely have to win and you're exhausted.  What is the thought process?  What do you say to yourself?",
        "8": "Ty Lue said that he feels like after six games you guys have the blueprint going into Game 7.  What's it going to take to execute that on the road?",
        "9": "You've been a clutch player basically your whole career.  How do you feel you're evolved in the last few years in clutch situations, because it seems like especially the last few years when the going gets tough, you're always hitting.",
        "10": "Paulo from ESPN Brazil.",
        "11": "The last few years --",
        "12": "Especially.",
        "13": "Do you feel like you embraced the situation more today than maybe you did in the past?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think they responded exceptionally well.  Our second quarter, our guys that came off the bench -- Jordan [Clarkson], Jeff [Green], Kyle [Korver] and Larry [Nance Jr.] -- they just gave us a huge boost in that second quarter.  That's the reason why we outscored them by 16 in that second quarter.  It was just huge.  We needed it obviously more than ever tonight with the situation that we were in.",
        "1": "I didn't get a good look at it, either, or I would have been able to avoid it.  After the game, I didn't know who got me.  But after the game Larry asked me if I was I OK, so I'm guessing he was the culprit of it.  I just felt someone fall into my leg and my leg kind of went in. I felt some pain throughout my entire right side of my ankle into my leg.  I was just hoping for the best, obviously, because I've seen so many different injuries, and watching basketball with that type of injury, someone fall into one's leg standing straight up.  Luckily, I was able to finish the game.",
        "2": "The love of the game causes reactions like that.  Understanding the situation and understanding the moment that you're in.  It was just a feeling that you can't explain unless you've been a part of it.  That's all.",
        "3": "Just try to put myself in the best possible shape each and every year to be able to go for the long haul.  Now, obviously I get a minute, couple minutes here, per quarter, would be great, but it's not what our team is built on right now.  Our team is built on me being out on the floor to be able to make plays, not only for myself but make plays for others.  It's just the way we've been playing, and we've been succeeding with it.  I was able to play 46 minutes today.  I got my couple minutes, I guess.",
        "4": "Well, I wasn't coming out in either case.  Obviously, I would have had to literally have a real, real, really bad injury --  [Knocks on table]  I don't even know if this is ... that's not even wood; I'll find some on the way out -- to come off the floor with the opportunity we have to be able to force a Game 7.",
        "5": "Just go out, trust what you've built on all year.  For me, I don't put too much added pressure on myself.  I just go out and play my game.  It's a Game 7.  It's something that you wish you had when you're done playing, but more than that, it's just basketball for me.  I know what I'm capable of doing, and I'm going to trust everything I put into it.",
        "6": "As soon as I leave here, I'll start to prepare.  I'm going to get in the car and head back to Akron.  As soon as I get home, I'll start my treatment.  I'll do the same all day tomorrow from before we leave to go to Boston, and then once we get into Boston I'll do that as well.  Try to get as much sleep as I can with tonight and with tomorrow and even on Sunday before the game.  That's the best recovery that you can possibly get, is when you're sleeping.  It'll be around-the-clock treatment, and we'll see what happens.",
        "7": "I don't know.  I don't really talk to myself much, to be honest.  I don't talk to myself much.  I just go out and play.  I have a drive.  I have a love of the game.  I have a passion for the game, and while I have the opportunity to lace my shoes up and put a uniform on, then I try to go out and do my job to the best of my ability.  Does it always work out?  Obviously, no. I'm not undefeated in my career.  Does it always -- me playing great?  I haven't always played great in my career.  But I just always want to try to maximize when I'm on the floor, and I've been able to do that in my 15th year so far.",
        "8": "You've got to be poised.  You've got to be able to handle a punch or two.  And you've got to be able to combat that and be just as solid and just as aggressive on the offensive end.  We know it's challenging.  They're 10-0 on their home floor, and they've been very successful against us, obviously, at home.  But if you love challenges, then this is a great opportunity.",
        "9": "What's your name?",
        "10": "I appreciate you saying I've been clutch my whole career.  There's not many like you, I tell you.  (Laughter)  There's not many like you.  Either you're being very kind to me because it's National Wine Day or you know I love Brazil or I don't know what it is right now, but --",
        "11": "OK.",
        "12": "There we go. No, I guess just being -- first of all, my teammates and my coaching staff have given me the reins to take the shot or make the play late in games.  When you have that ability and when you have that confidence from your 14 teammates and then your coaching staff and then you put the work into it, it's just a matter of just trying to come through.  Like I said, I haven't always done it in my whole career, but I've never shied away from it.  That's either making a shot or making a play.  I was taught the game the right way ever since I ever started playing the game of basketball.  My first year ever playing little league basketball, we won a championship.  My coach at the banquet gave everybody an MVP trophy. Everybody.  And that right then, I knew that this is a team game.  It's not about one individual and how much one individual can do in order to win championships.  In order to win, you have to have a full team.  And that's what it brought it down to me. The second year  we won it again, and we all got MVP trophies again.  It's just been instilled in me since I was 9 years old, when I first started playing, of what it means to be in a situation where your teammates rely on you.  Just making the right play no matter if it's a shot or if it's a pass.  I've always just been taught that.",
        "13": "I've embraced a lot of situations as you grow up.  I think that's just all part of experience and things of that nature.  I mean, I love being a husband now.  Did I embrace that at 18, 19?  I don't think so.  I mean, I've never been around married couples.  As you get older, you just grow into more things.  I didn't love wine until I was 30 years old, and now every other post is about wine, National Wine Day.  So you learn and you grow and you know what's best for you as you get older.  That's just all of us.  I think that's what being a human being is.  You find ways that you feel like you can grow and what you like and what you dislike.  At 18, I don't think I'm the same player that I am today at 33, and I shouldn't be.  I don't think me personally I should be the same person that I was at 18.  I'm just much more seasoned.

      "questions": {
        "0": "Ty Lue was asked today if he felt you looked tired out there on the court, and he responded yes.  So my question is physically how did you feel out there today?",
        "1": "I asked Kevin [Love] if he could get a read on your team, and he wasn't sure.  Did you have a feel that you could match their intensity tonight coming into this game?",
        "2": "From your experiences, what's the hardest part about playing in an elimination game, and what do you guys need to do to make sure you come back to Boston for Game 7?",
        "3": "We of course have talked about this a lot over the course of the year, but you're facing elimination again, and so people are going to ask and talk about is this your last game in Cleveland.  But beyond that, your Finals streak is now on the line.  Do you go into that game now having to win two, thinking about trying to protect that Finals streak at all?",
        "4": "The home teams have played pretty well and the road teams have played not really well in this series.  Does that do anything to your confidence looking ahead knowing you'd have to win one here?",
        "5": "Confidence in your team.",
        "6": "What have you guys done as a team since the elimination game you faced in the first round against Indiana to now to better prepare yourselves to face this challenge?",
        "7": "The last couple games you seemed to have a clear understanding of how they were going to switch on you in the pick-and-roll and how you wanted to pick that apart.  They went big a lot more this game and mixed their coverages up a little differently.  Did it make it less predictable?",
        "8": "You have faced all the other Celtics playoff teams.  Would you say that this team is the toughest to date so far that you have faced?",
        "9": "You mentioned the fatigue thing earlier, but were you under the weather at all in this game?",
        "10": "I know you have a way that you measure turnovers if they're aggressive or bad turnovers.  Seven the other night and six tonight, that's an unusual high number for you.  How many of them are unforced and how many can you live with?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I had my moments.  But I think everybody at this point is tired or worn down or whatever the case may be.  Still trying to make plays to help our team win, put us in position to win.  We had moments.  We had an opportunity, but we didn't make enough plays.",
        "1": "Well, I think defensively we held them to 36 percent shooting.  I think turnovers was another thing.  We had 15 turnovers for 15 points.  But defensively we were in tune.  We gave up 96 points.  Offensively, we couldn't make.  We couldn't make.  We were 9-for-34 from the three-point line, missed seven free throws.  Obviously in the postseason, scoring 83 points, you're not going to win many games like that.  But defensively we gave ourselves a chance.  We stuck in the game.  Even in the fourth quarter we made a run and cut it down to 11.  At one point we had two opportunities to cut it to single digits and missed some really good looks, two three-pointers.  We couldn't make.  And if you don't make, it's going to come back to bite you.",
        "2": "We've got to defend like we did tonight.  We've got to make some shots; that definitely would help.  I think going back home, we have a comfort level.  A lot of our guys have a comfort level of being back home and playing off the fans and playing off our crowd, playing off that court, being more comfortable being back home for Game 6.  We look forward to having an opportunity to force a Game 7.  It's up to us to see if we can come back here for one more.",
        "3": "No, not at all, because I've never went to any season saying, OK, let's have a Finals streak.  It's just all about just win every game and it should put us in position to play for a championship.  I've been in championship mode since probably '09.  We weren't able to get there then. Obviously I made the move to Miami.  I was able to go there four straight.  And three straight since I've been back here.  It just happens because I've been able to play with some great players, play with some great teammates, coaching staffs that have been able to put us in position to go to The Finals.  I've never said, OK, this is my third one or let's try to take to a fourth.  It's just the way the game has been played and I've been able to be successful.  We have another opportunity on Friday to be as good as we can be, play Cavs basketball on our home floor and force a Game 7.",
        "4": "You're asking me or -- my confidence?",
        "5": "Well, for me I think I look forward to seeing us respond on Friday night.  I know how well we've played at home in this postseason.  That's the only thing I can worry about right now.  I'm not worried about a Game 7.  You have to worry about Game 6.  You can't put yourself in that moment until you take care of the present.  We're going to have another opportunity tomorrow to watch some film, go over some things that we can do better -- as we've done after every game in the postseason -- and see ways we can be even better for Game 6.",
        "6": "I don't know.  I have no idea.  You have your coaching staff prep you.  They put you in position.  They feel like this is the best for us to be as good as we can be as a ballclub, and it's up to us to go out and execute it.  Everybody is different.  I know how I prepare myself.  I know how I prepare going into each and every game, no matter if it's elimination or 0-0, whatever the case may be in a playoff game.  So I can speak for myself and know what my mindset will be on just trying to help us, like I said, do every facet of the game, to try to extend the series.  We'll see what happens.",
        "7": "No, I knew exactly what they were going to do tonight.  They switched it up a couple times with their defense as far as what they were doing with my pick-and-rolls when I was either setting or handling.  But at this point, it's not even really about X's and O's.  I've seen all the defenses that they can put out there, so nothing was surprising.",
        "8": "I'll speak in the present, and I think they're a very well-coached, well-balanced, hungry team.  They've got a bunch of young guys that were drafted very high and drafted very high for a reason, because they can do multiple things.  They can be aggressive offensively.  They can defend.  They can shoot.  They can put the ball on the floor.  They can make plays for themselves and for others.  I can speak for this moment right now.  I don't want to really talk about other previous teams I've played against.  I've played against a championship Boston Celtics team before, in '08, when they beat us in seven games.  But right now this is the present, and this team is really good.  Like I said, they're well-coached, they're well-balanced and we like the challenge.",
        "9": "No.  No.  I'm fine.  And I didn't mention the fatigue, either.  One of you guys did.  I'm fine.",
        "10": "I had two turnovers where I felt like they were really bad.  My first turnover, I saw something happening and Marcus Morris did a great job of reading it.  I threw it up ahead to Kev [Kevin Love], and he picked it off.  My second turnover, I went baseline, lost my footing on Marcus Morris, another turnover.  A couple of them, one in transition to Jeff Green, I thought I put it on his hands, and he kind of fumbled it.  Wish I could have that one back and maybe bounce pass that one. I had a backdoor one to Swish [J.R. Smith].  It hit his hands.  Maybe I should have not thrown that one.  It was a little bit in traffic.  Al Horford was right there, but it hit Swish's hands.  Maybe I should have taken that one back. I had a post-up on Terry Rozier that they doubled from the baseline.  Jayson Tatum got his hands on him and I had a guy wide open.  I should have faked high and thrown it low.  My last turnover was just very, very careless on Terry Rozier.  We had a pick-and-roll, I got the switch and I just lost it out of bounds away from their basket. So that's my six turnovers.  I think out of those six, maybe three of them were just careless.  I think the other three were attack turnovers, and I'm OK with that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "A lot is being made about all four games being won by the home team, but now looking back, what were you guys able to do or what did you change, what was different about you from the first two games out there to how you've played in these two?",
        "1": "You've talked a lot this year about being a new team with all the moving parts and whatnot, but most of the guys you guys are relying on have been there and four of you have won a championship.  Should you be ready for what you're going to see in Game 5, and what have you seen lately that would tell you that you are?",
        "2": "Oftentimes when we ask you about Kyle Korver, it's draining critical three-pointers.  But tonight to see him throwing his body around, chasing down balls, going out of bounds, what does that say about his level of commitment and urgency in the playoffs?",
        "3": "We talked about Larry Nance Jr. a little bit this morning.  What have you seen from his growth from postseason Game 1 to now, and how important do you feel like his third quarter stretch was at the end there?",
        "4": "You've probably seen every kind of defense in your career.  Is Boston, what they're trying to do, a familiar defense to you, and what kind of adjustments have you made the last two games when you're at about 60 plus percent in each one of them?",
        "5": "Tonight you passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in terms of most field goals made in playoff history.  What does it mean to you?",
        "6": "Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys were able to continuously utilize mismatches in your pick-and-roll sets and what it does for your offense as a whole when you get those looks?",
        "7": "You answered your first question before and you mentioned the defensive intensity.  How integral has Tristan [Thompson] been, tonight especially with Kevin [Love] getting into foul trouble, but over the last two games to kind of even up that score on the defensive end?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Obviously we were a lot better defensively, flying around and making them take contested shots and making them make the extra pass and still being able to fly around.  Our communication level has been up obviously in the last two games.  As loud as it is in the Garden, we've got to be able to transfer that energy and that communication into Game 5 in order for us to be better than we were in Game 1 and 2.",
        "1": "I mean, we don't know what we're going to see in Game 5.  Only the game gods know that.  We know it's going to be a hostile environment.  We know their fans are going to be very energetic.  But we have to just have our same mindset we had when we came home for these two games.  If our minds are there, we put ourselves in a position to be victorious.",
        "2": "I've loved Kyle ever since we made the trade to get him here.  I have no idea how Griff [David Griffin] was able to pull that off still to this day.  He's just a true professional.  There's not many of us '03 class guys still around.  I feel like we're just cut from a different cloth because we've been around for so long.  We have this work ethic and you see him every day putting in the work, putting his mind, his body into it.  It's not about his age.  I think it's just always keeping his body in the right position, especially in tonight's game. He's guarding -- how old is Jaylen Brown?  Can somebody help me?  21?  He's guarding Jaylen Brown, one of the most athletic wings we have in our league.  He's 21 years old.  Jaylen can fall on the ground 10 times and probably spring up and just as likely never feel it.  I don't remember Kyle falling too much like that.  I've got to keep his body as fresh as possible.  But listen, he's doing whatever it takes to try to help us win, with the blocks, with the strips.  Obviously his shot making is very key for our team as well, but it's just the intangibles he's doing for us defensively that has put him in a position to be on the floor.",
        "3": "Like you guys always hear me preach about, the best teacher in life is experience.  From Game 1 in Indy until now, the experience, the atmosphere, he understands what the postseason is all about now.  The more and more time he gets, no matter if it's the 10 minutes he got tonight or if it's the extended time in Game 3, he continues to play good ball for us.  That's key for our team, and it's key for him as well as he continues to grow.",
        "4": "Yeah, there's not a defense that I have not seen.  There's only so many that you can actually provide on the basketball floor, and I've seen them all.  Pretty much through when I started to play high school until now, so I've seen them all.  But they do a really good job with their communication, trying to force you to do things that you -- try to not do so well or kind of second-guess yourself.  For me, that's why I put in the work in between days and try to work on my game to where I don't -- you can't force me to do something I don't want to do or I don't have too much of a weakness.  I work on every aspect of my game.  But more importantly, my teammates are putting me in position and wanting me to be in attack mode and trusting me to put our guys in position to be successful. It's not about me.  It's about the collective group, and I'm one of the byproducts of that.",
        "5": "I don't know.  Listen, any time I'm in the same breath with the greats, I know you guys hear me say it over and over, it's just humbling.  To know where I come from, you guys know a little bit of the story.  But you guys don't know the full story about where I come from and the struggle that I had.  You guys know about the single-parent struggle, and y'all done heard that story.  But there's a lot more to it, which I'll talk about when I'm done playing ball. But to know where I come from, small city 35 miles south of here, and to hear I'm in the same category or talked about and jumping these greats in the playoffs -- it's like I was a kid and I watched the playoffs so much and I was like, I would love to be a part of that, that moment, that atmosphere.  I think it's pretty cool.  You hear the scoring, the field goals made, and for a kid that really doesn't care much about scoring.",
        "6": "I'm just watching them, breaking down film and seeing what's the best possible chance for us to be successful versus their defense.  I think this league is all predicated on trying to find mismatches.  That's every team.  If you look at the four teams in the postseason now, Houston is trying to find mismatches, Golden State is trying to find mismatches, Boston, and us as well.  We're all trying to find mismatches for us to try to be successful offensively.  It's not much of a secret.  You just try to execute once you get the mismatch or you feel like you have a position where you can be successful offensively.  Then you try to execute or just try to get a bucket.  We've been very successful in the last two games with doing that.  Boston was very successful the first two games with doing that.",
        "7": "Tristan has been everything for our defense since he got back into the rotation, got back into the starting lineup.  He's just been who who I've grown to know over the last four years.  Just always taking the one-on-one challenge.  Just having this meanness and toughness about him, not only offensively but more importantly defensively versus anybody.  He will guard anybody.  That's not saying that they won't score on him, but he will always take the challenge.  He won't shy away from any competition.  He's been great in the postseason.  It's not even these last two games, but in the postseason in general. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

And then if you'd indulge me, the left-handed pass you had to Larry Nance Jr., in the lane, the left-handed pass to Tristan Thompson in the lane and the time you drove baseline and wrapped around Tristan, can you rank those three? Le",

        "9": "LeBron, a very efficient scoring right for you, 27 points on just 12 shots, but what a healthy boxscore, and how related are those two functions:  You only taking 12 shots and seeing everybody else just kind of flourish and everybody scoring the ball?  And Kevin, could you speak to his ability to facilitate that coming forth of the whole team, and how dangerous a team are you when it looks like tonight? Le"

        "2": "Just tried to put myself in position to help our team.  I think tonight as a group, even when things broke down, we just covered for one another.  We made them make extra passes.  We made them make extra dribbles.  We were flying around, and I just happened to be one of the guys on the floor that wanted to fly around as well.",

It was something I kind of just knew I had when I first started playing the game of basketball, to be able to see things develop before they actually developed.  Then it was on me to kind of put the ball on time, on target to my teammates ever since I was a kid, and I started playing at age 9. To rate those -- first of all, with Tristan and Larry, being able to set the screen and get the man off my body for me to create some separation.  The first left-handed pass to Larry, I was able to keep my defender on my back for a little bit.  I saw their bigs step up just a little bit, and me having the ball in my left hand, I could pass with either hand so I was able to kind of shuffle a bounce pass to him for him to dunk it. The second one to Tristan was going right.  Tristan set a great screen, and Marcus [Morris] tried to steal for the ball so I was able to go behind my back to the left-hand side and then I saw [Aron] Baynes step out onto the floor so I was able to wrap that around him to Tristan. And then on the third one, I rejected a screen-and-roll and Baynes stepped up again.  I saw Marcus trailing me a little bit, so I saw I had the wrap-around pass because the other defender on the weak side didn't pull in on Tristan.  I don't know.  Seemed easy, right?",
        "6": "They're all pretty difficult.  Don't try it at home.  (Laughter).",
        "7": "It's very important for our guards to be aggressive.  No matter if they are making shots or not, we want them to be aggressive.  It just keeps the defense at bay.  It allows me and Kevin to have more open lanes as well when those guys are being aggressive, looking for their shots.  You saw that in G-Hill's mindset to start the game.  He just had an aggressive mindset that if they're going to slide under his pick-and-rolls, he's going to shoot it.  He gets a swing-swing, he's going to shoot it.  He's going to attack.  And the same for J.R.  We always sit up here and talk about how much pressure me and Kev try to take off our teammates.  Those guys took pressure off us tonight.  Their aggression just settled us in and allowed us to play free as well.",
        "9": "Well, I think if you look at any boxscore throughout the postseason or throughout the regular season, if you're able to get four, five, six guys in double figures, most of the time that team is going to win.  You look at the shot chart -- me with 12 and Kev with 12; G-Hill with 11 and even Jordan [Clarkson], his 18 minutes throwing up 11 attempts as well is just well-balanced.  Obviously every game doesn't work out that way.  We can sit up here and say why doesn't it happen like that every game, but it's just not how the game works every game.  But tonight was good ingredients of that for us to be able to get everybody involved.  Even Kyle [Korver], his shots in the second half, J.R.'s shots, everybody felt in good rhythm.  It's my job when everybody is in a good rhythm to just make sure I get the ball exactly where my guys need it, where all they can think about is just shooting it and just trying to put it on time on target."

        "0": "I felt like I needed to go back to the locker room, which I did, and kind of recalibrate.  It was a tough blow.  Obviously incidental.  His shoulder hit me right square in my jaw.  Just wanted to go back to the back and make sure everything was fine. But I don't think it -- it didn't affect my game after that.",
        "1": "No, I don't think so.  I think that's easy to say.  I think we had some good looks.  We had an opportunity.  It was a two-possession game.  We were down six.  We had a great trap in the corner on Jaylen Brown, and I felt like we played great defense and a foul was called on Al Horford, he goes and makes two, we don't score, and it kind of sends it back to a 10-point game after that.  Not as well as we would like to play in the second half.  It was a two-possession game at one point.  We had a great defensive sequence that ended up in a foul for them, so that didn't work out for us.",
        "2": "I think Marcus always makes plays at the right time.  His ability to play multiple positions, but they put the ball in his hands and they trust him to take plays for others.  He has a really uncanny ability to get into the lane and either creates for himself or create for others, and he did that tonight with the nine assists and also had some offensive rebounds and also some missed shots.  He's always been very productive for their ballclub.",
        "3": "With turnovers.  Turnovers and not defending full shot clock, especially in that third quarter.  We've had our third quarter woes this whole season, and tonight was another example of that.",
        "4": "We have an opportunity to go back home, protect home court.  We're going to use these days to really dive in on what needs to be done to help our ballclub be successful.  They did what they had to do, and that was protect home, and now it's our time to try to do that, as well.  We have a few days, like I said, and we're going to see what we're made of on Saturday.",
        "5": "I was checked for multiple things, and I passed them all.  That's why I was able to come back and finish the half.",
        "6": "How will I digest it?  I'm going to go home tonight and see my three kids, see my family, recalibrate, see my mom.  I think I'll be fine.  I'm not going to lose sleep over it.  You go out and when you lay everything on the line, at the end of the day, you can live with that.  I'll recalibrate as far as how I can help this team continue to be successful, how I can do some things to make us be even more complete, and I probably -- the only way I probably won't get no sleep tonight is if Kev [Love] don't get asked a question asked.  I'm going to lose a lot of sleep if someone doesn't ask him a question.  I'm leaving.  (Laughter).",
        "9": "I mean, it's the Playoffs, so we expected for it to be physical.  I wouldn't expect anything less.  I think we matched the physicality today.  We gave ourselves a pretty good chance with 36 minutes, and that 12 minutes in the third quarter, that killed us.  But as far as the physicality of the game, I think we was what we needed to be as far as that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "What did you think of the job -- I know he had a lot of help -- that Marcus Morris did guarding you?",
        "1": "LeBron, what did you see differently from the Celtics defensively that you maybe didn't see against the Pacers or the first round matchup, or the Raptors?",
        "2": "LeBron, speaking of history, this building has been the scene of some of your greatest playoff accomplishments and some disappointments along the way too.  Those Celtics teams were built much differently though, veteran teams, Hall of Famers.  How is this challenge different for you, and how are you different now than you were back then?",
        "3": "LeBron, you got started off 0-for-14 from three.  When you're having a game like that, do you think that you and your teammates can feel the misses going into the next shot, and what do you feel about three-point shots moving forward in this series for you guys as a team?",
        "4": "They had guys they were putting on you initially in any given possession, but you seemed to be able to get the switch to a different guy pretty quickly off that.  Do you think you exploited that switch enough to getting the secondary guy on you?",
        "5": "Do you come out of this one thinking the Cavs need to adjust?",
        "6": "But you were talking about how the three is part of your DNA.  You could change a lineup and go with a much different look.  You could have Tristan [Thompson] in the frontcourt, which would change matchups.  Did you see enough in one game to want to go in that direction, or do you stay with what got you here?",
        "7": "Al Horford made a couple plays in that early run for them.  How important was that to set the tone for this game?",
        "8": "The Celtics defense was more physical and aggressive at the point of attack tonight than they were in the regular season?  That something that surprised you guys when you were trying to get into your actions in the half court?",
        "9": "I'm saying they were, but I'm asking did that affect the way you guys executed your plays in the half-court?",
        "10": "LeBron, you guys were off practically a week.  Did you feel that you might have lost some of your rhythm as a result?  Was it kind of loose at the beginning of the game for you guys?",
        "11": "Start of the fourth, I think they cut it to 14.  Do you have any idea what -- I mean, I think they scored seven quick ones.  Any idea what happened there?",
        "12": "Not your first rodeo, down 1-0.  What is your level of concern at this stage?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I thought they had great game plan Game 1.  He was the start of it.  He was my matchup, and I think they did a great job of communicating throughout the whole game, knowing where I was and knowing where our teammates was. Brad and the coaching staff did a great job in Game 1.  You commend that.  We have an opportunity to look at a lot of film tomorrow, and see ways they were making us uncomfortable, making myself off balance and not have a rhythm all game.  So we'll be much better in Game 2.",
        "1": "No, I've seen every coverage, pretty much.  For me, Game 1 has always been a feel-out game for me, if you've ever followed my history.  So I've got a good sense of the way they played me today and how I'll play going into Game 2.",
        "2": "Every year is a different challenge, no matter if you're going against the previous Celtics team or the present.  They've always been well coached.  They've always had multiple guys on the floor that can do multiple things, and they've always had two-way players. That challenge has never -- it's not like it's been different.  It's always been that same challenge.  So for me as an individual I just try to get better every year to put myself in a position where I can be successful.",
        "3": "Well, I mean, three-point shots is a part of our DNA.  It's what makes us the best team that we can be.  I think even early on with the shots that we had, we had some wide-open looks that just didn't go.  I think in the first quarter, J.R. [Smith] and Kev [Kevin Love], G. Hill [George Hill], they had some great looks, they just didn't go.  We're okay with that.  We're absolutely okay with that.  And we're going to take those same looks going into Game 2 if the opportunity presents itself.",
        "4": "Well, like I said, I'm going to get the opportunity to break down the film tonight and tomorrow and see ways that we can be better to offensively have a much better rhythm.",
        "5": "Well, I mean, you definitely have to adjust.  That's what part of the playoff series is about.  The teams adjusting from game to game and seeing ways you can be better.  I think that's an obvious question.",
        "6": "Well, I mean, you're asking a tactical question as far as something I can't control.  That would be a Coach [Tyronn] Lue question if he wants to change the lineup or not.  I think our coaching staff will give us the best game plan to go out and win, no matter who is in the starting lineup going into Game 2. The three-point shot has been a big part since we pretty much assembled this team four years ago, and I think it's going to be a big part of it throughout the series, as long as we continue to get the ball moving and guys feel in good rhythm.",
        "7": "I think it started from their momentum and what they wanted to do started from the tip ball.  Horford tipped it right to Jaylen Brown and it looked like we had two on them, and next thing you know he's getting a lay-up right off the tip.  So that kind of set the tone right there. We missed some shots, they made some shots.  Horford hit a big three and also was able to get an and one and get Kev his early two quick fouls.  So it kind of just started from the beginning.",
        "8": "What do you mean?  Are you asking me were they more physical or are you saying?",
        "9": "No, physical basketball is part of playoffs.  That's what you expect.  I don't think you can just say that because you're not on the floor, but physical basketball is part of the postseason.  So it's easy to make a narrative when you win or lose to say, okay, you guys played bad offensively and you lost, and then you win, and it's like, oh, you played better. So physical basketball started from Game 1 in the Indiana series when Indiana punched us in the mouth too in Game 1, and it's been like that throughout.",
        "10": "I don't think so.  I thought offensively we got to where we wanted to get to, but they also shut off a few things that they wanted to do as well.  But I don't think it was a rhythm thing.  We had some really good looks.  We had been off before in previous years when we had weeks and week and a half.  So that has nothing to do with it. At the end of the day you play the game when the schedule comes out and you get ready to go.",
        "11": "What happened?  We ran them -- the first possession we ran them down all the way to two on the shot clock.  Marcus Morris missed the jumpshot, fouled it up, they got a dunk.  We came back down, we ran a set for Jordan Clarkson, and he came off and missed it.  They rebounded it, and we came back on the defensive end and we got a stop.  They took it out on the sideline.  Jayson Tatum took the ball out, through it to Marcus Morris in the short corner, he made a three.  We come back down, missed another shot.  Then Tatum came down and went 94 feet, did a Euro step and made a right-hand lay-up, timeout.  There you go.",
        "12": "I have zero level of concern at this stage.  I didn't go to college, so it's not March Madness.  You know, you get better throughout the series.  You see ways you can get better throughout the series.  But I've been down 0-1, I've been down 0-2.  I've been down before in the postseason.  But for me, there's never no level of concern no matter how bad I played tonight with seven turnovers, how inefficient I was shooting the ball. I'm just as confident going into a series whether it's a 0-0 series or I'm down 0-1.  So we have another opportunity to be better as a ball club coming in Tuesday night, and we'll see what happens.

      "questions": {
        "0": "We've been talking since the press conferences began about how much more effort and energy was into tonight.  How much of that was changing up the format and having a Team LeBron and Team Steph?  Could you have done this if it was still East versus West?",
        "1": "When you look at the youngsters that's coming in today and it seems like people always want to push out the older guys, do you take that as a challenge now that you've got the MVP Award?  But do you take on the challenge of still playing at a high level?",
        "2": "The format is still evolving.  They said they might lean toward televising it next year, which I know you're supportive of.  They also said as of right now there is no rule against a player being a captain two years in a row.  The inclination is if the fans want you to be captain again or Steph to be captain, they'll let you do it again.  Is it something you want to do again?",
        "3": "LeBron, that step-back three from the left wing seems to be something in your bag that you're going to late in games with more regularity.  What is the origin of the shot?  Any player you played with before give you any inspiration on it?",
        "4": "What are your thoughts on playing with Kyrie again, what was that like, and were you able to fall back into old habits and run any old sets you were able to run previously?",
        "5": "Can you now divulge what your draft process was, your starting five?  Can you now let us know who it was?",
        "6": "Did you have fun with the GM process, and what advice did you get?  Did you get some advice from your boys?",
        "7": "Where did you hide that draft board?  It wasn't in your locker room.  Where was it at?",
        "8": "When you look back on this weekend, what will stand out most to you about L.A. All-Star Weekend?",
        "9": "LeBron, you won MVP of this game in 2006.  To win again now, how is your approach to this game?  How much energy do you want to expend?  How has that evolved or not evolved over these years?",
        "10": "No, that was the first one.",
        "11": "LeBron, congratulations.  Looking forward to the second half of the season, we know what your goal is.  What would a fourth championship mean to you personally?  What do you think a second championship would mean to the city of Cleveland?",
        "12": "Can you walk us through that play you guys had with about 30 seconds back to take the lead?  Dwane said it was set up initially but then you guys improvised the end?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, obviously, we don't know that.  We don't know.  But I think the format was great.  I think the fans did a great job of reacting to it in a very positive way. For me to be the captain of the team, Steph being the captain of his team and us doing that, that draft was something that hadn't been done before.  The great thing about our commissioner, he's absolutely okay with trying something new, to change the format, and it definitely worked out for everybody.  It worked out not only for the players, not only for the league, but for our fans, for everybody.  It was a great weekend, and we capped it off the right way.",
        "1": "Listen, I respect the younger guys, and I love them.  My boys love them.  They play with them in the video games.  When they see them they're always speaking to them.  They're the next crew, for sure.  They've got to keep this thing going. What I take pride in is taking care of my body.  Taking care of my body.  Making sure I'm available every night and continue to get better and better.  I don't really take it as a young guy, okay, I need to show him that I'm still able to do this.  I need to continue to show myself, you know, because every night I step on the floor I have to lead my guys or prove to myself that I'm still able to play at a high level.  I feel great.",
        "2": "I'm not against it, that's for sure.  I had a heck of a time doing it in the conference call with Steph.  We're going to try to figure out ways we can continue to get better and better.  But if we decided that, just like the coaches, you can't be a coach of a team no matter if your team is number one the East or the West every year, they offset it every year. So it would be great to see somebody else next year if they wanted to do that format or they wanted to keep it the same with the two top vote getters.  Either or works for me.  I've just got to play some good ball in the first half of the season next year to make sure I'm in Charlotte.",
        "3": "No, just something I kind of worked on in the summertime.  And in order to get better with something you work on in the summertime you've got to try to implement it in practice and implement it into the game.  Get more comfortable with it. So we had a chance to actually take the lead before that possession, and Paul kind of got blocked by Embiid.  Kyrie had a great tip-in.  Russ kind of got his hand on it.  We couldn't get that, we fouled DeMar and he only made one out of two.  So I've got Embiid on me, knowing that he's going to give me a little space and I'm going to create a little bit more space once I get to that step- back.  It just felt good when it left my hands.",
        "4": "It was phenomenal.  It was phenomenal.  Anytime you're able to get back and play with one of your old teammates, and as great as he is, we all know that.  The flashiness, the ball handling, the ability to shoot, it was just great to get back on the floor with him.  It was a great moment, for sure.",
        "5": "Yeah, I took Kevin first, then I took Anthony Davis, and I followed that with Kyrie and DeMarcus.",
        "6": "No, no, my boys didn't give me no advice.  But I know who they like to play with in the video games.  But I know who I like watching.  I know who I like watching and I had a draft board.  I had a process.  Some of it went to -- it almost went according to plan.  A couple of them fell through, but I was satisfied and happy with all the guys that I got. Even with the four guys that got injured we were able to get four new guys that came in and played well for us.",
        "7": "Ain't none of your business, you're going too far, man (laughing).",
        "8": "I think L.A. is a perfect place to host All-Star Weekend.  It's one of the few cities that we have in our league that can accommodate all of this.  And when I mean all of this, you have over 200-plus countries that's covering the game.  You've got so many people from all over the world coming to watch our game and just be a part of All-Star Weekend.  And we know the traffic.  We understand that.  But traffic is traffic and -- but L.A. can accommodate that.  It's built for stars.  It's built for entertainment.  It's built for cameras and bright lights, and it's a great place for it. I hope everybody had a great weekend.  I know I did.  I know my family did.  So it was a great weekend.",
        "9": "I don't know, the last one I won?",
        "10": "Oh, the first one.  I don't know.  I mean, I just always felt like I could be a part of this league and make a difference and make an impact.  From my very first All-Star up until now, I just try to get better and better and not only show myself but show my peers and show everybody that I belong.  It's always been my fans who voted me in.  For 14 straight years, my fans have voted me in as an All-Star starter, and it's been up to me to go out and let them know and show them, listen, I appreciate that and here's what I'm going to give to you every time you vote me in. So it's just a good time to be alive, I can tell you that, and play this game that I love, and also being able to have my family and my boys and my little girl, and to be able to see me doing what I'm doing at a high level right now and know what's going on.  So it's pretty cool.",
        "11": "Well, I mean, championships is what I play for, and along the way you're able to have -- if you're able to have some accolades along the journey, then it's really cool, and this is one of them.  We have a lot of work to do.  We just added four new guys before the break, and we have a lot of work to do. So I really don't like to think that too far ahead.  But obviously winning championships is what it's all about.  That's what this league is all about and hopefully at the end of the road then I have the Cavs there to actually compete for one, to be in a Finals representing the East. So that's my goal.  Getting back.  I'm looking forward to getting back to our guys.  I know they're excited, and that's going to be my mindset.  But we'll see what happens.",
        "12": "Yeah, it actually did.  I was taking the ball out, and then we had two crossers at the top to just get the defense moving.  Then we wanted to get it to Russ.  Russ being so dynamic in his ability to break down defenses, we wanted to get it to him.  Russ was able to make one move, they switched, and Russ kind of was left up in the air.  He was able to hit Kyrie on the baseline, and playing with Kyrie for so many games, you know, if I just make myself available, you know, we would find me. He found me and I was able to make the left-hand lay-up over Draymond.  So you have plays, but then sometimes you have to improvise when it breaks down, and we were able to do that.  That's the beauty of being on the floor with a bunch of All-Stars.  It doesn't always work that way, but when you have All-Stars with guys with high IQ and guys that want to play the game and play the game the right way, it works out for the best.

She won in that case because now I know who she is. For her to go up there and say what she said, first of all, I would have had a little more respect for her if she actually wrote those words.  She probably said it right off the teleprompter, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s OK. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back to everything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been talking about over the last few years.  It lets me know that everything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been saying has been correct, for her to have that type of reaction.  But we will definitely not shut up and dribble.  I will definitely not do that.  I mean too much to society.  I mean too much to the youth.  I meant too much to so many kids who feel like they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a way out and need someone to help lead them out of the situation theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in. Also, I wish she would have done a little more fact-checking, because I actually did finish high school and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave early.  I graduated high school. You know, to be an African-American kid and grow up in the inner city with a single parent, mother, and not being financially stable and to make it where I've made it today, I think I've defeated the odds. I want every kid to know that.  And I want everybody to know that the youth, they can do it as well.  That's why I would not just shut up and dribble, because I mean too much to my two boys here, their best friend right here, my daughter that's at home, my wife, my family and all these other kids that look up to me for inspiration who are trying to find a way out, finding some leeway on how they can become as great as they can be and how those dreams can become a reality. She did the best thing to help me create more awareness.  So I appreciate her for giving me even more awareness.  For me to sit up here in the greatest weekend of the NBA, All-Star weekend, this is the best weekend of the NBA, where all the countries in the whole entire world come watch the greatest players in the world, no matter if they're a part of Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  I get to sit up here and talk about social injustice, equality and why a woman on a certain network decided to tell me to shut up and dribble.  So, thank you, whatever her name is.  I don't even know her name.",
        "1": "Because there was a time where athletes either felt they shouldn't speak up upon things or they didn't feel the courage to speak about things that were going on. I've always said at the end of the day I do it because I'm passionate about it.  I do it because I know that this is bigger than just me personally. The hardest thing in the world for me personally is raising two African-American boys and an African-American daughter in today's society.  It's hard. For me to sit up here as an athlete -- that's why I started a company.  I started Uninterrupted because I wanted athletes to feel like they had the power.  They had the platform to speak about whatever they wanted to speak about and not have it cut and diced and split into a sound bite and people use it how they want to use it.  That's exactly why I started it. It can be as powerful as speaking about Trayvon Martin, or it could be as simple as saying what type of socks are you wearing this morning.  That's why I started the platform that I started, to have athletes feel empowered to speak about whatever they feel like they want to speak about. Because we have so many kids and so many people look up to us, to have that platform means everything to me.",
        "2": "I think ever since Jerry Colangelo and Coach K and Pop and those guys really took it seriously, we all started taking it very seriously.  Understanding that the state of our sport, of the USA Basketball and the NBA, wasn't where it should be. It started to become greater and greater and greater, and I give all the credit to Jerry Colangelo and Coach K, just understanding what we needed to go to, how we needed to get there.  They did a great job of that.",
        "3": "I think the skills that makes Joel special on the court are his ability to do a little bit of everything.  His ability to shoot, his ability to put the ball on the ground, his ability to use his footwork in the paint, his ability to be athletic as well. You saw him move last night.  He made a pump fake at the three-point line, drove right, spun and dunked it home.  There are not many guys with his size and his height to be able to put that type of footwork and that type of package together. Then off the court he's just being himself.  He is who he is.  That's special.  When you're authentic, I think people gravitate toward that.",
        "4": "If he was available, I was taking him.",
        "5": "Well, I mean, listen, anytime I get an opportunity to be with a fellow teammate of mine on the same court, and then you add on the fact of what we were able to accomplish in the three years, they just make it special.  You automatically start thinking about the moments. There was a time when I was in Miami when I thought about if there was a chance for me to be Kyrie's teammate at All-Star Weekend.  I thought about that.  I didn't think it would be possible, and then we became teammates.  We were on the same All-Star court together as teammates. Then, now, being opponents once again, but those thoughts still go into my head of how great it was to break the drought in our city, over 50-plus years, when the both of us had magical, magical Finals runs.  So it's always special.",
        "6": "Do I feel like her comments were racist?  Well, listen, race is a part of our country, and we know that.  I think the engine that she sits behind doesn't have a great rap sheet when it comes to race in our country and things of that nature. There's been many people that's not African-American that spoke upon the same issues that I spoke upon, and they didn't say anything to them.  So you can look at it as being racist or you could look at it saying it's just racial tension, which we already know that.  That goes without saying. I don't think we sit here and say, Oh, she's racist or that's racial tension, I'm surprised.  We know that was going on.  I'm just trying to shed a greater light and a positive light on the bad aura or the energy that some of the people are trying to give to the people of America and to the world. I'm not the negative side.  Me having this platform, I'm just trying to shed a positive light on what I feel like is right. Am I always right?  Can I have everybody follow me?  I don't think so.  But I'm looking at my boys right here, teaching them what's right and what's wrong, and we see what happens after that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "I know every season's different, every series is different, but two years ago you sat at your locker for 45 minutes with a towel over your head after the game ended.  Tonight you're in here already.  Can you go through your emotions in the moment and how -- it sounds silly, how this feels.",
        "1": "You guys are obviously competitors, you think you can overcome everything.  Was there ever a point in this series where you felt overmatched, like you weren't going to be able to do this?",
        "2": "32 years old, 14 years in the league, and now there's this team out West that has won two championships the last three years.  How do you view them when you look at what's your future in the league?",
        "3": "You said you have a sense of history about this.  You averaged a triple-double in The Finals, never been done before.  You referenced maybe the best.  Was this your best series you've ever played?",
        "4": "You mentioned all the energy you exert, and obviously you worked so hard.  What do you plan on doing to get away from the game for a little while, and how long before you recharge your batteries and get back at it?",
        "5": "Five years ago you broke through, got your first championship against Kevin Durant.  Having those burdens and those expectations to finally achieve it, I'm wondering if you could offer your perspective what you think it must be like for him, having experienced something like that yourself?",
        "6": "Obviously you can't control where free agents go and teams get stacked or whatnot.  How you would you look back at this season?  How can you assess this season?",
        "7": "Yes.",
        "8": "You just said I need to take some time and sit down and figure this thing out, big picture, Warriors, all of that.  Does it feel like the puzzle pieces are out there, you just can't see them yet?",
        "9": "You've been a part of two super teams, the one you have here, the one you had in Miami, looking at what the Golden State Warriors have done, are you still a fan of the concept?  Do you think it's a good thing for the NBA to build these teams how they brought in Kevin?  You get what I'm asking?",
        "10": "It was mentioned before that Kevin Durant lost his first NBA Finals when you won your first NBA Finals.  Kind of fast forwarding to right now, how is he a different player and a different person since you do know him personally, and even though you're -- obviously you're upset because you lost, how do you feel about him winning that first championship?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, for me personally, I left everything on the floor every game, all five games.  So for me personally I have nothing to be -- I have no reason to put my head down.  I have no reason to look back at what I could have done or what I shouldn't have done or what I could have done better for the team.  I left everything I had out on the floor every single game for five games in this Finals, and you come up short. So it would be the same if you feel like you wrote the best column of you your life and somebody picked another one over you.  That's -- how would you feel?  You know, so you wouldn't hold your head down, but you would be like, okay, it's just not my time. So Golden State is a worthy opponent, obviously been the best team in our league for the last three years, the best team this year, and they showcased that throughout the post-season, and we were another opponent in their way. It's just unfortunate for some of the guys on our team that's never been able to get this far and not be able to hold the trophy up.  And those are things that kind of bother me more than anything.  Guys like Kyle and Derrick and Deron and Kay and Edy.  So, emotions are all over the place right now.",
        "1": "No, I don't think I've ever -- not one time did I feel like we were overmatched until probably like I looked up, there was like a minute 20, and we were down 13, I believe, or something at that point.  And I was like, okay, we left everything on the floor, and it still wasn't enough. So that's -- they assembled a great team.  We were able to get them last year, and they went out and got one of the best players that this league has ever seen, so they did a good job of -- a great job, their front office and their players, by doing that recruiting, the things that they did in the summertime, and obviously it paid dividends.",
        "2": "Well, it's a two-sided question because for me personally -- I don't know.  I need to sit down and figure this thing out.  And so I don't know as far as me personally right now. But as far as that team, they're going to be here for a while.  They're going to be around for a while.  Pretty much all their guys are in their 20s.  Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don't show any signs of slowing down. So there's going to be a lot of teams that's trying to figure out ways to put personnel together to try and match that if they're able to actually face them in the Playoff series, both Eastern Conference and Western Conference.  Because they're built for -- from my eyes, they're built to last a few years.  So we'll see.",
        "3": "I don't know.  This is my 8th trip to the Finals, and I've had some pretty good ones in my day.  And like I said, I just try to do everything to just try to help this team win and more.  For me to go out there and for the guys that allowed me to be the leader that I am and allow me and trust me that I'm going to make the right plays and I'm going to do the right things and have the right intention, that's a compliment to a my guys, it's a compliment to the 14 guys that allow me to do at that and the coaching staff. And I just try to put in the work.  I put in the work individually, in the film room, in my mind, my body every single day to prepare myself for whatever obstacle that this ball club entails.  Does it always result in us winning?  No.  This is my third year here, and we haven't won every game.  We haven't won every Finals, obviously.  We lost two of them. So but like I've always told myself, if you feel like you put in the work and you leave it out on the floor, then you can always push forward and not look backwards.",
        "4": "I don't know.  I probably won't stop working out.  I think it's just a lifestyle for me.  So I probably will be back in my gym in the next couple days just because it's just who I am. As far as being back on the basketball court, I'm going to take a while.  I don't need to be back on the basketball court right now.  I need to get off of my feet and let my joints and let my body kind of recover from being out on the floor for 14 straight years. So but I'll train.  I'll train all summer.  It's just a part of who I am now, just a part of my lifestyle.",
        "5": "It's a great feeling.  When you're able to work hard, you're able to put in the work and accomplish a feat like that, it's something that we all dream about.  Growing up in our inner cities, a lot of hard work and through high school, through college, if you went to college, and through the NBA, you always hope that you will be in a position to be able to not only compete for a championship but win a championship, and it's a great feeling.",
        "6": "Our team, our ball club?",
        "7": "We had some good times.  We had some bad times.  We had some times where -- the biggest thing of this season is we weren't able to get healthy.  When we finally got healthy, the Playoffs was right around the corner.  And we showed what we're capable of doing when we got a full unit.  It would have been great to see us at a full unit throughout the whole season so we can continue to build and build the camaraderie and build the chemistry out on the floor so you don't have to wait until April to see what you're capable of doing. And, yes, we were able to hit the switch, but those games in January, those games in November, games that people think that's not important, they're important to me, and they would have been important to our ball club. But, whatever, we figured it out and got to the post-season as a two seed.  We controlled home court and were able to win on the road in the Eastern Conference Finals in Boston, and we were able to punch our clock into competing for a championship.  And as a ball club and as an individual, that's all you want, is an opportunity. Now, obviously, we ran against, like I said, a worthy opponent, one of the best Playoff teams that this league has ever seen, obviously, and we weren't able to get over the hump and accomplish what we ultimately wanted to do.  But it's no such thing as a failed season when you put in as much work as we have done individually and as a ball club since September.  Since late September.",
        "8": "Well, I don't know.  I'm not a -- I'm not the GM of the team.  I'm not in the front office, but I know our front office is going to continue to try to put our ball club, put our franchise in a position where we can compete for a championship year in and year out. Like I said, teams and franchises are going to be trying to figure out ways that they can put personnel together, the right group of guys together to be able to hopefully compete against this team.  They're assembled as good as you can assemble, and I played against some really, really good teams that was assembled perfectly, and they're right up there. So we will see, but I will get away from the game a little bit, probably watch some WNBA games, though.  Can't get away from it.  I'll probably watch -- my son's tournament is this summer, so I'll be a part of the game.  But as far as me actually playing, I won't.  I won't be a part of the game much this summer.",
        "9": "No, not really.  I don't believe I've played for a super team.  I don't believe in that.  I don't believe we're a super team here.  So, no, I don't really, I don't -- you guys want one more question before I leave and not see you guys for a long time?",
        "10": "Well, I'm not happy he won his first.  I'm not happy at all.  But at the end of the day from when I played him in the 2012 Finals to now, like I said, experience is the best teacher in life, and he's just experiencing and experiencing and experiencing.  And it also helps when you are able to experience some things with this team as well.  He felt like he needed to reassemble and reassess his career and come here. So like I said, having -- getting that first championship for me was like having my first son.  It was just a proud moment, something that you never, ever forget.  And at the end of the day, nobody can -- no matter what anybody says from now on in your career or whatever they say, they can never take away from you being a champion.  That's something that they are always going to speak about, about you.  It may be like the last thing they may say, but they are always going to have to say that you're a champion. Like I said, when you put in the work and things pay off, then you can always be okay with whatever else that happens in your career. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "After Game 3, you were talking about guys had to play A plus plus game to beat this team.  Do you feel like you played A plus plus game last game?",
        "1": "If you think back to 2012, the first time you and K.D. faced off in The Finals and what you see now, how different is he individually and how different is just the context of the kind of team he's playing with now versus what was obviously a pretty young Thunder team?",
        "2": "Are you guys on each other a lot more in this series than you would have been?  I assume you guys are on each other a lot more now?",
        "3": "Is it even possible to overstate how much more of a challenge it is playing a Game 5 in the NBA Finals when the other team has Draymond and K.D., unlike last year?",
        "4": "Game 4 aside, Stephen Curry's had a great Playoffs, great Finals.  What have you seen this year as compared to last year when he kind of struggled it seemed as the Playoffs went along?  How aware were you that he was struggling last year?",
        "5": "The last time you were right here, same situation, down 3-1, similar colors you were wearing last year as well.  Does anything come to your mind, like any memories come to your mind about that time at that juncture?",
        "6": "When Kyrie is going the way he has been the last couple games, how does that open up things for the rest of the offense?",
        "7": "What do you think of the job R.J. has done on K.D. in this series?  His minutes seem to be going up every night.  And what does that change for you defensively and how does that allow you to play defensively when R.J. takes Kevin?",
        "8": "You touched on earlier about turnovers and guarding the three-point line and all that.  The three games here this year have not been close.  You've lost all three by double figures, but obviously you won the two here in the Playoffs last year, so how much stock do you put in the first three games here in this building this season and how much do you rely on winning two playoff games here last year?",
        "9": "You told us The Finals are a stressful experience to go through.  Getting that one win under your belt, does that change the pressure at all?  Does it change kind of the mental makeup of your team going into Game 5?",
        "10": "The Warriors obviously just came through here and listening to them they sounded a lot like you guys after Game 1.  They just said over and over again about how poorly they felt they played.  Was that your takeaway at all from Game 4, that the Warriors were less than what they are, and what do you expect to see from them tomorrow night?",
        "11": "Do you feel like they feel like this is the game they have to get?",
        "12": "Did you guys feel like JR had to shoot more, he had to score more points to beat this team?  And have you passed the ball off the backboard to yourself before?",
        "13": "Back in the day people were shocked, I think [Tom] Heinsohn was maybe the first one to do it.",
        "14": "But nobody had seen it before.  They were laughing about it.",
        "15": "You said last week you thought the Warriors team coming together was good for basketball, the way that they have put their team together.  Do you have any sense, knowing the history of the game, that people are perceiving this differently for some reason?  Because there's always been great teams put together in NBA history?",
        "16": "They're adding three-on-three to the Olympics, and I just was hoping to get your quick thoughts on that and whether you would ever consider playing that and any other thoughts?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think we have to bring our best game every game against this team.  Like I said before, they create so many different problems out on the floor, so much firepower, that we always have to play great in order to win.  So we have to do that tomorrow night as well.",
        "1": "I think the difference is that they were just a younger team.  I think we had a little bit more experience.  Obviously we had a couple guys that had already won championships.  Derek Fisher maybe had been the only guy, or Perk [Kendrick Perkins].  So they had a couple guys that won championships too, but I think Russ [Westbrook] and K.D. and James [Harden] were just younger. I think, like I always tell you guys with my personal experience, experience is the best teacher.  Then you're able to align his experience that he's had over his career since 2012 with Steph, Klay, Draymond and this organization.  It excels your experience as well.  So that's definitely helped.",
        "2": "We have been on each other a lot throughout these first four games.  It's probably going to stay that way, especially tomorrow, and we'll see what happens after that.",
        "3": "It's the same challenges.  Especially being in this building.  We knew coming into the Game 5 last year if we don't protect the ball, we don't limit their three-point shooting, then we can get blown out the window and blown out of this arena. It's the same way.  If we don't protect the three-point line and if we turn the ball over, then we don't stand a chance.  So we know what our keys to victory is.  That's going to give us the best possible chance to go back home with a Game 6.  And if we don't stick to stick to that game plan, then we'll be going back home without a game.",
        "4": "It's never been my concern about who's been struggling or who's been playing well.  We have keys, and our keys is to limit certain guys.  You can't take away everything from great players, and Steph is one of those players.  You can't take away everything, just try to make it tough on them. Like I said the last years, the year before, the beginning of this series, you have to try to make it tough on him.  He's going to make shots.  He's going to make plays not only for himself but for his teammates.  Just try to make it tough on him, and you can live with the results.",
        "5": "No, not really.  It's different for me.  It's always been a different experiences and different challenges.  And for me it's just trying to get my mind focused on the game tomorrow.  Which I will.  We'll have a great practice today.  We'll go over some things that we need to do better in Game 5, and then it's just going out and play.  I put in the homework.  I've got my mind ready for these games.  I got my body prepared.  And if I leave everything out on the floor, then I'm happy with the results.",
        "6": "We love how aggressive Kyrie's been, and it's been great for our team, obviously, with his individual ability to make shots and to take big shots and to knock them down.  That's been key for our team.  And for the rest of us, we have to do everything else.  We have to defend, rebound, set screens for him.  We have to get him looks when he's got it going.  We have to set great screens for him to get him going and things of that nature.  So we hopefully can continue that tomorrow.",
        "7": "You have to give great scorers different looks.  If you give K.D. and Steph a steady diet of the same guy every single possession, then they're going to figure it out.  They are already great, so they're going to figure it out even more. So to be able to just put different bodies on K.D. -- myself, R.J., Swish [J.R. Smith] at times, Shump as well; the same with Steph, Kyrie and Swish and myself and Shump, and give him different looks, just to try to keep him off balance as much as you can.  But I think R.J.'s done a great job and he's just stuck to the game plan. K.D.'s obviously an exceptional offensive player, exceptional player, and he's going to make big shots.  He's going to take shots, but just got to try to make it tough on him and limit it as much as you can.",
        "8": "I don't put any on any regular-season game this year.  They're not the same team.  We don't prepare the same way.  I don't put anything on the regular-season game.  But we didn't play well in Game 1 or Game 2.  So we have watched the film, we see what we didn't do well.  And if you don't do something well, they will make you pay for it.  So we have to be 20 times better in this building, and we understand that.",
        "9": "Not for me.  The Playoffs is stressful and just the preparation, things of that nature, but that's just from how I prepare.  There's no added stress going on playing basketball.  Your coaching staff giving you a game plan, you just try to execute it.  There's no added stress of that. If you're able to get a win or get two, get three, get four, you don't win, I guess I've been a part of all of it.  I don't think you have more stress.  You know what you need to do.  If you're prepared, then you're prepared.  There's no reason to add more to it.",
        "10": "I just think we stick to our keys in Game 4.  We stuck to our keys.  That is all I can say.  I don't think they played poorly.  I think they came in with a game plan and we came in with a game plan and we happened to get that one.  I don't think we played poorly in Game 3.  But they just played better than us and they got that one.  So for us if we come in with our mindset of the game plan that our coaching staff will give us, we stick to it as close to 48 minutes as possible.  And does it give you a win?  No, but it gives us the best shot.",
        "11": "No, I feel like this is the game we got to get.  Or it's over with.  I think everybody's feeling that way.",
        "12": "Well, JR is a big piece of your offensive package and our defensive package.  We just feel like when he gets looks, he needs to take them.  And he's done that the last few games.  He's come up big for us offensively.  We have needed everything from him. I've passed the ball off the backboard to myself before and, yeah, I've done it before.  I don't have anything else to say about that.",
        "13": "Oh, that's a while ago.",
        "14": "That's good.",
        "15": "Well, I can see it from both sides.  Not going to exactly give you my opinion on how I can see it from both sides.  I will at some point in my career.  I'm not at that point right now because I know what I say kind of gets -- people take it the wrong way.  So I have my opinion on how people see it from both sides, and I have pretty good knowledge about it.  So a few years from now I'll tell you how I really feel about the whole situation. But they're a great team.  They're assembled as good as you can be as a professional team, and they're on a quest to win a championship.  You can respect that.",
        "16": "First of all, I think it's great for basketball.  For us to be able to add another category to the Olympics, another basketball category, I think it's pretty great.  I haven't seen the full layout of how they plan on executing it and are they going to use NBA guys are they going to use college guys.  I'm not quite sure. I'm not very good in a three-on-three thing.  I'm more of a five-on-five guy.  I stay out of the one-on-one matchups during our practice, the two-on-twos and the three-on-threes. So probably not.  I probably won't be a part of the three-on-three matchup that it has to offer. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "Just wondering if you could take us through kind of what was going through your head and how the play developed, the one where you went off the glass yourself.",
        "1": "The way you guys came out in that first quarter where Tristan is establishing the tone of the game, JR Smith is hitting some big threes, how can you ensure that you bring that same kind of mentality on the road in Oracle and just seeing what you guys were capable of, doing that?",
        "2": "The first three games you guys kind of struggled from beyond the arc, hit 24 tonight.  Just how different of a team are you guys when you're just knocking those perimeter shots down?",
        "3": "Did you talk with your teammates before the game and just stress like we're not going out like that, something along those lines?",
        "4": "How important is that, that everybody standing out for the game, and also do you finally feel that tonight you guys are who you are?",
        "5": "Kind of looks like dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  vu all over again, you guys going back west down 3-1.  Do you have these guys just where you want them?",
        "6": "40 more tonight for Kyrie, LeBron, coming off of the difficult end to Game 3, big performance from him, did you feel that he was going to be able to bounce back in a big way after that tough end to Game 3, and what else did you see from him tonight?",
        "7": "Whether it's adversity or desperation or intensity, this group, as we have seen it the last couple of years, seems to always respond to it.  What is in your guys' makeup that allows you to only have that really come out in these situations?",
        "8": "Physically, are you okay?  We saw you getting some treatment after the game.",
        "9": "Couple of years back, obviously, Andy was kind of that spark plug energy-wise.  How different is it now when Tristan can play the game that he was able to play tonight versus last three games, from just a collective team-wide energy standpoint?",
        "10": "He's a professional, but you've referred to him before as your little brother.  Have you had any talks with him over the last three games after any sort of frustration or struggles in regard to being ready for Game 4?",
        "11": "After Game 3 being such a letdown, did you have to work into believing that something like tonight was possible?  And if you did, when did you get to that point?",
        "12": "This game lasted almost three hours and you had a triple double.  This game had a little bit of everything.  Do you feel as emotionally and mentally drained as you did the last game when you guys lost?",
        "13": "The NBA life means a lot of traveling.  Do you have a particular routine on the plane?  How do you maximize your rest?",
        "14": "How did your approach to the game and your style of play evolve between the first Final you played in and this one?",
        "15": "Kyrie was in here and he said that he always is looking at social media.  He says he sees everything.  You've talked about a lot of times about how you're past that, you don't listen to critics and everything.  Do you talk to your teammates when all of this stuff is kind of floating around about curses and Cavs in seven tweets that kind of go viral on social media about kind of pushing that stuff away?",
        "16": "Tonight's game was so physical, and also dramatic.  How do you guys make it to focus on basketball and not to be distracted and especially keep the lead?",
        "17": "Just your reaction to that first quarter, first half, both record setting.  I mean, you came within a free throw of 50 for a quarter and 80 whatever it was at half.  Did you have a minute to think about what was going on?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think I was -- it was a transition play, and I believe it was Kyle on my right side that was running the wing, and two of their players were back and I was just trying to engage one of them so I could get Kyle a shot in the corner, and they both went to Kyle, I believe, and I got caught in the air.  So that's the only thing I could think of.  I didn't want to travel, and Draymond was kind of playing Double T, and Double T kind of had his back towards me, so I just threw it off the glass and went and got it.",
        "1": "Well, we're going to watch the film when we get to Golden State, and let's see ways we can be better.  We didn't play our type of game in Game 1 and Game 2.  And if we don't do that, if we play like we played in Game 1 and Game 2 of this series, the series is over.  So we have to continue to play how we played at home.  We have to be physically -- be physical at the point of attack, we got to continue to move the ball, share the ball.  And tonight we had 27 assists, and that's very key.",
        "2": "That's part of who we are.  We set a lot of records since we kind of assembled this team the last couple years.  And that's just part of who we are.  We got guys that can stretch the floor, make big shots, and they did it tonight, from Ky, Kevin, and Swish, and everybody else chipped in as well.",
        "3": "Well, I didn't hear it, but some of the other guys heard it and told me that that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker rooms, and I think it came from Draymond, which is okay, that's Dray anyway. But so I just told guys, I didn't stress anything besides just live in the moment.  Live in the moment.  We have a great opportunity to give ourself another opportunity to keep going.  We played well in Game 3, well enough to win, and we just didn't do it.  But tonight we came out and we stuck to the game plan our coaching staff put together and we -- this was as close to a 48-minute game we played in the post-season.  Even in the first couple first three rounds, this was close as -- to a 48-minute game as we played.  It was big for us.",
        "4": "Well, I think the last two games we have played Cavaliers basketball.  We have been physical, we haven't turned the ball over, and we have shared the ball.  In Game 3 we just -- down the stretch we couldn't make any shots, and they did.  And that was just -- it's a make-or-miss league at that point. So in the last couple games we have been playing Cavaliers basketball, and it's resulted in us just playing better and us getting this win tonight.",
        "5": "No, they got us where they want us.  Listen, at the end of the day, we want to just try to put ourself in position to play another game, and we did that tonight and hopefully we can do it Monday night where we can come back here. So our mindset is try to go up there and get one.  Which is probably one of the toughest environments we have in this league, along with our building.  And so we look forward to the challenge and the matchup.",
        "6": "He's just been very special in closeout games.  On both sides.  Us being able to close out a team trying to close out on us.  He's just been built for that moment.  I said that over and over again, that he's always been built for the biggest moments, and tonight he showed that once again.  It's not surprising.  He's just that special.",
        "7": "I don't know.  I don't like it. (Laughter.) It causes too much stress, man.  I'm stressed out.  Keep doing this every year.  But listen, at the end of the day we just got some resilient guys.  The Warriors have championship DNA, and we do as well.  We're battle tested, they're battle tested.  And getting swept is something that you never want to have happen.  Especially this point.  You get all the way to the Finals, you hate to get swept, lose two games on your home floor.  So I think a lot of guys had that in their mind today, and they came out and played like it.",
        "8": "I'll be all right on Monday.  I'll be all right on Monday.",
        "9": "He's a big piece of our puzzle.  We all know that.  He's been huge for our success the last three years, and they did a -- they have done a great job of putting him in the game plan and neutralizing what he does best, and that's offensive rebound and giving us extra possessions.  And it's been very tough on him in this Finals so far.  But he didn't get down on himself.  He came through when we needed him the most, and that was tonight, getting 10 rebounds and also dishing out five assists.  So that was big time.",
        "10": "Yeah, I have.  I'm not here to tell you guys what I've been talking to him about or what I -- but he knows what I expect out of him.  Like I said, tonight we needed him the most, and he was there.",
        "11": "No, I didn't have to work into believing it.  At the end of the day I had the same game day ritual.  And I slept great last night, came to shootaround, got my work in, I went home, took my usual pregame nap, got up, ate my pregame food, came to work. I didn't feel anything, actually, I was just excited about the moment.  It is what it is.  You come to work and you put in the work and you study the game for myself, and you just do everything to put yourself in a position to succeed. There's no reason to add any more pressure to it.  And I'm not saying it was the result of a win, because I've done the same thing for a long time now, but for myself, just being able to just stay even keeled no matter the situation, I think it's good for our ball club.",
        "12": "I'm about there.  I'm about there.  It lets me know that I did what I was supposed to do when I'm emotionally and physically drained at the end of a Finals game.  If I'm not, then I didn't do what I was supposed to do.  So that would be two games in a row where I felt like that, and now I got to get my mind ready once again.",
        "13": "Well, it's quite a long flight going out west, and so we try to get a little bit of sleep.  I try to get a little bit of sleep and then I get up and get treatment on the plane.  Just give my body as much treatment as I can on the plane and get a couple hours of rest.  Obviously it's going to be probably not too -- it won't be a long -- it won't be easy for me to sleep tonight because I'm still going on with the game and things of that nature, my body is not feeling as great, but I'll be fine tomorrow.",
        "14": "I stunk in the first Finals.  I don't stink anymore.",
        "15": "No, I don't see it.  So I can't talk to my teammates about it because I don't see it.  Unless one of the guys brings it to me, either as a joke or something they want me to see, but I don't -- it don't go -- I don't have notifications on my phone.  I don't have none of the apps on my phone right now so I can't even like click on it and accidentally click on it.  I don't get involved in that, man.  Because I'm like, I know, like I'm like every other mention when I play.  And I don't -- I don't like it because people just be talking like -- people talk crazy, man.  I'm going to leave it at that.  So I know better.",
        "16": "At the end of the day the game is supposed to be played physically.  Both teams were wanting to put themselves in the record books and put themselves in basketball history.  So try to do whatever it takes to win.  I think both teams definitely are trying to do that from game to game.",
        "17": "No.  You can't.  First of all, if you take a minute to see what's going on versus this team, they hit you with a 50-point quarter.  There's no -- you can't -- we were just playing in the moment.  We're just playing good basketball.  We were in attack mode, and it results in us having 49.  The reason we didn't hit 50 is because I can't shoot a free throw.  So, but I'll be better in Game 5. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "You spoke yesterday about going immediately home and getting the treatment because it was a physically and emotionally stressful game for you.  How are you feeling right now, and do you feel like the quick turnaround is an advantage for you to get back on the court or kind of a disadvantage because you need a little more rest?",
        "1": "One quick follow-up.  Obviously you guys played a lot better in Game 3.  Now that you had a little bit of time, what did you see out there on the court that's working for you guys and that you think you can bring and carry over to Game 4 to make sure you can complete out and get that game?",
        "2": "Having changed teams a couple times and knowing how hard it can be, how long it can take for it all to come together, can you appreciate for Kevin maybe, how fortunate maybe he is that it looks like he found a situation for him where it just blends perfectly right and maybe it can be quicker, he can find a fulfillment easier?",
        "3": "We know that you don't put too much importance on almost any one game outside of a Game 7, obviously, but would getting one tomorrow, how important would that be for you, whether it be to stop history, to avoid a sweep, whatever the case?",
        "4": "You touched on this a little bit last night, but even before this series you were -- kind of knew this was going to be a tough one.  Having played these guys now three games, is the challenge -- is it different than you anticipated?  What have you learned about the Golden State team?",
        "5": "After watching film now, that possession where after K.D. hit the three, were you comfortable with that?  Is that what you guys were looking for?  It seemed like a lot of time was wasted on that possession?",
        "6": "The plus-minus numbers last night with you on the court versus off the court were reflective of some of the numbers we saw throughout the regular season and also reflective of the team's record when you -- playing a game versus not playing a game.  Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals you missed some time, and the Cavs were able to stem the tide.  What can be done moving forward to empower this team to be able to perform at a consistent level when you're taking a break or from a game or from a brief rest in a game?",
        "7": "Ten years ago you began your Finals run against a team that was in the midst of a dynasty.  Now you're up against a team that looks like it's built to last.  Does that change the challenge, does that fuel you?  How do you feel about that?",
        "8": "I know you don't like to look too far down the road, but as well as you're playing and as good as you're feeling, have you kind of recalibrated how long you want to stay around?",
        "9": "Obviously you're no stranger to criticism, right?  There are some people that feel that with 50 seconds left in the game, you guys up two, they would like to see you kind of force more in those moments to try to score that basket yourself as opposed to dishing it away.  I'm just curious to know what your message to those critics would be.",
        "10": "If you could have the play over again, would you still make that same pass?",
        "11": "To your earlier point about K.D., when you changed teams and went to Miami, it was a different time.  In order to get a player of your caliber or Kevin's caliber, you had to pretty much clear the decks and start over.  Now you have a situation where a team is able to be a championship team already and add a player of Kevin's caliber.  Is that good or bad for the league in your opinion?  And for a guy who pours his heart and soul into this, is it fair?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Before I answer your question, I just want to send my condolences out to Todd Harris' family. Someone that meant a lot to our league.  I worked with him for so many years.  And that's very sad and dramatic, what happened.  Getting an opportunity to know his wife and his son and his daughter, seeing them all for the last few years.  Every time we played Brooklyn, I saw him in the tunnel taking pictures with the family.  Just always been kind to me. And when I heard the news -- I haven't been on social media for quite a while now; I didn't even know it happened until when we did the moment of silence yesterday before the game.  That lets you know that this is -- this game is unbelievable, but there are also things much bigger than that.  So my prayers from my family sent out to his family. To answer your question, I've been around the clock getting my body ready for tomorrow, getting my mind ready once again.  And is it an advantage?  I don't know if it's an advantage, after this series, after this postseason, after how many minutes and games I played in.  But I'll be ready to go tomorrow once the game gets here.",
        "1": "Well, I feel like if we come in with the same energy, same effort, physicality, as we did in Game 3, we give ourselves a good chance to win.  Now, does that result in a win?  It's to see.  Because we played well in Game 3, and they were able to get that one as well. So it was just about us playing the same way, being a little bit better down the stretch, obviously.  But like I said, last night we had some -- I mean, I just watched the film.  We had some pretty good looks that just didn't go down, and they had some looks that went down for them.  So obviously we know it's a big challenge, but we look forward to the matchup again.",
        "2": "Well, first of all, with all the success that he's gotten throughout his career, I've always been proud of him and I'm always excited to see him grow as a player.  I don't think that our careers are the same as far as changing teams.  Their team was already kind of put together, and you just implement a guy that's ready to sacrifice, a great talent, a guy that's willing to do whatever it takes to help the team win. But that team, they knew what they were about.  He just had to come in and just do what he had to do.  And that's what he been doing.  For me, when I left here to go to Miami, we had to build something.  We brought in eight or nine guys, and we had to build something.  And when I came back here, we built something again. But I can definitely appreciate the simple fact of him either reshaping his game or just sacrificing maybe some shots here, sacrificing having the ball in his hands all the time.  But it works for their team.  I mean, who wouldn't want to sacrifice playing on a Golden State team or a San Antonio team or a Cleveland team when you know the ultimate result is you can actually compete for a championship.",
        "3": "My mindset is to try to get every game.  Tomorrow's another important opportunity for us and for myself, obviously, to continue the series.  It's been a long season, and you hate for it to end this way.  So mentally and physically, I got to prepare myself for that.",
        "4": "Well, you knew they were resilient, for one.  I watched a lot of film on them, and I knew it was going to be one of the toughest challenges I've had because of the firepower they have, because of the mindset that they were going to have.  And they're a hungry group.  You can sense that.  You've seen that throughout the postseason.  You've seen it for the first three games of The Finals, and they have so much talent, a ton of talent.  And they work well together.  It's not one guy on that team that's selfishly looking for himself and not for the team. When you can combine talent, you can combine unselfishness, and then you can combine guys that play hard, that's going to result in some really good things.  I sensed that from not only watching the film before the series started but also now playing in the series.",
        "5": "Well, after K.D. hit the three, I think that's where Kyrie missed the jumper, right?  He had it going as far as the one-on-one matchup, and he's an exceptional one-on-one player. We take it.  We take it.  He was pretty down about the shot attempt that he got.  But, listen, like I said, it's a miss-or-make league, and he left everything on the floor.  He did everything he could.  And obviously when you miss the shot, you always are going to say, well, we could have got a better possession. But we live with that.  We live with our star point guard taking a shot that he's capable of making.  He just missed it, and that was the result of it.",
        "6": "I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that right now.  Obviously I hate the fact that we're not able to -- you know, just try to keep the leads, and if I come out of the game or not, even keep the leads, just sustain it.  I hate it for my teammates, I hate it for myself, I hate it for everybody that's involved.  And last night, it was another one of those instances.  I came out with 1:43 I believe in the first quarter, we were up 31-29, and then they went on a quick 10-0 run.  It's 39-31.  Well, 32 after they reviewed the three that added another point. And against a team like this, those type of runs you just can't afford.  And like you say, throughout the course of the regular season or throughout the course of the postseason, we just have to find better ways to, as a collective unit, having the right pieces out on the floor or the guys on the floor, they have to do their job, and try to do it at a high level, no matter who is out on the floor.  So something we have to figure out.",
        "7": "Well, I think it's just part of my calling to just go against teams in the midst of a dynasty.  This has been the best team in our league the last three years.  They won a championship, and last year it was the greatest regular-season team we had played, probably one of the best postseason teams that everybody's ever seen as well, but we were just able to overcome that.  And they're playing like one of the best teams once again. So like I said, there have been times throughout my career where I just played teams that were just in the midst of something that can last for a long time.  And obviously this team is built to be able to do that with the talent that they have. So we'll see what happens.  Obviously you never know what's going to happen, but as it stands right now, they look pretty good, as far as the future.",
        "8": "I don't know.  I don't know.  I feel good.  I actually feel better.  I don't feel good right now, but I feel pretty good where my game is right now.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  I haven't really thought about it, how long I want to stay around.  I definitely want to compete.  I want to compete for championships every year, and so we'll see what happens.",
        "9": "I don't know if you've been here for the last couple years or heard me talk.  I don't even really care.  I had a 101 drives last night.  I didn't have 101, but you get the gist of it.  I'm sorry I didn't go for 102.  But at the end of the day I don't really -- what is a critic?  It doesn't matter. One of my favorite quotes, when I really stopped caring about what people say, is Theodore Roosevelt, The Man in the Arena.  So if you read that, you'll see where I'm at right now in my life.  It doesn't matter to me.",
        "10": "If I could have the play over again, I would come off a three screen situation.  Draymond would switch on me with five fouls.  I would get him leaning.  I would drive left.  I would see K.D. step up.  I would see Stephen Curry drop on Kevin.  And I would see Kyle Korver in the corner, one of the greatest three-point shooters in this league's history, and give him an opportunity in the short corner.  I would do the same exact thing.",
        "11": "Oh, I mean, it's part of the rules.  The difference between my situation is -- well, the best thing with Golden State's situation is a lot of their guys are drafted.  They drafted a lot of their guys.  Three of their best players were already drafted, so they were able to hold on to them because they own the Bird rights, if everybody knows the CBA.  So they're able to keep Steph, Klay and Draymond and able to go out and sign someone else like they did this past summer by just getting rid of a couple pieces in Harrison Barnes and not re-signing Barbosa and Bogut and guys from last year's team.  So that allowed them to go do that. My case, going to Miami, we had to clear a lot of space because they didn't have anybody as far as guys that they wanted to keep as far as Bird rights besides U.D. [Udonis Haslem] and D-Wade.  They had the opportunity to go get two of us, and they did that in me and Bosh, and then we were able to finagle a way to get Mike Miller because some of us took pay cuts, and got some other guys.  We had Rio [Mario Chalmers] because he was drafted.  But it was a different situation.  Totally different.  Totally different. But is it fair?  I don't care.  I mean, I think it's great.  It's great for our league.  Right now, look at our TV ratings, look at the money our league is pouring in.  I mean, guys are loving the game, our fans love the game.  I mean, who am I to say if it's fair or not?  No matter who I'm going against, if I'm going against four Hall of Famers, like I said before the series started with Draymond, Klay, Steph, and K.D., or if I'm going against two or whatever the case may be, I'm always excited to play the game.  And I'm not one to judge and say if it's fair or not if guys are adding players to their team. So that's what you want to do.  Is it fair that the New York Yankees in the '90s was adding piece after piece after piece after piece?  I mean, if you have the opportunity to do that -- is it fair that the Cowboys added Deion Sanders? I mean, listen.  It happens.  It's sports.  You have an opportunity to sign one of the best players, and you can do it, go ahead and do it.  Why not?  If I become an owner, I'm going to try to sign everybody.  Appreciate it.

      "questions": {
        "0": "Obviously down 3-0, what's the message that you communicate to your team right now in what looks like a pretty perilous situation?",
        "1": "You guys were up six with 3:09 to go.  What stands out to you in the remaining three minutes after that?",
        "2": "Last year you guys did something that was never done before in the NBA Finals, coming back from 3-1.  Now you have an opportunity to do that again.  Does that give you some confidence, give the team some confidence that, hey, it was something last year that they thought was impossible, now obviously a lot of people are going to be like this is impossible?",
        "3": "Steve Kerr was saying after the game that he felt he kept telling his team, Kyrie and LeBron will get tired, they can't play one-on-one for 45 minutes.  Was fatigue in your mind a factor in the late game execution?",
        "4": "Also, can you talk about your mindset when Kevin came up the court with about 40 seconds left to go and he paused at the three-point line when you were defending him?",
        "5": "What were you looking to do in that situation?  What were you thinking he was going to do?",
        "6": "Did you guys -- throughout that game, were you convinced you were going to win it, or did you feel like you were in control of it?",
        "7": "I'm saying as the game went on, when you looked around, the shots you were making, the way your guys were playing?",
        "8": "You had 39-11-9 and Kyrie had 38 and 6.  Does that constitute as your best shot?  Did the Warriors take your best shot tonight?",
        "9": "They withstand that from you guys tonight, Game 2 they turn it over 20 times and still win.  I mean, can you wrap your head around what kind of team you're dealing with here in the Warriors?",
        "10": "Along those lines, LeBron, you have faced a lot of great teams in The Finals over the years.  When there's so little room for error against this team, how physically and emotionally draining is that on you?",
        "11": "Will you look back at the game and think if there is more minutes I do play, if there's more I can do?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, we didn't have any -- not many worries after the game.  I'll figure it out within the next 48 hours.  Obviously it's a dramatic situation to be in, but it is what it is and we got to get ready for Game 4. So we're going to come in tomorrow, watch some film, see ways we can get better and just try to take it one game at a time.",
        "1": "They made some shots and we didn't.  We had some really good looks.  We had some really good looks.  I had a turnaround jumper in the post fade-away, I make a ton, didn't go in.  Kyle had a corner three, really good look, right in front of their bench, didn't go in.  They came down and Steph, one ricocheted off the backboard, he got a tip in, K.D. got a pull-up on Tristan, and then he shoots a bomb in transition. So it's a miss-or-make league.  We make a couple, they miss a couple, and it's the other way around.  But it didn't happen that way.",
        "2": "Well, of course, but for me personally I don't get involved in what people talk about.  That's not -- I've been out of that department I told you guys for a long time now.  So mentally, me personally, I got to go home, start my treatment right now, get my mind focused and get my body focused and get my body ready for Game 4, and we take it one possession at a time.",
        "3": "No, only missed shots.  We missed shots.  I gave everything that I had, so at times throughout the game I was tired, but that's just because I was just playing as hard as I could.  But I was able to get second and third and fourth winds.  I don't contribute as losing this game because we got tired.  We missed some shots, and they made some.",
        "4": "What do you mean my mindset?",
        "5": "Well, I seen him getting ready to pull up, he uses a rhythm dribble to get a good look, and when K.D. shoots, he falls forward, and I wanted to get a contest.  The last thing I want to do is foul a jump shooter.  So I wanted to jump and contest it, but I know he -- when he shoots, he kind of leans forward a little bit.  So I just stayed there, high hands, contested, and he made it.",
        "6": "Of course we thought we was going to win.  That's just -- we had an opportunity.  They had opportunities as well.  And they made the most of them, and we didn't.  So, yeah, we came in the game believing we was going to win for sure.",
        "7": "We were playing good basketball.  Kyrie got it going, JR got it going as well, so we had some really good looks, like I said.  I can't go back and think of it right now exactly all the possessions that we had in the fourth quarter, but we had some good looks.",
        "8": "I mean, it's so hard to say, but like I said, for me personally, I gave everything I had tonight.  So win, lose, or draw, you live with the results.  Like I said, they played a really good game as well, but they made shots, they made shot down the stretch.  They got stops, which they have been doing.  We shot in the low 40s again.  They got stops and then they made play after play down the stretch.",
        "9": "Yeah, I mean, before the series even started we knew what we was dealing with.  I said it after we won the Eastern Conference Finals that we're getting ready for a juggernaut.  It's probably the most, most firepower I've played in my career.  I played against some great teams, but I don't think no team has had this type of firepower. So even when you're playing well, you got to play like A plus plus, because they're going to make runs and they're going to make shots and they got guys that's going to make plays.  So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ball game, but they made a couple more.",
        "10": "On me personally, I mean, obviously it's physically and emotionally draining because I give everything to the game and want to put myself and my teammates in a position to be successful.  So but I lay it all on the floor, and I did that tonight, gave everything that I had, both mentally and physically.  So obviously I'm drained right now, ready to get home.  But you're going against a team like this and you put together a game like we had where we had an opportunity, it's definitely draining.",
        "11": "No.  No, I did, like I said, I gave everything that I had to this game, so I don't look at it saying I wish I could have did this or I would have did that.  I left it out on the floor. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "Of course you guys are back home.  You played fantastically in the first two games, but you're down 2-0.  How frustrating it is for you to be here down 2-0, despite you playing so great?",
        "1": "Do you think for you personally it would be better to play even better, if it's possible, because you're playing so good or inspire your teammates to elevate their games?",
        "2": "You guys faced the exact same 2-0 deficit a year ago when you came back to Cleveland.  How, if at all, does this 2-0 deficit feel different than the one you faced a year ago?",
        "3": "You've said that the biggest difference between the Warriors last year and this year is K.D.  You've told us that.  How does that change the dynamic of this series for a team that's coming home down 2-0?",
        "4": "This is kind of similar to that, but this is two years in a row where you guys have trailed pretty much the entire series against this team.  Obviously you caught them at the end last year, but does it take a mental toll on you to constantly be playing from behind against this team in a seven-game series?",
        "5": "You've always said that throughout your career things never came easy, you always had to go the hard route, hard path.  With this situation right here that you're in, do you feel like this is not comfortable territory but territory that you're accustomed to?",
        "6": "I know you want to get guys involved and you need to get guys involved offensively.  Is that harder to do, though, at this point in the series when you're down 2-0 and you probably need to be more aggressive?",
        "7": "A lot of people say, though, the one thing you guys could do is slow the game down.  Is that easier said than done, and how do you do it against a team that runs like they do?",
        "8": "That was my question, can you afford to play at this fast pace, because it seems to favor them?  If you don't believe that this series has been played at their pace so far, what -- well, do you feel the series has been played at their pace?",
        "9": "You said that it's just a game and it's basketball, right?  Can the rest of the guys playing in their home arena, can it -- can you kind of forget about the pageantry and the stage and just fall into playing a basketball game?  Is it easier to do at home?",
        "10": "It seems like the Warriors in the third quarter, the differential's been pretty big and the runs that they go on after you guys cut it to so close, they can just go up in the snap of a finger.  What's the best way you can just kind of not allow that to happen, I guess?",
        "11": "You also said that you want to get Kyrie Irving going early, kind of like how you guys did with Kevin for those first two games.  What's the best way you can do that for him?",
        "12": "There's been talk obviously here about pace, and there's been some chatter about maybe a change with Iman for JR.  How do you sort of balance the need to adapt to the situation versus trusting who you've been all year?",
        "13": "If there is one thing, one aspect that you can change for Game 3, Tyronn Lue said this would be defensively, what's your opinion?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, I wouldn't say frustrated.  Just you never want to be down 2-0 in a series against anybody.  So we had some things that we need to do better obviously from Game 1 and Game 2 to get Game 3 tomorrow, and we look forward to the challenge once again. We know it's a tall challenge for us, but it's a great moment to be a part of, so we look forward to what tomorrow brings.",
        "1": "Well, at the end of the day there's other things that I can do better and hope that I can do better to help this team be successful.  It is my leadership, and try to use my inspiration to help the guys as well. So we all have a job to do, and we want to all try to do it even better than we can at times.  So if I can give a little bit more, then I will.  But I leave everything that I have out on the floor every night, so I'm always satisfied with the way I play.",
        "2": "I don't know, I don't remember how I felt last year being down 2-0.  That's last year and I don't even know the feeling anymore.  So just mentally I'm just mentally strengthening my mind and getting my mind ready and focused on what tomorrow's going to bring, and so I look forward to it.",
        "3": "No, it doesn't change anything.  We got to protect home.  It starts with tomorrow.  One game at a time, one possession at a time, and cleaning up on some of the miscues that we have had in the first couple games and not have as many.",
        "4": "I don't know.  It takes a mental toll just when you lose.  No matter if it's a series or game or whatever the case may be, in the post-season any loss always takes a mental toll on you.  But how can you refocus your mind, how can you refuel it to understand that at the end of the day it is a series.  So you got to try to focus on the next game and focus on your job and what you can do to help your team be successful going into the following game.",
        "5": "Yeah, it's something I am accustomed to.  It's something that I feel like is -- that it's okay for me to kind of always go back and know that I can refocus.  I can get my guys ready, get myself ready.  But you hate to continue to put yourself in these positions, but at the end of the day it's still just basketball, man, and that's what gives me comfortable and I'm more comfortable about it because it's just a game.  I prepare myself, I'm going to go out and do my job and live with the results.",
        "6": "I don't really know.  I never really understood that question as far as my game.  I play my game and I don't change it no matter what the series is, I don't change it what the course of the day is, I don't change it what the score is.  I just play my game. My game is being aggressive.  My game is getting my guys involved.  My game is getting into the paint, shooting some outside shots when they're available.  But my game is -- it is what it is.  So it's not going to change because a series -- I'm down 2-0 or up 2-0.  It's going to be the same.",
        "7": "That's not our game.  We don't play slowdown basketball.",
        "8": "We play at our pace.  We play our game.  We got to this point playing our way.  We have won a lot of games playing the way we play, so we're not going to change.",
        "9": "For myself, I can only speak for myself, I don't know what -- I mean, for me, like I said, no matter win, lose, or draw, if you give everything you got to the game and you prepare yourself mentally, physically, you do your job, then there's nothing to be afraid of the moment for, there's nothing to be disappointed or about the game or how the outcome is.  If you prepare yourself, then you can be okay with the outcome.  I mean I can.  I speak for myself.",
        "10": "Take great shots and not turn the ball over.  We had an opportunity, last game, we cut it to four, and then they made a couple plays here, I think.  If I remember, it was -- I think it was 86-82, they come out, I did a stupid strip foul on Livingston, he hits two free throws, we come down and turn the ball over, and then they hit a three and it went from a four-point game to a 10-point game that fast.  So just can't make bad plays against a team that's that great.",
        "11": "I think he does a great job of it as well, but it's just some of the sets that we call, and that's just -- you can say it, you can put him in position to be successful, and we just try to lay bodies on his guys that's guarding him, make -- if he's open, just get him the ball on time, on target, and let his talent take over from there.",
        "12": "Yeah, I mean, some of these questions are kind of out of my hands, as far as when you talk about lineup changes and what y'all should do offensively.  I'm one of the players on the team.  I'm a big piece of the team, I know that, but I'm not in control of who should be in inserted into the lineup, who shouldn't be. I think we have all trusted each other, we have all been in position where we trust each other out on the floor.  And whoever is on the floor has to do their job, and we trust that they will do their job.  So we look forward, like I said, to whatever our coaching staff has planned for us tomorrow night.",
        "13": "We just want to continue to play how we did in Game 2.  I thought we were much more physical, we had bodies on bodies and we have to do that against those guys, because if we let them run free, then they are even that more dangerous. So like I said, if we do a good job of not turning the ball over and forcing turnovers like we did in Game 3, that will put us in a lot better position as well and just continue to get contesting their shots.  They do make a lot of contested shots, and some of those we can live with, but some of the ones that we can't live with or we don't have a hand in or we give them open looks or things of that nature or messing up on communication on some of our defensive sets, but if we -- we have a great game plan, and if can follow that for the full 48 minutes, then we give ourselves a great chance to win.

      "questions": {
        "0": "You talked about preparation.  Did you prepare differently for this NBA Finals than you prepare the rest of the regular season?",
        "1": "How will playing with pace assist you in Game 2?",
        "2": "Have you done any simulations inside your mind on getting a good start on Game 2, or is it something that you go with the flow?",
        "3": "How can you exploit those pick-and-roll situations that you guys did so amazingly in the last Finals?",
        "4": "Is getting more physical something that you need to do?",
        "5": "Coach Lue said this is the best team he's ever seen.  Do you agree with that?",
        "6": "Winning a road game in 30 straight in playoff series, what does it mean to be able to go on the road and have so much success?",
        "7": "Is it weird the last time you didn't get one was (indiscernible)?",
        "8": "How do you get Korver more involved?",
        "9": "What does picking up the pace look like?  Does that fall on you and Kyrie?",
        "10": "You always talked about the difference between aggressive turnovers and unforced turnovers.  When you look at the film from Game 1, did you see more of one or the other?",
        "11": "What can Tristan Thompson do to be more effective on the floor?",
        "12": "Golden State was so successful in Game 1 even though two of their top stars didn't get much going offensively.  Does that pass through your mind?",
        "13": "You and Randy [Mims] and Mav [Maverick Carter] and Rich [Paul] have been together for so long.  Their impact over the last 10 years in terms of easing everything else and allowing you to concentrate on what you need to concentrate on.  How important has that been?",
        "14": "How important is it to have somebody thhat you don't have to put them through the BS detector?  You know it's real.",
        "15": "How do you block out the noise and what do you say to your teammates who are trying to block out the noise with you, especially the guys that are here for the first time?",
        "16": "Most of the guys on the team say that you control the music in the locker room before the game.  Is the playlist going to change now that you're down 0-1?",
        "17": "(Indiscernible) rigorous work ethic.  As you get older, do you think you have to (indiscernible)?  Or is that something you'll continue to do?",
        "18": "What defensive adjustments does the team need to make?  Is it simply attitude? Or aggression?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No.  It's the same way I prepare for every game.  I don't take for granted the opportunity to play in this game.  So it's been the same.",
        "1": "Well, you can't play with pace when you turn the ball over.  That's one thing we did in Game 1 that we're going to be very conscious about going into Game 2, especially on their home floor. We're a team that plays with pace.  We know that.  And in order for us to be as good as we can be offensively, we have to play with pace.  But we have to control the ball as well.",
        "2": "I don't simulate anything in my mind.  I just think about the game plan.  I think about the matchups and things that we can do better. So we have today, and we're going to prepare tomorrow as well.  Get ready for the game.  We'll be ready for the challenge.",
        "3": "We have to be much better.  Game 1 was the feel-out for us, and they definitely took advantage of all our miscues.  We just have to get better.",
        "4": "That's always been something that we talk about, so we look forward to seeing what we can bring to the game in Game 2.",
        "5": "I've seen a lot of great teams, and they rank right up there.  They work well together.  They have some guys that can actually lead a franchise without anybody else by themselves.  They put you in tough positions defensively and offensively, so you have to be able just to keep your composure, stick to the game plan and try to execute as best as you can for sure.",
        "6": "I don't know.  For me, I approach every game the same way, no matter if I'm at home or on the road.  But I understand the road is very challenging, especially when you get to this level -- you get to The Finals, you get to the Eastern Conference Finals.  It's very difficult to win on the road, and I've been fortunate to be able to do that in my career.",
        "7": "No, it's not.  I don't even know about the stats of my career until someone brings it up.  So I don't get caught up in what I've done over the years.  I get drawn in too much of what I'm doing right now in the present, and my only focus is what I can to help this team be better for Game 2.",
        "8": "It's going to be in the flow.  When it's least expected, he's going to knock down some shots.  He actually had some great looks in Game 1, two of them in the first half for sure where he had some wide-open ones and just wasn't able to connect.  One right before the halftime he had one at the top of the key, wasn't able to connect. So we always like to get him involved.  He does a great job of spreading the floor for us.  And when he's going, the rest of our team does as well.",
        "9": "Pretty much.  It falls on the ball handlers -- myself, Kyrie, D-Will [Deron Williams], Shump -- that bring the ball up the floor.  But also it's guys just running wide.  We all have to just run out, create space, create opportunity early in the offense before the defense gets set, where they're really good at.",
        "10": "We had a lot of unforced turnovers.  Some of them was aggression.  I had two charges -- that's aggression, I can take those.  But I also had some where I got caught up in the air, trying to make some skip passes, and they were able to pick them off.  Those are like pick-sixes.  It's like throwing the ball to Deion Sanders.  For the most part, it's going to be a touchdown going the other way. So there's a fine line.  You'll have some of those tight turnovers where guys are getting into the lane and trying to make a play -- that's okay.  But once you get caught up in the air or you're just swinging the ball carelessly and they're picking those off, you can't have those.",
        "11": "Be himself.",
        "12": "No, no.  At the end of the day they have so many -- it's not about scoring.  If you know Draymond, first of all, scoring is the last thing in his mind.  He's going to always guard one of the best players on the opposing end.  He's going to get rebounds, he's going to get guys involved and he's going to use his basketball IQ.  Klay had some good looks and they just didn't go in. We don't get involved in who didn't play well, who played what.  Their team played well, and that's all that matters.",
        "13": "It's been very important.  I think that not only as far as them being able to handle things off the floor so I can focus on basketball, the biggest thing Maverick, Raymond and Rich have given me is that if I'm messing up they're saying, what they hell are you doing.  You need to snap back, whatever you're doing, that's not how we do it.  When you have people around you like that who not just along for the ride and just always saying yes and saying you're doing well even though you're not, that shapes you.  That shaped me.  It shaped me to become who I am today. They stay on me constantly.  If there's something they don't see to be in my right judgment, then they tell me.  When you have that open dialogue and that respect for each other as men, it definitely allows me to not only be a better basketball player but a better man, a better husband, a better friend, things of that nature, a better dad.  They've allowed me to be comfortable being me.",
        "14": "Right.  Just the years we've been together.  I've known Maverick since I was 5, I've known Randy since I was 8 and I've known Rich since I was 14, 15.  We have been around this whole thing, we have seen it all and we kind of grew up together.  To know that they're not going to sugarcoat anything with me, no matter if I like it or not, it means everything.",
        "15": "I really don't hear the noise.  I couldn't really care less.  It really doesn't matter to me.  I'm just here to play ball and compete for a championship.  The narrative and people writing articles and things like that, I don't care.  Those things doesn't bother me. So it's hard for me to even tell my teammates, hey, don't listen to it, because I don't even get involved in it.  I stopped caring a long time ago, so it doesn't even bother me at all.",
        "16": "No.  It's whatever I'm feeling.",
        "17": "That's a great question.  I don't know.  My mental motor is still going, and my physical motor is trying to keep up with it.  It's like that's all I know.  It's like anybody that wakes up and the first thing they do is go get some coffee.  They can't do anything without drinking coffee.  Or the first thing they do is read the newspaper.  You know it's just who I am.  The first thing I do when I wake up is I go to the gym.  No matter if I'm at home or on the road, it's just part of my DNA.  I don't know if it will slow down.  Obviously I know I won't be able to play this game forever, but I do know I'll be able to work out for quite a while.  I think it's just a lifestyle for me.",
        "18": "It's not that simple.  You need to be more aggressive, you need to have a better attitude --  if it were that easy, we would all do it.  It's not that simple, especially when you're going against such a well-oiled machine in Golden State.  So we will make adjustments and they will too.  That's what good teams do, and we look forward to see what happens tomorrow. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "From your perspective, what went wrong in that third period?  The game was still within reach, and then they broke it open late in the third.",
        "1": "One follow-up with that, so much was made about the time off for both teams, any prospect of rust being a factor?",
        "2": "If there was one thing that stands out to you about them, whether it's speed or whatever, what would it -- what was it for tonight?",
        "3": "He just -- obviously he hasn't been here in the last two Finals.  I mean, what is it about him?  What kind of impact does he make?  How does he change things?",
        "4": "Doc Rivers said that the Warriors have this penchant for making teams almost concentrate too much on the three.  You start to get it in your head that you need to prevent them from 3-pointers, and then the inside opens up.  Were you guys victims of that tonight, did you feel that?",
        "5": "Follow-up, Kyrie and you got into a lot of isolation situations.  Do you feel like the ball needs to move a little more?",
        "6": "When your offense isn't flowing the way that you're used to and you're turning the ball over the way that you were tonight, what can be done, if anything, to not allow that to carry over to the defensive end?",
        "7": "Were you surprised how many times the Warriors drove in and got to the rim tonight?",
        "8": "As a leader, what is your message to your teammates after a bad lost like this?",
        "9": "Tristan seemed to have a tough night.  A bunch of guys had a tough night.  Outside of you, Kyrie, and Kevin, what do you need from the complementary players in this series?  What do you need out of them?",
        "10": "First quarter you had eight free throws, you had four the rest of the game.  Do you feel like you could have been doing more driving to the hole?  It's one of your strengths, obviously."

      "answers": {
        "0": "And that's -- it wasn't just the third quarter, it was the whole game.  It started with myself having some turnovers, especially in the first half.  I pride myself on not turning the ball over, and I did it too much. So 20 turnovers for 21 points on the road and 56 points in the paint, we did a great job of covering the 3-point line, but other than that, they played a hell of a game.",
        "1": "No, I don't think so.  But I also know that you cannot simulate what they bring to the table.  No matter how many days that you have to prepare, you can't simulate what they have.  So it's great to get the first game up underneath us.  We made a lot of mistakes; they capitalized.  And we get an opportunity to get a couple days to see what they did and see what we did wrong and how we can be better in Game 2.",
        "2": "K.D.",
        "3": "I mean, you take one of the best teams that we had ever assembled last year, that we saw in the regular season and in the post-season, and then in the off-season you add a high-powered offensive talent like that and a great basketball IQ like that, that's what stands out. I mean, it's no if, ands, or buts.  It is what it is.  We got to figure out how to combat that, which is going to be a tough challenge for us.  But that's what stands out.",
        "4": "No, we was victims of ourself, for one.  Like I said, we had 20 turnovers, and there's no way you're going to win a ball game having 20 turnovers against this team and on the road.  But at the end of the day, we gave up a lot in transition.  They had 27 points on fast breaks.",
        "5": "That's part of our game.  That's part of our game.  It's what got us here.  So we definitely want to be more in the 20s in assists, but that's what got us here.  And we got to be able to make shots.  We got to be able to move the ball.  We know that.  But playing iso ball has helped us get to this point, and it has gave us success in the last three years.  So we don't want to have a high steady diet of it because the defense becomes stagnant and our players become stagnant, but that's part of our package.",
        "6": "Well, I think that -- I mean, a couple instances.  First of all, we got to stop the ball in transition.  There was a few times where we fanned out to the 3-point line and let guys just go right down the middle for a dunk.  And I know, I believe, K.D. had two or three of those.  So when you turn the ball over, you got to know that that's their best.  That's when they become very dangerous because those guys, they sprint down the lane, they sprint to the 3-point line, they put a lot of pressure on your defense. But the ball is the number one thing.  We got to stop the ball first and then fan out to the 3-point line if those guys go there.",
        "7": "No, I wasn't surprised at anything.  They are a high-powered offensive team.  They can shoot the ball from the perimeter, they can get into the paint.  They do everything exceptionally well, if not great.  So never surprised by anything that they can do.",
        "8": "Just get focused on Game 2.  We made a lot of mistakes.  There's nothing really needs to be said.  We know we're capable of playing a lot better.  We didn't play as well as we know we're capable of, so we look forward to the next one.",
        "9": "Just to be themselves and do what they have done throughout the course of the season, throughout the course of the last couple years.  Play with energy, play with effort, play with their mind and their bodies and understand what we're trying to accomplish. So it's going to be -- this is The Finals, and we don't care about making mistakes, just play as hard as you can and follow the game plan, have your mind in it.  And if your mind is fresh and your mind is into it, then a lot of things take care of itself.",
        "10": "Well, the game is -- I mean, it's played how it's played.  I don't know.  I mean, first half I had six turnovers, second half I had two.  So could I have turned the ball over more in the second half?  I mean, the game is just -- the game is just played that way. MODERATOR: Thank you, LeBron. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "You've always been outspoken about social issues, and it seems that you're kind of in the middle of one.  The incident at your home in Los Angeles, do you have any comments on that?",
        "1": "That's such a strong statement from you and now we turn it to basketball, when you're talking about real-life issues.  How do you move on to that, looking ahead to tomorrow night and knowing that this took place?",
        "2": "At this point, LeBron, going to so many Finals, I'm sure you've heard almost every type of question, answered every type of question.  Do you mind telling us a story or an experience from your Finals experience that maybe we haven't heard before?",
        "3": "What's your relationship with Kevin Durant like?  I know you spent time in the off-season, you've played on national teams.  And like I know in 2011, didn't he come out to Akron to come train with you a little bit?  Do you have that relationship still, or is it a healthy, competitive --",
        "4": "One more question about the incident.  How do you explain something like that to your own children?",
        "5": "You've been through multiple highs throughout your career, last year, sounds like this is it again, do you still get a drive or a high of trying to -- I don't want to say prove people wrong, but just try to silence folks?",
        "6": "I wanted to know if the incident stirred any emotions inside of you and how you manage them, if it does.",
        "7": "You do seem very aware, though, of your historical perspective in the game, seven straight Finals with two different teams and now part of this trilogy.  Do you see each step of this, and this one in particular, as another brick in building your own personal legacy in the game?",
        "8": "If I could follow-up, how deeply satisfying was it to you especially after the circumstances under which you left Cleveland to then return last year and deliver that title?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, as I sit here on the eve of one of the greatest sporting events that we have in sports, race and what's going on comes again and on my behalf and my family's behalf.  But I look at it as this.  I mean, if this -- if this is to shed a light and continue to keep the conversation going on my behalf, then I'm okay with it.  My family is safe.  At the end of the day, they're safe, and that's the most important. But it just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America.  And, you know, hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day.  And even though that it's concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you and when they see you they smile in your face, it's a life every single day. And I think back to Emmett Till's mom, actually.  It's kind of one of the first things I thought of, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America. So it's like it doesn't -- no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is -- it's tough.  And we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans, until we feel equal in America.  But my family is safe, and that's what's -- that's what's important.",
        "1": "Well, at the end of the day, I'll be focused tomorrow on our game plan and focused on these games.  But I also know, I mean, I'm at a point in my life where my priorities is in place and basketball comes second to my family.  It actually comes after me continuing to be a role model to the youth and what I do as far as with my foundation.  It won't take no -- I will be as focused as I can be on the job at hand tomorrow, but it always -- this is a situation where it just puts me back in place of what's actually more important, and basketball's not the most important thing in my life.",
        "2": "I can't even sit here and to even think about it -- I'm just -- I'm in a position where I'm just blessed and I'm honored to be a part of -- we have All-Star Weekend and we have The Finals.  These are our two biggest events.  The NBA Draft would be third.  And I'm sitting here, once again, with this franchise and being able to be a part of the NBA Finals where our game is covered by so many different countries all over the world and it brings the spotlight to two of the best teams that we have in our sport today.  So that's what I'm more proud about, and that's the story I have right now.",
        "3": "Our relationship is very good.  Our relationship consists of if someone needed something, we can always reach out to one another.  And if not, then it doesn't take away from it.  We have always had a mutual respect of one another, being competitors.  I've always wanted to -- because I was in the NBA before him and when he came in, I watched him and things of that nature, even before he came in I always gave him just an if you need anything to bounce of or someone to bounce something off, you can always use me because I had experience being drafted to a franchise that now they're expecting you to be the franchise player. So with him going to Seattle, he always could use me and things of that nature.  And so all over the course of the years throughout his -- throughout his journey, I've always had an open-door policy and with K.D., and so I guess that's pretty much it.",
        "4": "Oh, I think the most unfortunate part is that I'm here right now and I can't be home to see my boys right now.  My little girl's too young to actually understand it right now.  But I can't sit in front of my boys right now and I won't be home until next week, so this is kind of killing me inside right now, but my wife is unbelievable.  My mother, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, they're going to do a great job of talking to them when they get home from school today.  Because of Apple being so great, I can FaceTime them and -- but I like to do face-to-face conversations when it becomes with a situation like this. But that's the -- I talked about this before, having two sons, two sons that's very -- they have great minds, they're very open to life and love life and things of that nature, so for me to be able just to try to give them the blueprint as much as I can on what life has to offer, but at the end of the day they're going to have to walk their own path, and hopefully I give them enough life skills throughout their journey where when they're ready to fly, they can fly on their own.",
        "5": "No, I'm not in that department anymore.  I left that in the 20s.  I'm not in the \"prove people wrong, silence critics\" people department no more.  I got a promotion when I got to the 30s.  So at the end of the day, I mean, I know what I've done and I know what I'm built -- I know the way I'm built, my only motivation is to be able to compete for a championship every single year.  And I'm sitting here today blessed once again because I put in the work and our teammates have put in the work.  So, yeah, that doesn't matter to me.",
        "6": "Well, I have a -- I mean, obviously you see I'm not my normal energetic self.  It will pass.  That's fine.  I'm figuring it out.  I'm thinking about my kids a lot.  Obviously I'm not in front of them, so but my wife -- I talked to my wife and she was pretty -- she's -- she's the Energizer Bunny of the family, and she said everything's fine.  So that helps me out a lot. But time heals all.  And at the end of the day, like I said, if this incident that happened to me and my family today can keep the conversation going and can shed light on us trying to figure out a way to keep progressing and not regressing, then I'm not against it happening to us again.  I mean it's as long as my family is safe.",
        "7": "Well, I think that I never really talk about my legacy.  I kind of just live in the moment and if I'm able to accomplish something, then it kind of adds to it on its own.  So in this instance, seeing some of the stats and some of the history and things of that nature, and I'm the first person to go to the Finals seven straight times since I think Bill Russell and those guys back in the '50s, I believe, or '60s, and I was the first guy to take a franchise -- two different franchise to the Finals four times.  So at the end of the day I want to be able to once I hang it up and not play this game anymore, that people can look at what I was able to accomplish, win, lose or draw, and say that he made a difference.  So that's what I'm here for.",
        "8": "Well, it was a goal of mine.  Satisfying is -- I'm not a, I don't like to be satisfied too much.  Because then you become complacent.  But it was a reward because when you set out a goal and you're able to achieve that reward or achieve that goal, like all of us, then it's rewarding and you feel good about it. But I'm not a complacent person.  After we was able to accomplish that last year and we celebrated for a few days, I got right back to work, mentally and physically get my body ready because I wanted to be able to put myself and put our teammates and put our franchise in position where we had an opportunity to do it again.

        "1": "LeBron, given how far the Celtics made it this season and that they also own the No. 1 pick, how likely do you think it is that you'll see them in a rematch next year in this series? Le",
        "2": "What goes through your mind on a night like tonight?  You become the all-time leading scorer in the postseason, you're going to your seventh Finals, you're going to face the Warriors for the third time in a row.  None of these things have ever happened before.  What do you pick to think about? Le",
        "3": "Going back to those guys who haven't been to The Finals, what's the message to them as they get ready for this journey? Le",
        "4": "Richard Jefferson said in the locker room today, he was asked about you breaking MJ's record, and he said, I can go on record and say that when LeBron James is done playing, his records will never be broken.  Just your thoughts on hearing that from RJ, one of your teammates. Le",
        "5": "LeBron, from the number that you wear on your jersey to just the way people have talked about this one guy, that he's such a luminary in the game and you're trying to chase it, how do you put into words passing Michael in such a statistic that has a lot of stature in this game? Le",
        "6": "LeBron, I heard what you said about living in the moment, but is there a particular challenge about defending the title against these guys? Le",
        "7": "You've said multiple times now that growing up you never thought you could reach Michael's status.  When did you realize you could? Le",
        "8": "You're on the green, if you're not. Le",
        "9": "But you're obviously in the discussion.  It's a barbershop debate, but you're in that discussion.  When did you realize you could be? Le",
        "10": "You said that trying to be like Mike was impossible because he's like a god, but what would it mean for you to kids now to say they want to be like LeBron? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Absolutely.  It's the first time I've seen him since he didn't return for the second half in Game 2, I believe.  Yeah, Game 2.  Throughout the series we didn't get an opportunity to actually have that moment.  I know I said a few things in the media about the situation he was going through, but I was happy to see him.  Just give him a big hug from myself and my family.  Just how tough and determined the guy is, and to be able to go through the situation he was going through on a day-to-day basis, still being focused and maintaining his focus for the team -- family is everything, and basketball comes second after family, and to see him perform the way he was performing throughout the playoffs under the circumstances was a treat to watch.  A lot more words were said, but that's the gist of it.",
        "1": "I don't know.  That's a question that none of us can answer in here.  They have a great team right now.  IT is going to come back healthy.  They have the No. 1 pick; we'll see what they do with that.  But I can't answer that question and know if we're going to play them in the Eastern Conference Finals next year.  I have no idea.",
        "2": "I think the first thing for me was seeing the excitement on Kyle [Korver's] and Deron [Williams] face.  You've got one guy with 12 years, first Finals appearance, and another guy 14.  So that's the first thing I picked.  And just to see the excitement around my teammates -- I do it for them, and they give it back to me as well.",
        "3": "Well, I don't have a message right now because we need to live in the moment.  Like I said, it's been 12 and 14 years for those two guys.  So we all need to soak it up.  This is a great moment, and this is not promised.  We know that.  But once we start to lock in on that beast of a matchup that we've got next round, then we'll be very focused and I'll let those guys know what to expect out of a Finals appearance.",
        "4": "Well, I love the fact that RJ does that because we have a great partnership, Uninterrupted, and Road Trippin' is doing very well now.  So it's a huge plug for my business and our partnership.  Thank you, RJ.  You're unbelievable.",
        "5": "First of all, I wear the number because of Mike.  I think I fell in love with the game because of Mike, just seeing what he was able to accomplish.  When you're growing up and you're seeing Michael Jordan, it's almost like a god.  So I didn't ever believe I could be Mike.  I started to focus on myself on other players and other people around my neighborhood because I never thought that you could get to a point where Mike was. So I think that helped shape my game.  I think the biggest thing for me sitting here today after breaking the all-time scoring record in playoff history is that I did it just being me.  I don't have to score the ball to make an impact in the basketball game.  That was my mindset when I started playing the game.  I was like, if I'm not scoring the ball, how can I still make an impact on the game?  It's carried me all the way to this point now, and it's going to carry me for the rest of my career because scoring is not No. 1 on my agenda.",
        "6": "I'm going to be honest, I'm not in the right mind to even talk about Golden State.  It's too stressful, and I'm not stressed right now.  I'm very happy about our accomplishment.  I have no discussion -- Golden State, they've been the best team in our league for the last three years, and then they added an MVP.  That's all I can give you right now, because I'm happy and I don't want to be stressed.  They cause a lot of stress, and I'll get to that point when we start to prepare for them.",
        "7": "I don't -- have I?",
        "8": "I'm not a golfer.  This guy right here to my left [J.R. Smith] is, though, so he'll tell me what that means when we get on the bus. J.R. SMITH: He drove the green, I'll tell you that.",
        "9": "I think at the end of the day, for my name to come up in the discussion with the greatest basketball player of all time, it's like, wow.  Like I said, I did pretty much everything that MJ did when I was a kid.  I shot fadeaways before I should have.  I wore a leg sleeve on my leg and folded it down so you saw the red part.  I wore black and red shoes with white socks.  I wore short shorts so you could see my undershorts underneath.  I didn't go bald like Mike, but I'm getting there.  (Laughter).  But it will be post-career, though.  That's the only thing I didn't do.  But other than that, I did everything Mike did.  I even wore a wristband on my forearm.  I didn't do the hoop earring, either.  That was Mike.  But I did everything Mike did, man. I wanted to be Mike, so for my name to come up in any discussion with Michael Jordan or Kareem or all these guys that's paved the ways for Tristan and Kevin [on podium with James] and myself and Swish [J.R. Smith], it's a wow factor.  I don't really have anything to say.",
        "10": "That's all part of the plan.  It's been part of the plan since I really started taking this game serious, to say how can I get the youth to feel like passing the ball is OK, making the extra pass is OK, drawing two defenders and no matter if you win or lose, if you make the right play, it's OK.  Because like you said, scoring the ball is so heralded in our sport.  I want the fundamentals of the game to be as great as they can be.  And if some kid or a group of kids from the West Coast or the East Coast or the Midwest or the South and everything in between all around the world can look at me and say, well, I made the extra pass because LeBron made the extra pass, or I got a chase-down block and I didn't give up on the play because LeBron didn't give up, that would mean the world to me. So we'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  Appreciate it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "When you were on the bench with four fouls, Kyrie just went to another level.  33 points in 19 minutes I think it was when you had your fourth.  What did he show you and the world tonight? Le",
        "1": "When the Celtics were switching on you in the fourth quarter, what were you seeing? Le",
        "2": "Fourth quarter it seemed like it all came back to you scoring the ball and shooting the ball over kind of a difficult stretch.  Is that just kind of a thawing out thing, you're through that stretch, and return to the player, the shooter that you were the previous 10 games, or is it something you just kind of had to fight through? Le",
        "3": "By the same token do you feel as a team that you've kind of recovered now that you've got to go back to Boston for Game 5? Le",
        "4": "I was going to ask about that exactly.  Do you feel like the second half was evidence of you guys starting to understand exactly what it was they were trying to do without Isaiah now that he's not there? Le",
        "5": "They kind of caught you in a momentum shift in the second half last game.  Did they almost show you a little bit more in this one because you guys knew what was coming out? Le",
        "6": "In your career kind of looking back, have you ever seen a player get double and triple boxed on rebounding opportunities as much as Tristan has, and how big was Kevin's rebounding in addition to that just given the way that they are defending him on the glass? Le",
        "7": "You mentioned you've never had four fouls in a game.  Have you ever missed a dunk like that in a game? Le",
        "8": "When you came into the league, there was not a superstar on your team that you had to kind of manage with or manage your game with; what have you seen about the way Kyrie has either taken your example at some times or taken the lead other times? Le",
        "9": "Right, your first seven seasons, yeah, exactly. Le",
        "10": "How much did the defense help trigger that 40-point third quarter you guys as a team collectively on defense? Le",
        "11": "The sense I got from Boston fans when I left there, they didn't really feel like they'd be coming back, that you guys would come back.  How difficult will it be to close them out with a chance to go to The Finals again? Le"

        "0": "Nothing.  Same thing I've been saying since I got here.  I've been saying he's a special kid.  He's a special talent.  As the stakes get higher and higher, his game gets higher and higher, but it was nothing surprising for me.  But he rose to the occasion, and he put the team on his back, and we definitely needed that effort from him.  Like he said, he's been just kind of dictating the game and being a playmaker and things of that nature throughout the Playoffs or even throughout this series so far, but tonight, he showed why he's one of the best point guards in the league, and he commanded us to be better, especially in the second half.",
        "1": "Just trying to be aggressive.  Obviously I couldn't be as aggressive as in the first half because of the foul trouble, so if I'm on the floor I've got to be aggressive and try to make plays, help our team be successful and read the defense.  I was able to still be aggressive and find two of our shooters for two threes, found Kev, found Swish [JR Smith], so it was just trying to read the game, the game in between the game, and it worked well for us.",
        "2": "Yeah, my rhythm for the most part is broken when you -- I can't remember the last -- I don't think I've ever had four fouls in a game before in the first half, so my rhythm is kind of broken and you've got to figure out ways you can still help the team, and my teammates said be aggressive, be you.  You got us to this point and continue to do that, so I just tried to find ways to get into the lane, get into transition, when they backed off shoot the jumper and felt very comfortable with it, so I was able to get back into a rhythm very fast.",
        "3": "At the end of the day, you play the game that's in front of you.  We didn't take care of business in Game 3, they played well.  Tonight they played well again, but we was able to play well, especially in the second half, and we defended.  If we defend, then we're going to always give ourselves a good chance to win.  We look forward to the next game.  It's a difficult challenge because our preparation going into the series was going against a team with Isaiah, so now they're playing a lot differently now, so we're trying to figure out exactly what they're running and things of that nature, so it's been very difficult on us without IT on the floor, but now this is two games that we've been able to see them and we're going to get a better understanding.  We should be a lot better in Game 5.",
        "4": "Yeah, like I say, we game planned -- because their series went to [Game] 7 we game planned for both teams, and they're a different team when IT is -- I won't say a different team, they run different things just because of IT being a huge piece of the puzzle for them offensively.  So they had to kind of reshape, and that's the beauty of having Brad Stevens as your coach.  You're able to reshape what you do offensively and still be in a good rhythm.  It's been challenging for us to kind of -- plays out of time-out, kind of been killing us on ATOs and keeping us off balance, but in the second half we kind of got a little bit of rhythm, and think we'll be better in Game 5.",
        "5": "No, I mean, listen, they're well-coached, and they've got guys that's always kind of been counted out throughout their career, so they play with a lot of pride.  And then you add the green on their back and this is history, this is a franchise that you kind of no matter who's out on the floor, you have to play for that franchise and play with pride.  You know, they're giving us everything that they have, and we're expecting it, and we want the challenge.  It's the postseason.  At the end of the day, you just want to win the game.  It doesn't matter who you're going against or how you get the job done, you're just trying to figure it out, and I think we did that.",
        "6": "Yeah, I mean, when you look at some of the greatest rebounders in our game, guys who create extra possessions, you've got to figure out a way to try to take him out, and not take him out like in a bad way, but how do you keep him off the glass, and they're doing a really good job the last couple games of putting two or three bodies on him.  But when you do that, you allow our other frontcourt player who's been a monster rebounder his whole career to come up and do the thing that he did tonight, and we needed that.  We needed the 17 rebounds from Kev, and it was huge for our team.",
        "7": "I have.  I have.  I think I missed one in Boston before.  I've missed a couple drunks in my career.  I think I've made more than I've missed though.  Percentages are pretty good.  (Laughter).",
        "8": "When I came into the league or my first seven seasons in the NBA?",
        "9": "I mean, the kid is special, and he basically was just waiting for an opportunity to be able to blossom, and I'm just happy and blessed that when I decided to come back that I was able to help him blossom, I guess, because he gets to play in games that he's always been built for.  He just never had the opportunity because of the team at that point in time.  With me coming back and we're getting Kev and making a trade for J.R. and T-Mo [Timofey Mozgov] and Shump and all the pieces and all the pieces started coming together and Double T [Tristan Thompson] gets better and Delly [Matthew Dellavedova] and all that, and in year 1, even though it wasn't the successful season we would have hoped for, it gave him some experience that he didn't have in his first -- I don't know what he had, four seasons before I got here, that he didn't have.  But he was already built for it.  His game was built for it, and I'm happy, like I said, to be able to, I guess, sit back with four fouls and see him do what he's always been built to do.  He was born for these moments.",
        "10": "Well, in order to be successful, you have to defend.  You have to defend.  And especially versus a team like this who moves the ball, shares the ball, moves bodies, and they're very precise with their offensive sets.  You have to defend, and it allows us to get to our best attribute at times and that's to get out on the open floor.  I think that allowed us to outscore them by 17 in the third.",
        "11": "Well, it's all -- the close-out game is always the hardest, and also you're doing it, and Boston is going to make it even harder.  We have to go in with a bunker mentality that we had in Game 1 and Game 2 to go out and do what we do, but we have to defend.  We have to execute offensively.  We have to have low turnovers, and we have to try to make them miss because some of those guys play a lot better at home.  That's just how the game be played.  But we'll play the game, and we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "Momentum.  We didn't continue to press the tempo.  Marcus Smart started to hit a lot of threes.  They started to get momentum, and that's what happens -- you give a team a life.  They played so freely without IT, and they just made play after play after play, and we couldn't weather the storm.",
        "1": "I had a tough game, period.  Not just in the second half.  Me personally, I didn't have it.  My teammates did a great job of keeping us in the game, building that lead.  But me personally, I didn't have it.  That's all I've got to say about my performance.",
        "2": "No, it's never that.  We've been playing so well, but like I said, you let a team grab momentum like that, you almost knew that that last shot was going to go in.  It was like, you already knew.  As soon as the ball went out his hands, you kind of knew that shot was going to go in because of how the game was just played throughout the second half.",
        "3": "No, no, they didn't mix up the coverage.  They did a good job of sprinting back, leveling to the ball, doubling me a little bit more in the post.  But like I said, my performance personally was all on me.",
        "6": "I mean, a lot of things went wrong.  I don't know; I can't play the game right back in my head right now, and I'm looking forward to seeing the film tomorrow when we get together.  But they moved the ball, like Double-T said -- 28 assists -- and they kept us at bay.  We couldn't get stops.  We couldn't get out in transition a lot.  Those guys made plays.  They made a lot of plays.  They got some second-chance points.  We only had two fast-break points, so they neutralized what we wanted to do.",
        "7": "No, I was just pretty poor.  I mean, what do you want me to say?",
        "8": "Well, we're going to crack down on the film tomorrow, for sure.  We've got to be a lot better.  It's the postseason.  You win some, you lose a couple, maybe, but how can you be better from game to game?  And like I said, they was better today than we were, and we've got to figure out how to be better than them in Game 4.  But we look forward to the challenge.  I think it's great -- what happened hurts.  It's a loss in the postseason.  But I'm glad it kind of hurt, that it happened the way it did -- let our foot off the gas a little bit, didn't keep the pressure on them like we have been accustomed to.  But we have to play a lot better in Game 4.",
        "9": "I said that before the series even started about Brad Stevens' ATOs.  If you go back and look at my transcript, I said he's very good out of ATOs.  He has so many different wrinkles, misdirection, thinking the ball is going this way, he has a misdirection going the other way.  You've got to kind of keep your head on a swivel.  He has a lot of packages.  So you can plan for a few, but then he might run something you've never seen before.  If we communicate a little bit better out of timeouts, it'll put us in position to be more successful against that.",
        "10": "A little bit of both.  A little bit of carelessness.  I had one when Kev ducked in, I should have faked high, bounced low.  But I just threw it, and that lets me know I didn't have it tonight.  Jae Crowder got his hands on it.  We had a couple more turnovers where we just were either overpassing or overthinking or whatever the case may be.  That definitely resulted in us not being as fluent as we've been offensively.",
        "11": "Well, I feel some adversity is all part of the postseason.  I feel like you have to have some type of adversity in order to be successful.  If it was going to happen, let it happen now; let us regroup.  Let us regroup and all the narrative and everything that was going on, let's regroup and let's get back to playing desperate basketball, which they did tonight.  So we've got to be a lot better, for sure. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "Before the playoffs, you said you thought that you had enough to win a championship this year.  What are you seeing from your team now, 10 straight?  And obviously tonight's game was what it was.  Where do you see this team right now? Le",
        "2": "Even before the series started Brad Stevens said that he felt like the Cavs had a perfect roster.  What do you feel about the roster composition and the pieces that you have and what you are potentially able to accomplish with them? Le",

        "4": "Isaiah sat out the second half.  Brad told us before you came out here that he's been dealing with an injury since last week.  Can you sense something physically different with him throughout these first two games? Le",
        "5": "Do you feel like with your physical perimeter defense you guys have kind of pushed them out of their comfortable game plan and put their backs against the wall? Le",
        "6": "Brad was saying one of the takeaways he took from the game was in the beginning of the fourth quarter Kyle [Korver] and a bunch of the veterans were out there playing so professionally.  Are you guys at a point where you're challenging each other, excellent veterans making each other better? Le"

        "0": "No, I didn't see it.  And what are you going to do about it at the end of the day?  My only job is to try to be the MVP for this team every night, put my teammates, put our franchise in position to be successful and ultimately compete for a championship.  For me, I know what I bring to the table.  This league knows what I bring to the table.  That's for you guys to write about.  It's not for me to be concerned about.",
        "1": "We just want to try to get better.  I also told you we had another level.  You looked at me crazy when I told you that.  I believe we've got another level as well.  As well as we played tonight, there were still some things we could have done better.  We had a few bad turnovers offensively that we could do better.  We had a couple miscues defensively where we gave up some open looks. We can get better.  That's the positive for our ballclub.  There's no complacency with us right now.  There shouldn't be.  It's the postseason.  But we like where we're headed and the direction we're headed right now.",
        "2": "Well, that's a huge compliment, but there's no such thing for us.  We don't have a perfect roster.  We don't have a perfect team.  But we can make up for mistakes, and we can make up for maybe some deficiencies that we may have because we communicate, we fly around and we sacrifice for one another.  That could put us as close to perfection as possible, which you can't ever get to.  But our communication level, our sacrifice, what we give to each other every night kind of covers that, kind of covers some of the faults that we may have.  And with the faults that we do have, we try to get better and better at it so we can be as great as we can be every single night.",
        "3": "I don't know.  I'm a guy who lives in the moment.  Our team is in a great groove, and I'm happy to be a part of that groove.  At the end of the day, we want to try to put ourselves in position to win every game.  That's the goal.  Can you do that?  Sometimes you come out with an L, but it's how you learn from those experiences that's going to help you out the next time.  We are in a good groove as a team, and we want to try to continue that going home.",
        "4": "No, I don't really pay attention to those things, to be honest.  I only pay attention to what's going on with our guys and how we can put a lot of pressure on the opposing team, from IT to the rest of those guys.  Obviously we didn't see him in the second half.  Marcus Smart started the second half, but that was not our concern going into the second half.  Our concern was not get complacent.  Don't do what we did in Game 1 in the third quarter here, where we gave up I think 36 or something points in that quarter.  Don't allow them to get into a good groove. It's not my concern.",
        "5": "Well, they're going to make another adjustment, and we have to be ready for that going into Game 3.  We're going to watch film tomorrow and see ways we can be better.  We do have some great perimeter defenders that take the challenge, but we also have great third-line defense as well with our front line, which communicates pick-and-roll coverages or pin-down coverages or whatever coverages and allow the guards to get up into the ball or do what they need to do to be successful versus their guards.",
        "6": "Absolutely.  We have a veteran ballclub.  We're one of the oldest teams in the league, so we all push each other.  We're here for one reason.  When you sign up to be here, we're here to compete.  We're here to sacrifice for one another.  And if you're in garbage time or if you're in in crunch time, you need to be a professional.  RJ [Richard Jefferson] has done that.  Champ [James Jones] has done that.   Channing [Frye] is doing that.  You see guys playing one round, a huge piece for one round, but then the next round certain things change.  Guys just continue to stay ready.  Guys continue to stay professional. It's great to be in a locker room like that. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "Well, there's going to be some adjustments made from both sides.  We have to be ready for it.  Obviously we don't know the exact adjustments, but we know they're going to make adjustments.  That's what good teams do, and we have to be ready for whatever they bring to the table.",
        "2": "No, I wasn't upset by it.  You know, it's a physical game.  I don't know the -- when they look at it and when they don't look at it as far as the officials.  I'm not sure when they go look at the monitor and when they don't, but I was able to get up and knock down my free throws, just keep pushing.  We've just got to continue -- the main thing is just to win the ballgame no matter how physical or how chippy it gets.  We just want to play ball, and that's all that matters.",
        "3": "I did not.  I did not see it.",
        "4": "Nothing.  We got the switch, and I feel like it's an advantage for our ball club.  Just wanted to try to get into my comfort, get into my package and get into the paint.  You know, he backed up a little bit, so it allowed me to get a little bit of a head of steam on him, and I finished at the rim.",
        "5": "I don't know.  I mean, I was just trying to use angles, seeing how my defender is playing me, and just trying to counter if they take away one thing, being able to have a counter move and things of that nature.  That's what the defense gave me, and just trying to be aggressive and trying to make it work for our ball club.",
        "6": "Our energy and our intensity.  I think our communication was high.  Our energy was high, and our intensity was there.  That's good ingredients for a good defensive performance.",
        "7": "Well, every game is going to be different, but we have a big three, and two of us got it going -- you guys seen it before when all three of us have it going, and we scored 100 points before between the three of us, but last night Kev had it going.  We just tried to keep feeding the ball, he was shooting the ball and shooting it well, he was making his free throws, grabbing rebounds, so we've just got to keep feeding him.",
        "8": "Well, the one thing that you understand is you've got a lot more time to kind of game plan, and game plan for your opponent.  In this particular instance we didn't have much time because it went seven and we had to play in 48 hours, but in the postseason you get an opportunity to game plan and know exactly what you want to do, how you want to execute it, and our coaching staff gave us a great game plan to go out there and do it.  And you also know that every possession matters.  You can't have the IT [Isaiah Thomas] three at the end of the second quarter, you can't have some of the back-door cuts from Avery [Bradley] because those plays matter.  Those plays are momentum plays.  We have to be in tune.",
        "9": "You've just got to continue to -- you've got to talk.  It's a beautiful thing when you're communicating and everyone knows where they're supposed to be defensively, because when you get stops then you can have fun.  You can go out and run around and throw the ball and shoot threes and things of that nature, so defense is always key.",
        "10": "I know.  I wish it could be the opposite.  I can't figure it out.",
        "11": "I don't know.  You know, you just -- for me, if I got two days or a day, then that's enough rest for me.  Nine, 10 days is too much.  I end up -- I train a lot.  I train almost too much.  My body kind of decides if it wants to be great or not.  Most of the time it doesn't.  But I felt okay last night.  I knew I wouldn't feel that great after the game, and I don't feel that great right now, but I kind of knew that coming off of 10 days of not playing the game, but I should be much better tomorrow.",
        "12": "Well, Double-T is one of the best rebounders in our game, especially offensively, so to be able to have him out there, and we get extra possessions and kicking out for threes is definitely demoralizing for a ball club.",
        "13": "Nope.  I ain't got time to think about what we're doing.  We need to figure out what we're going to do tomorrow.  We've got to continue to push forward.  We've got to continue to be as good as we can be every day, so looking forward to the challenge tomorrow.",

        "0": "It's too hard to say.  Just trying to make plays for myself, make plays for my teammates, keep the defense off balance throughout the course of a 48-minute game.  The coaching staff and my teammates do a great job of putting me in a position to succeed, and I just try to come through for them every night. Tonight was another one of those games where I made a couple plays to help us get a win.  But it was definitely our two bigs that set the tone.  Kev [Love] and Double T [Tristan Thompson], they were phenomenal.",
        "5": "I don't think it's no momentum.  I pretty much know how many guys I'm going to see throughout the course of a game.  I know the guy that's going to start on me.  I know the guy that's going to shift off onto me if a sub happens or if they go small or if they go big.  For me, the only thing on my mind is how we can execute the best way we can and get a bucket in this possession, either if I can get myself a shot or if I can drive, get my shooters a shot, or if I can get a double-team in the paint or get to the free throw line. It's not an individual matchup for me, no matter who's in front of me.  My mind is always racing on how I can make this the best possession at that particular time.",
        "6": "Well, for me I saw that in Kev this morning.  I knew what type of game he was going to have.  I mean, he came through for us.  We want the mentality of Kevin from Minnesota, but his usage rate don't have to be as high as Minnesota.  Obviously we all know that he was a featured guy pretty much every possession going down the floor, and here that's changed a little bit because we have other guys.  But his mentality needs to stay the same as Minnesota, and I think as he continues to get even more comfortable and comfortable -- tonight was one of those instances where every time he got the ball, it was a small guarding him or somebody was in the post, he was aggressive.  He grabbed every rebound for the most part with him and Tristan in the paint, and he was very aggressive with his shot.  He also got to the free throw line 10 times -- well, nine.  So definitely that mentality from Minnesota is what we all love.",
        "7": "We put in a lot of work.  We put in a lot of work.  Coach gave us a couple days off after we closed the series in Toronto, but after that we've been on the practice court or in the weight room training as if we were playing. There's no way you can substitute a game.  We all know that.  But the work that we put in this week, we just tried to be as up to speed as possible when the game did come.  Tonight was just another opportunity for us to implement our scheme.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and it was up to us to go out and execute it.",
        "8": "Well, I think it's the mindset that you have to have when you go on the road for a Game 1.  You can't start the game off lax or shooting a bunch of jump shots.  That's my mindset.  We've got guys that can shoot the heck out of a ball, and obviously Kev showed that tonight.  But for myself, I have to be in attack mode and just put the pressure on the defense and see what happens.  I was able to do that and kind of just set the tone early on what we needed to do.  Once I started to see the defense start to crack in, then I started to find my shooters. I don't even think we played that great tonight.  We definitely didn't shoot the ball as well as we're capable of shooting.  I know Kyle had three or four very, very good looks that he missed when we had a good stretch.  But I think the energy and the effort and the mindset was where it needed to be starting on the road, especially in the Eastern Conference Finals.",

With the Celtics, you have a history.  Can you have a rivalry with a jersey?  Because they don't have any of the players from the old days.",

        "0": "We put in a lot of work these last few days, and it's exciting for us to get back on the court.  We're playing against a worthy opponent, great coaching staff, great players, and we're looking forward to the challenge.",
        "1": "The two winningest franchises are the Lakers and Celtics, and you know the history of the game.  So you just respect that.  You look up in the stands and see the banners and see the jerseys retired and things of that nature, you respect the history it's created to this point.",

        "3": "I don't know.  It's not for me to talk about.  At the end of the day, the Celtics are our next opponent, and like I said, they're a worthy opponent.  We have to game-plan every game.  We have to game-plan for what they bring to the table, and we have to mentally focus on our challenges that we have every game.",
        "4": "We've been focused this whole week.  We got a couple days off Monday and Tuesday after we clinched versus Toronto, but since then, we've been putting in work mentally and physically.  As far as our mental side, I'm not worried about that.  It's always like the rhythm.  It'll be 10 days tomorrow since we played a game.  The rhythm is something you kind of like see if we still have it.  But as far as the mental side, mentally we're focused.",

You see your teammates, you see the court, you see the excitement, and you're playing something that you've been loving and things of that nature forever.  Even with him going through what he's been going through with his personal family and his sister, which is -- I can't put myself in his shoes.  He's been unbelievable to be able to do that.",

        "10": "No, there's a handful of guys.  Two of them were on the court at the same time, John [Wall] and Isaiah.  Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley.  That's just to name five off the top of my head.  There are some very, very good players that know how to do that.  It's going to be very challenging for us defensively, but it should be.  It's the postseason, and we shouldn't want it any other way.",

        "1": "What do you guys think you need to do in the second half? Le",
        "2": "Does that mean bringing talent in too? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, you're playing almost 38 minutes per game.  Are you comfortable with that?  Do you want to reduce your minutes? Le",
        "4": "You've been to the Finals six years in a row now. How does it feel to be the guy everyone is measured against? Le",
        "5": "(Inaudible) Le",

        "9": "Who's the most fun-loving person to be around this weekend? Le",
        "10": "LeBron, there are numbers that show, like advance numbers that show you throw the ball pretty much harder than any player in the league who passes it and farther than any player in the league.  Do you see that it takes guys time to adjust to kind of passes they get from you? Le",
        "11": "What do you make of this whole Kyrie thing? Le",
        "12": "LeBron, you have become an inspiration for so many kids, so many people, and being a role model and be able to help them.  Is that extra motivation for you? Le",

        "15": "(Inaudible)? Le",
        "16": "LeBron, you talked about the legends paving the way for you and other guys.  A lot of the guys, the younger guys here at the All-Star game talk about you doing the same for them.  What does that mean to you to hear something like that?  And are you cognizant of that impact that you're having? Le",
        "17": "LeBron, the Raptors made a big move with [Serge] Ibaka.  What's your assessment of the East right now? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Me personally, I don't get involved in speculation.  I don't read article clippings.  I don't really get involved in it.  I'll figure out a way and just try to keep my mindset on what the main objective is, and that's to help my guys get motivated every night to play basketball and play it the right way.  So it doesn't bother me.",
        "1": "Continue to improve and get healthy, first of all, which we will.  We have a great medical staff.  Get our guys healthy and just keep doing what we've been doing.  The coaching staff, they give us a great game plan every night and we've got to go out and execute.",
        "2": "That's a question for the GM sitting in his seat or for the ownership group.  For me, as the leader of the team, I'm fine with what we have, and we'll continue to push forward.",
        "3": "I'm comfortable with whatever Coach wants me to do out on the floor.  Whatever he gives me to do, I can figure it out.",
        "4": "It's motivating.  It's great.  To know that everyone is trying to build their team or wanting to get their team to try to get to where you are and try to knock you off, it's a motivating factor.  It's also a humbling factor that to know that I've been in this position for so long. For me, I want to continue to work my habits, train my body, train my mind, and work on my game every day to put me in a position to be successful.",
        "5": "Well, I mean, at the end of the day, Kevin's [Love] out, we know that.  J.R. [Smith] is out for a little bit longer still.  We haven't been healthy pretty much all season, but like I said, last week, I feel like, if I'm in the lineup and I'm healthy, I'm feeling good, then we're going to have a chance.  That's the way that I feel.  That's the way I feel like our guys feel as well because it motivates them as well when someone goes out.",
        "6": "I couldn't believe it at first.  For some odd reason, I was like -- I know Marc Gasol and [Paul] Millsap is older than me.  And then it came out those guys are like six months or three months or two months younger than me, and I was like, wow.  It put everything in perspective as far as where I've come from and how long I've been playing this game.  But at the same time, it was like, wow, man, it's a humbling thing to know that I'm still at an All-Star level.  The way I'm playing the game right now at my age, as long as I've been playing with the miles that I've been playing, to know that I'm still at this game and still an All-Star starter, it means a lot too. And then it was a blessing this year when I seen Melo [Carmelo Anthony] was taking Kevin's spot because of the injury.  Okay, I'm not the oldest guy on the team anymore.  Now Melo is.  It's pretty cool.",
        "7": "I think you saw it in the ad that I did with Nike.  That ad speaks for itself.  If you haven't seen it, you can find it online and look at it.  It's not only myself, it's Kevin Durant.  It's Serena Williams.  It's both sides --",
        "8": "Can I finish?  It's both sides.  Equality is not just athletes.  It's about the whole human race, every religion, everybody just figuring out how we can all be equal.  I think it's a very, very powerful thing, and I was happy to be part of that.",
        "9": "The most fun-loving person?  I don't know who's the most fun-loving person.  I couldn't say with any of these guys, but we've got some pretty cool guys to be around.  I think Kyrie, obviously, Kyle Lowry, [DeMar] DeRozan, Melo.  Our whole team is pretty cool.  I like our whole team.  With the Cavs, there's a lot of guys on our team that's fun-loving and things of that nature.  We even have a guy whose last name is Love, so it all makes sense.",
        "10": "It does.  It takes guys -- any time we get a new acquisition or a rookie or whatever that joins the team, it takes them a little bit of time to figure out everything, not just passes from me, but everything. My whole thing, I just try to put the pass on time, on target, and I study my teammates on how they like the ball.  Some guys like the ball seamless.  Some of them like it with the seams.  If you look at the basketball, you'll see what I'm talking about.  It's a different rotation on the ball of how they like it before they shoot the ball. I've studied guys, and I studied Kyle Korver before he got to our team and seen how he likes the ball and the rotation he likes the ball.  Now he's figuring it out, and I'm figuring it out with him as well.  It's definitely an adjustment period for anybody that joins the team.  I just try to be one step ahead, so once they get on the team, I'm already kind of in phase two.",
        "11": "Listen, Kyrie is my little brother.  He's my All-Star point guard, superstar point guard, and if he decides he wants to say the earth is flat, then so be it.  He's an interesting guy, man.  He believes it. Kyrie, the earth is flat, right? KYRIE IRVING: Yeah!  That's news! LeBRON JAMES: That's news.  There we go.",
        "12": "It's motivation, but it's also humbling too, to know that so many kids not only in my hometown, not only in our home state, but all over the United States and all over the world look to me as an inspiration, and for me to be a role model to these kids, it means everything.  Every day I wake up, it's a group of people -- there's two groups.  Well, there's three groups.  There's my family, which is my wife and my mom, my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my kids, and everyone in my immediate family.  Then there's my foundation kids that I have to make sure that I continue to set the right example for them.  And then there's the group of kids that I don't get to see and talk to every day that look at me as inspiration, look at me sometimes as a father figure, as a super hero, or just like, oh, if LeBron can make it out of the situation he was in, maybe we can as well. So it's very humbling.  It's motivating.  And it's also like a breath of fresh air to know that you have the youth that they're our future.  They look up to you and need your inspiration.  So I carry that with me every single day.",
        "13": "All-Star starting five?",
        "14": "Ever?  I don't know, man.  I can't just name five.  I can't just name five because I know if I name five, then somebody that I don't name is going to take it personal.  Then it's going to be a story.  I'm here for fun.  Every All-Star that's been in the All-Star game has been an All-Star for a reason.  I'll let you guys decide who's the all time All-Star starting five.",
        "15": "First of all, for me personally, for our team, we've done a great job of adjusting to what the league is about, and we want to move the ball, share the ball, shoot threes, attack the rim, play defense.  And the whole league is (inaudible) right now.  As far as the league, I think all our fans love it.  They love what we have as a league, and you're seeing more scoring, you're seeing more assists, you're seeing more plays.  It's a great time to be alive if you're an NBA fan or a basketball fan.",
        "16": "I mean, it's pretty cool.  I seen a couple guys name me all time starting five in All-Star, and I was mentioned a couple times.  It's like -- first of all, it's like, wow, I played that long?  But also at the same time, I just remember when I was a first-time All-Star or it was my second year, and we got a couple first-time All-Stars in Gordon Hayward and Giannis [Antetokounmpo], and just seeing how big their eyes are right now, just enjoying it and appreciative of the opportunity to be here. For me, being a seasoned vet of the All-Star game, I just want to try to set the example for them and let them know this is a great weekend.  This is a great weekend not only for themselves and their families, they should all be proud of themselves, but also for our fans.  It's a pretty cool thing.",
        "17": "I think Ibaka is a tremendous player.  I've had an opportunity to compete against him since he's been in the league and also The Finals against OKC.  He definitely has some experience to him. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, first off, congratulations on the win.  So this being your third title, there's obviously a lot of footnotes that separate this, but does this championship resonate with you as being a little bit extra special being that it's for the city of Cleveland, for the state of Ohio where you grew up?",
        "1": "I asked you a couple times about that, about the notion of what finally winning one would do for yourself and for the city of Cleveland, and also especially for Akron.  I just wonder, now that you've accomplished it, is it relief?  Is it excitement?  What are the emotions?",
        "2": "At 3-1 with them having two on their record at home, what do you think turned the series around?",
        "3": "LeBron, when you're sitting on the bench before the game and the National Anthem, you seemed to be deep in thought.  What was really going through your mind at that point?",
        "4": "You guys are losing tears there, J.R. Smith, it's a real genuine scene.  What comes to your mind, all the people that were for you when you were young?  What is happening?",
        "5": "LeBron, what is it about the athlete's mind or your mind that you don't feel that 3-1 is insurmountable especially against this team and you've got to win two here?  Then the last three games, the fire that you maybe played -- or were you fueled by anything that happened between you and Draymond, in Klay's words, to give you extra fire in these three games?",
        "6": "Your story is a bit like a Greek drama.  You come to the Cavaliers a home-grown product, you leave, you come back saying that you want to win for the city.  Can you talk about what you want to tell the Cleveland fans, the ones that got mad at you, the ones who never got mad at you?  And also right now you're an emotional person.  What is going through your heart and mind right now?",
        "7": "What message do you have for fans there right now who are watching who are very happy?  And, again, the ones who were upset with you, the ones who were never upset with you?",
        "8": "Can you even fathom what that parade's going to be like on Wednesday?",
        "9": "I spoke to the people around the team leading up to Game 7, and several people told me there is just a sense of calm emanating from you.  What put you in that mind space?",
        "10": "Finally, you told me when we were walking out in Toronto that if you got four more wins you'd share the secret motivation you alluded to last year?",
        "11": "That's fine."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Absolutely.  Just knowing what our city has been through, northeast Ohio has been through, as far as our sports and everything for the last 50-plus years.  You could look back to the Earnest Byner fumble, Elway going 99 yards, to Jose Mesa not being able to close out in the bottom of the ninth to the Cavs went to The Finals -- I was on that team -- in 2007, us getting swept, and then last year us losing 4-2.  And so many more stories. And our fans, they ride or die, no matter what's been going on, no matter the Browns, the Indians, the Cavs and so on, and all other sports teams.  They continue to support us.  And for us to be able to end this, end this drought, our fans deserve it.  They deserve it.  And it was for them.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, yeah, David, you've been harping on it a lot the last couple weeks.  But for me, I'm true to the game, and I know what I bring to the table.  I came back for a reason.  I came back to bring a championship to our city.  I knew what I was capable of doing.  I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to -- when I came back, I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we've never been.  That's what it was all about. Right now it's just excitement.  It's not even relief.  It's just excitement for us as a team, as a franchise, as a city, as a community.  To be able to continue to build up our city, to continue to be an inspiration to our city, it means everything.  I'm happy to be a part of it.",
        "2": "For me, when I came up here after we lost Game 4 at home, I said, hey, listen, we've got to take one possession, one game at a time.  We're going to Golden State, so we've got to fly home anyways, so why not have another game? And I believed in that.  And my guys believe in me as their leader every single day.  I preach to them every single day.  I'm their leader, and they allow me to lead those guys every single night.  I was just true to that.  I believed, and nobody else believed besides the other 14 guys and our coaching staff and our fans.  So it's just going out and executing and putting things together and making plays, and we were able to do that.",
        "3": "Just zeroing in on what needs to be done to help us win.  Obviously I put the effort into it, but just thinking about the game, thinking about the plays, understanding that they're going to make a run.  They're a great team.  Understanding that we're going to make some mistakes, but it's how we come back from it and how we move on to the next possession. Then also just living in the moment.  I told my guys before the game:  Listen, there is a game to be played, but there's not many guys, there's not many teams that get an opportunity to be in the NBA Finals in a Game 7.  There's just not. And this is my second one, and I'm able to say that I've been victorious twice in Game 7. I just told the guys:  Don't take this for granted.  Don't take it for granted.  Let's go out.  Our coaching staff gave us a great plan; let's go execute it.",
        "4": "A little bit of everything.  I think all the emotions, everything.  Obviously I know what J.R.'s been through in his career.  People counting him out and saying he's this, he's that, not understanding -- you can't have that.  That's not yours.  That's for Daddy. Just understand what J.R.'s been through and people just saying that there's no way he can be a winner.  When our GM came to us last year and said, hey, we've got a deal to get Timofey Mozgov and get Iman Shumpert, and the Knicks are going to throw in J.R., I was like, what?  They're going to throw in J.R. into the deal?  And I was like, okay, I've got him.  I got him. And J.R. turned himself into not only a huge boost to our team, but he turned himself into a two-way player, both sides of the floor.  And I think those emotions came out of J.R. at the end of those games.  Those emotions came out of me, just leading 14 guys and understanding, like I said, what our city's been through over the last 50-plus years since Jim Brown.  Then also people just counting me out.  Throughout my 13-year career, I've done nothing but be true to the game, give everything I've got to the game, put my heart, my blood, sweat, tears into the game, and people still want to doubt what I'm capable of doing. So that was a little icing on the cake for myself to just let me know that everything I've done, it results in this.  They say hard work pays off, and that's what happened tonight.",
        "5": "Well, I mean, at the end of the day you're down 3-1, and we've got to come here.  We've got to come here and win.  We had to win in this building anyways.  I mean, we only get three games at home.  So even if we sweep the home series in a seven-game series, we've got to win here anyway. So Game 5 was a great opportunity for us to try to seize that, and we came up with a great game plan.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and we were able to send the game back home down 3-2. And we know our fans.  Our fans give us everything, and we were able to give it back to them.  Once we get to a Game 7, I'll take my chances versus anybody, versus any team.  You give me one game, you give me 48 minutes, I'll take my chances.  Once we got to a Game 7, I was just confident.  I knew what I was capable of doing.  I knew my guys would allow me to lead them throughout the 48 minutes, and they did that.",
        "6": "What's going through my mind is I'm ready to get back to Cleveland.  I can't wait to get off that plane and hold that trophy up and see all our fans at the terminal, IX Jet Center, and I know they're going to be ready.  So I can't wait to give the emotion back to them.  I'm looking forward to it.  That's all.",
        "7": "That don't matter.  That's yesterday's newspaper.  I don't think anybody's reading yesterday's newspaper.  They'll be reading tomorrow that I'm coming home.  I'm coming home with what I said I was going to do.",
        "8": "Oh, my goodness.  It's going to be probably one of the biggest parties -- I'm sorry, one of?  It's going to be the biggest party that Cleveland has ever seen ever.  So if you guys still have a little money left over in your budget, you guys better make a trip to Cleveland and get a little piece of it.",
        "9": "I don't know.  I don't know.  I can sit up here and say -- I don't know if it was \"The Godfather,\" I don't know if it was \"Couples Retreat\" that I watched, I don't know if it was \"Ocean's 11, 12, and 13,\" I don't know if it was the \"Revenge of the Nerds\" that I watched.  I really don't know. But I was just so like, listen, you've put everything into the game.  The game always gives back to people that's true to the game.  I've watched it.  I know the history of the game, and I was just calm.  I was calm.  I was focused.  I was locked in. I don't know.  I wish I could tell you exactly what happened, but I had to be calm in order for my 14 guys to allow me to lead them and for those guys to play the way they played. I mean, I can't do it by myself, so that was my mindset.  I was confident.  I was calm.  You've got to stay low.  Like Jay-Z said, you've got to stay low and keep firing, and that's exactly what I did.",

        "5": "LeBron, that Game 7 you played against San Antonio was I think a Thursday.  The fact that this is a Sunday, winner-take-all, for all the marbles type deal, is this like your Super Bowl Sunday that you grew up as a football guy?",
        "6": "uick follow-up, this could be one of the more viewed games or most viewed games in league history.  Over the course of your career, have you seen the sport of basketball and its popularity grow?",
        "7": "When you say you can live with the results, have you always been able to live with the results, and what got you to that point where you can?",
        "8": "I know you've consistently said that if you do everything you can, you can live with what happens.  I just want to push a little bit back on that.  Given where you come from, where you've been, the whole arc of your career, you've never played in a game where if you win that game, Cleveland wins a championship.  And I wonder what you think about and what goes through your mind when you've contemplated what winning a championship would mean to Cleveland and Akron?",
        "9": "You said you don't put that pressure on yourself, but do you think of that in terms of pressure, or do you think of that in terms of opportunity, I guess would be the word?",
        "10": "Following right up with that, you have made it clear that you don't want to make this just about ending the Cleveland drought.  But do you recognize that you are on the brink of finishing the storybook ending that I guess almost everyone imagined when you came back?  I mean, you're right there.",
        "11": "There's been talk about you being MVP, win or lose, of The Finals.  What are your thoughts on that?",
        "12": "Do you feel like it should tend to go to the winning -- or always go to the winning team, or just whoever was the best player?",
        "13": "First couple games here you put up good numbers, but you weren't nearly as efficient personally as you have been the last few games.  What changed for you during the course of this series?",
        "14": "I'm just wondering, Ben Simmons has joined the Klutch family and he's been spending a lot of time in Cleveland.  What's your opinion of him?  The draft is next week.  Do you think the 76ers would be crazy to not pick him first?",
        "15": "What do you see sealing it?",
        "16": "This isn't like a big focus on this part of your game, but you had nine blocked shots in the last three games.  Do you feel as locked in defensively as you did offensively?  How big have those shot blocks been and how much do you love doing it?",
        "17": "LeBron, going back there was a stretch there of eight or ten games against Golden State that your shooting percentages were down around the 40% range.  The last four-odd games of this series, certainly the last two, they've really taken a jump up.  Is it you just sort of saying I'm going to shoot those mid-range shots that they're trying to give you?  What have you adjusted in terms of shooting in particular to take advantage?",
        "18": "I've heard you say many times that you are in the moment or the importance of being in the moment.  Is there ever a time where being in the moment is more important than in a winner-take-all game to define your season?  And how did you learn how to actually succeed at being in the moment?",
        "19": "It seems like this series hasn't worked out for Kevin Love matchup-wise, and you guys have played along fine.  But for him in this series, I know it's not important to make sure he gets him going, it's not the regular season, but in what ways can he contribute and be effective while playing in the lineup?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, I approach -- every postseason game is very key.  You don't put too much more added pressure on it because it's a Game 7.  One thing we all know is it's the last game of the season, so it's not like you're preserving any energy, be out there saying, okay, I've got to keep my body ready for the next game.  There's no next game. So look forward to the challenge.  I mean, it's a Game 7, but I don't put too much more added pressure on it.",
        "1": "Yeah, I remember pretty much everything about the game.  It was a tough game versus a great opponent.  Throughout the whole game we just had -- each possession was key.  Each possession was key.  There were momentum swings back and forth, but we were able to make a couple plays down the stretch to allow us to win that game.",
        "2": "No.",
        "3": "No.",
        "4": "For me, I'm going to give everything I've got to my teammates and my coaching staff tomorrow night, as I've always done.  And I live with the results.  One thing I can't live with is if I don't go out and give everything I had to the game and not be true to the game, that would stop me from sleeping.  So I'm ready to go.",
        "5": "Yeah, I mean, it is.  I think it is for the whole world that loves the game of basketball, that's had a close eye throughout the whole postseason and throughout The Finals.  It's also Father's Day as well.  I think that's very important to all the fathers out there in the world to get an opportunity to not only be with their loved ones and kids and things of that nature, but also to be able to watch the game. So, I mean, it's pretty cool.  Like you said, to put it into Super Bowl Sunday, it's like one game.  It's one game, and you look forward to it.  I'm happy I'm able to be blessed just to be a part of it.",
        "6": "Oh, absolutely.  First of all, you give a lot of credit to all the guys that have laid the path, and then David Stern also had a vision and he's given it all to Adam Silver who has also put that vision.  Also he had his visions to continue to help grow our game.  I'm happy to say that I had a some part in the history of the game to say, hey, look, I was there when this happened or the game went to a couple more countries.  Once social media started, it continued to build our game up more.  I was a part of that timetable. So it's an honor to be a part of a sport and be part of a beautiful game that you know that not only here in America but people all over the world can watch and be proud about it.",
        "7": "Well, I think it doesn't mean I don't -- I still go back on some of the losses I've had in my career, not only in just The Finals, but even in the postseason, period. When I said that, it's like, okay, did you give everything that you had?  Did you prepare yourself the best way you could have?  Did you leave it all on the floor?  And if you can tell yourself and look in the mirror and say yes, then sometimes there are some things you can't control.  You can control what you can control.  And the uncontrollable, you can't allow that to play with you that much. It's not always been that way for me, but I think it's just from my growth, I've matured over the years and I know what's real and what's not real.",
        "8": "I don't think it's went through my mind until you asked me.  I don't put that type of thought on the game.  I came back for a reason, and that is to bring a championship to the city of Cleveland, to northeast Ohio and all of Ohio and all Cavaliers fans in the world.  That's been one of my goals.  But I don't add too much pressure on it.  I go out and trust what I've been able to do, the work I've put into it, my teammates have put into it.  And you go out there and see what happens.",
        "9": "Well, you say pressure because everyone -- that's like the whole world, the word everyone likes to use in sports is \"pressure.\"  I don't really get involved in it.  But I guess in layman's terms, pressure, I think it's an opportunity to do something special, and I'm fortunate to be in a position where I can be a part of something that was very special.",
        "10": "I don't think people imagined it this way, the route that we've taken (laughing), and that's fine.  Like I always say, every day is not a bed of roses and you have to be able to figure out how to get away from the thorns and the pricklers of the rose and things of that nature to make the sunshine.  So we've put ourselves in a position to do something special. You guys ask me the questions, but you guys know the answers to them.  I mean, if we win and we take care of business, that's something that our city hasn't had in a very long time.  So that's the obvious.  You don't need me to sit up here and talk about it.",
        "11": "Oh, listen, at the end of the day, I go out every single night and give everything I've got to the game.  The game has always given back to me.  So I'm okay with whatever.",
        "12": "I don't know how they -- last time I answered the question about MVP, it didn't go that well for me, so I'm not going to do it (laughing).  Yeah, I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it again.  I'm not.  I will not.  Thanks, Chris, I will not do that again (laughing).",
        "13": "I would like to say I grow as the series goes on.  I'm fortunate enough, first of all, to help the series go on.  And I start to learn from my mistakes and break into the film and seeing the ways that they're defending me, the ways they're defending our team, ways I can be a little more efficient.  I've gotten better as the series has gone on.  I told you guys that me turning the ball over was something I'm not happy with, and I've got to figure out a way to not turn the ball over as much.  And I've been able to do that the last couple games and put myself and my team in a position to be successful. So just digging in a little bit more and more into the film and also just being a little bit more conscious about how I can be successful for our team.",
        "14": "Well, I think he's a great young talent.  I think the way he displays on the basketball court, we all notice.  I think we all don't know just yet how great of a kid he is and how down to earth he is with the game of basketball and life in general. I had an opportunity to spend a lot of time over the last couple years with him and his family.  They're just so very appreciative of the opportunity that they've been given as a family.  Also, they give everything to their son.  They want the best for him. And as a mentor to him and big brother to him, I also give him a lot of advice on what to expect when he makes his jump next week, how to handle it.  But he also has to figure it out on his own as well because everybody's path is different.  I'm not a GM.  I don't get paid by the Sixers, so I'm not going to answer that.",
        "15": "I think he has all the tools, so it's up to him.",
        "16": "Defense has always been something of my game, it's something I pride more than the offensive end.  I've been highly upset that I've never won Defensive Player of the Year.  It was a goal of mine.  It's still a goal of mine, so we'll see what happens with that the rest of my career. But I've always taken that side of the floor very seriously, and being able to guard multiple positions, being able to know what teams are doing out on the floor and putting my teammates in position to be successful, you know, that's always been something I've taken pride in.  Every now and then I'll protect the rim a little bit (laughing).  So I've been successful with that the last couple games. But my teammates do a great job of putting me in position to be able to get some shot blocks.  Me also just not giving up on plays when sometimes guys have those full court lay-ups and have an opportunity to score.",
        "17": "Well, I can't tell you exactly what I've adjusted to.  I would feel like you are a part of the Warriors at that point.  I'm just playing my game.  I'm watching a lot of film.  I'm seeing ways I can be successful out on the floor and I'm just trusting it.",
        "18": "Well, I haven't always been successful being in the moment.  Some things you just can't control, like I said.  You can do everything you can.  You can study.  You can prepare.  You can go out and play as great as you've played before and you still can come out on the short end of the stick. It happened to me before against Boston.  Me and Paul Pierce had a duel where I believe he had 50, I believe, and I had high 40s, gave everything I had, and we lost.  So that doesn't mean I wasn't in the moment.  That meant I was there.  I was mentally sharp.  I was in tune with the game plan.  Just sometimes you're not successful. But for an opportunity for tomorrow, I mean, anybody that's ever played the game of basketball or done anything at any level, to be able to have an opportunity to have one game for it all?  I mean, you take it. It's an opportunity, and it's going to be fun.",
        "19": "At the end of the day, if we win, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  We take care of business tomorrow and we put ourselves in position to win.  If we come out victorious, I don't think there's going to be guys talking about over the summer how bad or Kevin wasn't -- he didn't play well.  He had three fouls in the first half in Game 6.  You remember Kevin picked up that third foul that wasn't a foul?  I don't think anybody's going to say that.  They're going to say Kevin Love is a champion.  That's all that matters. So no added pressure to Kevin.  No added pressure to our team.  We've got to go out and do our job.  Coach Lue is going to give us a game plan, we have to go out and execute it.  I'm the leader of the team, and I have to make sure my guys are ready. But Kevin's name will be in the record books forever if we go out and take care of business tomorrow.  Doesn't matter what he shot, doesn't matter how many minutes he played, doesn't matter how many rebounds that you all thought he should have got, how many shots he should have been, how aggressive you all thought he should have been.  He'll be sitting home with a ring.  So that's all that matters. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, the last two games your efficiency rating is off the charts, and that's something that you pride yourself on.  What's been the key to being so efficient and having back-to-back 41-point games? Le",
        "2": "LeBron, with the turnovers that you had talked about early earlier in the series, you only had two in the last game, only one this game.  Talk about efficiency.  Do you think that's helped with the back-to-back 41-point games? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, when you guys are down 3-1, to these guys that are on the left and right of you, what did you see in them or what do you see in them as a player and a person that gave you so much belief that you guys can put yourselves in position to do what you're doing right now? Le",
        "4": "You've had obviously you've been in Game 7 in The Finals once before, on your home floor then, of course.  But home, road, one chance to win this championship, will the locale matter to you whatsoever? Le",
        "5": "How long did it take for the realization to set in that you have an ultimate game opportunity?  Were you even thinking about it before the clock hit zeros? Le",
        "9": "LeBron, in the second half there was a stretch where you scored or assisted on 27 straight points.  I think you scored 20 of them.  When you get in that mode, do you find something in terms of rhythm within yourself, or is it you finding something the way they're defending you?  Can you just describe what it's like to be like that and playing like that? Le",
        "10": "You've obviously had a long history here in Cleveland.  What would it mean to you to be in the building tonight and see the fans have a game like this? Le",
        "11": "Do you allow yourself to feel that, the emotion of it being from here? Le",
        "13": "People now will say that you and Steph Curry are the two greatest players on the planet, but they don't necessarily determine which one is the best.  You've competed so hard in this series.  You seem to take special delight sometimes in blocking his shot.  Tell me what that's been like to compete against a guy that's sort of vying for that title with you? Le",
        "15": "LeBron, your degree of confidence going into this game, has it changed much from the first time you went for a championship at St. V, when you were in high school? Le",
        "16": "Obviously it took a lot from everyone, not just you, to fight back from down 3-1.  I wonder what it's taken just to get to this point, and what's left now for one more game? Le",
        "17": "Ty told us at the beginning of the fourth you said, \"I'm not coming out.\"  What is the mental process you use to shut off any physical exhaustion when you know you have to push through the fourth? Le",
        "18": "With all the offensive pyrotechnics that you and Kyrie and the statlines you're putting up, getting lost is the defense, four steals, three blocks.  That's become so typical for you and setting the tone for the whole team.  Can you talk about defense?  Because none of us would have imagined holding the Warriors down to 90 points, and things like that almost typically now.  Have you found such a defensive gear here in these Finals? Le",
        "20": "LeBron, I want to ask you about your relationship with Coach Lue and how the two of you feed off each other?  How would you compare him with many of the other coaches you've played for? Le",
        "22": "You guys have been working since Labor Day.  Tristan will have played 103 games come Sunday.  When you factor in all the work that's gone on from September through tonight and how his game is predicated upon energy and effort, how impressive or how important is what he's been doing this late in the season? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I give a lot of credit to my teammates and my coaching staff to put me in position to be successful.  I mean, without the ball moving, without the screens being set, without the coaching staff putting out the game plans for us offensively then, what I've been able to do, it doesn't happen.  So those guys definitely get the credit.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, we know we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They make you pay anytime you make a mistake, and for us to only have 12 turnovers today for 16 points is definitely key to our success. You can't turn the ball over versus anyone in our league, but especially in The Finals versus the defending champions.  You can't do it because they'll make you pay.  So we did a great job of not turning the ball over, including myself, and I just try to put myself in position, put my teammates in position to be successful.",
        "3": "Well, I mean, we just focus on the next game, focus on the next minute, and we focus on the game plan that we had to master up to try to even get to the next play.  And it wasn't even trying to get to a Game 7.  We were like, okay, well, once we went to Game 5, we went out there and being down 3-1, we were like, okay, well, we've got to go home anyway, so let's go home and play in front of our fans, and we were able to do that. And tonight, these guys were, I mean, unbelievable.  Once again, Double T's energy and activity, his level, his rebounding, obviously giving us extra possessions, but his defensive rebounding from the beginning was at an all-time high level for himself, even though as great as he is, he was spectacular tonight.  And Kyrie's just a floor general.  He does what he does.  It's no surprise what he does.  And we put ourselves in position to be able to be in a Game 7.",
        "4": "I'll take it.  It don't matter to me (laughing).  Like I told you guys the other day, it's two of the greatest words in the world, and that's \"Game 7\", so I'll play it anywhere.",
        "5": "No, I'm actually not really thinking about it too much right now.  I'm ready to start my treatment session, get home, getting something to eat, lay down, get ready for the flight tomorrow.  I'm very just chill right now, actually.",
        "9": "I'm just out there playing, just reading, reacting.  My teammates, like I said, have put me in position to be successful either when I have the ball or don't have the ball, they give me the ball wherever I would like it.  Setting great screens and trying to put pressure on their defense.  I've been fortunate enough to see the ball go through the hoop the last couple of games.  So, you know, I feel pretty good.",
        "10": "They deserved it.  They deserved it.  We knew what we were going to get out of them, and now it was up to us to go out and give it back to them, and I think we held up our end of the bargain.  We knew what we were going to get out of those guys, all 20,000-plus.  They were phenomenal from the time we ran out on the floor.  So they deserved tonight, and it was special to be out there for them.",
        "11": "Nope, I don't.  I just play.  I know what I put into the game.  I know how true I am to the game.  I know how true I am to these fans.  So, no, I don't let it get to me.",
        "13": "Oh, I mean, obviously, at the end of the day for me I think -- I don't really get involved in that.  I try to be the best player I can be for this team every night, lead these guys out.  I mean, I actually had a competitive shooting game with my kids last night.  You know, we were shooting baskets last night between myself and my two boys, which ended up not going so well for me at times.  You know, those guys have home-court advantage over me. But at the end of the day my whole mindset is how I can put myself in position to help these guys be successful and I could be successful as well.  I don't really get caught up in what everybody else talks about.  I think you should know me by now.  I see what you're trying to do, though.",
        "15": "Well, when you're prepared and you're well-prepared, then you have a lot of confidence going into a game.  I was a freshman at St. Mary, we were well prepared.  We had a great high school coach in Keith Dambrot, who is now the head coach at Akron U, who prepared us throughout the whole Playoffs, and then when we got to the state championships.  So we were prepared.  So we went out and just let it happen.  Let it play, and let it play out. Now at this point in my life, sitting here today, we're well prepared with T Lue and our coaching staff.  They prepare us, and it's up to us to go out and play, so we play with a lot of confidence and understanding that it's not -- there's nothing on the court that will blindside us because we're just a prepared bunch.",
        "16": "I guess we just take one day at a time.  We haven't rushed to get to a Game 5.  We didn't rush to get to a Game 6 today.  And we won't rush to get to a Game 7 on Sunday.  At the end of the day this is going to be it for all of us, including you guys.  One more game left, and you guys are going to give it all you've got, we're going to give it all we've got, and the Warriors will do the same, and we'll live with the results.  That's how you go about it. But we won't rush it.  I won't rush it.  I'm going to sleep very well tonight.  I'll sleep very well the following night, watch a couple movies and just get ready to play. KYRIE IRVING: I won't rush it either.",
        "17": "Well, Klay went on his own barrage for the last three-and-a-half minutes in the third quarter, and we were up 20 at one point and he kind of went on his own 12-0 run or whatever the case may be, just hitting threes, getting to the lane and just kind of took a little bit of momentum from us.  He looked at me and I was like, I just didn't want to come out.  I felt like those first couple minutes of the fourth quarter were going to be very important, and I just wanted to be out there for my teammates and try to make some plays happen, and I was fortunate enough to do that.",
        "18": "Well, you have to defend, and that's what we've all been talking about since we got together even from last year that in order for us to be ultimately successful, we have to defend, and I mean, if you don't defend versus these guys, you see what happened.  I mean, we've all seen it all year for the last couple years.  If you don't defend these guys or you make a mistake, they make you pay. So our antennas have to be up throughout the course of a 48-minute game on every possession, because as soon as you make a mistake, they get a three here, they get a slip to the rim here.  They get offensive rebound and everyone's in the paint and they seek out to the perimeter for extra threes.  So our antennas just have to be up, and I think it's been there, not every game, not as well as we'd all like, but the last few games our antennas have been razor sharp.",
        "20": "Well, I think all my coaches throughout my career have had a meaningful part of my career.  Everyone's been different in their own ways of how they philosophize the game and things of that nature, but I could talk in the present right now.  I think me and Coach Lue just kind of, we connect that's something that's bigger than basketball, our upbringing.  Being from a single-parent household, being from an inner-city community, being a statistic that you weren't supposed to make it out and there's no way you're going to make it out.  You're going to be another one of those African-American kids, and we both made it out from tough situations growing up, and people just saying there's no way you can do it. So before we even met each other, you have a sense of that type of feeling.  Then I came into the league and I'm a huge basketball fan, obviously, and I watched The Finals when he was with the Lakers and seen the spark that he gave that team when Phil Jackson gave him the nod.  And I think everybody's just so caught up in the shot that AI (Allen Iverson) made when he stepped over him, but people don't realize the impact that he made on that team, and the guy that just accepted his role.  He's able to win a championship. So our relationship has just grown over the years, and just being a competitor, going against him and then seeing him as a coach, going against him again when he was in Boston and things of that nature and with the Clippers, and then when I came back and he was the assistant coach, continues to grow. I think it's like anything, when you're around someone every single day, I guess it's like a marriage or a girlfriend.  You're around her every single day, they get better and better and better if it's genuine, and that's what it is here with myself and T Lue.",
        "22": "103 consecutive games, correct?  I mean that's phenomenal.  It's a testament to his professionalism as a young guy, him keeping his body not only in shape but understanding that it's more than just playing basketball.  Kid takes care of his body every single day, he's been durable for this franchise even before I even came back. It's a great feeling when you can walk into a building and know that that guy's going to be in uniform.  No matter what's going on, no matter what's happening, you know that guy's going to be in uniform and he's going to give it everything he's got.  It's been great, and 103 on Sunday, and hopefully out of all those games he's played, we want that one to be the best one he's played.  So look forward to it, and I'm done.  Thank you.

        "1": "I know you had talked to Adam [Silver] in the past couple years about concerns about schedule and things of that nature, the All-Star Break and stuff like that.  How much did you welcome the extra travel day when you're going cross country in a series of this magnitude? Le",
        "2": "I can't remember if you've been asked this before during these Playoffs, but do you believe in momentum carrying from game to game within a series? Le",
        "3": "Kyrie was talking about this earlier, if you take away a five-minute stretch in Game 4, it's been pretty good for you guys the last three.  Do you feel like you have momentum to whatever degree it's there? Le",
        "4": "You stated many times that you came here because Kyrie was here already as sort of a franchise guy, but how much has your relationship grown with him over time, and how much have you tried to help expedite his growth into a star? Le",
        "5": "I don't know that you need any added motivation going into tomorrow night, but it's one year to the day tomorrow that the Warriors won in Game 6 in this building.  Do you guys take anything from not wanting to see that trophy hoisted in your building again? Le",
        "6": "This is a question not related to the game, but since there's been a lot of publicity yesterday and today about Godfather II, what is the phrase that you like more from the movie? Le",
        "7": "But which is the one that inspires or represents you more? Le",
        "8": "Understanding that you and Kyrie had it going offensively the other night, what do you guys need from Kevin Love in Game 6 to do what you want to do? Le",
        "9": "In that regard, do you need more than what he gave the other night? Le",
        "10": "You've probably heard hundreds, if not thousands, pregame speeches from coaches over the course of your career.  Did anything resonate with you what Ty spoke to you guys about before Game 5?  What can that functionality, a coach talking to a team about philosophy before the floor, affect his team? Le",
        "11": "I'm sure you heard Andrew Bogut's out.  How does that impact you guys and your game plan, if at all? Le",
        "12": "When you see Draymond on the court, considering the exchange you guys had, will anything come to your mind when you see him out there on the court? Le",
        "13": "Last year, obviously, you guys didn't have Kyrie and Kevin at this time, but what else is different about coming into Game 6 this year as opposed to last year? Le",
        "14": "A lot was made comparing your game the other night to the Boston game a few years ago, and your numbers across the board in elimination games are very, very good.  Does something change for you when it's absolutely do or die like you've been saying, but it really is an elimination game?  What changes for you in that moment? Le",
        "15": "That's it?  It's that simple? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think it's a fine line, but I think true basketball people know the difference between certain iso basketball and others, and when too many dribbles of wearing a possession out and guys are not actively involved, there is a difference between that and also when guys are just attacking early in transition or they have a half-court matchup and able to go on that matchup.  So there's different forms of it.",
        "1": "Well, it benefits not only the players but also you guys as well, being able to get an extra day and prepare from coast to coast.  When I was in Miami we went to a couple places -- when I was in Miami, everywhere we went was far, and the last two years from us going Cleveland to Golden State, the one day in between was taxing on all of us.  Not just the guys on the court, but you guys as well.  So it benefits all of us as a league.",
        "2": "Yeah, I think that's always been the case in the postseason.  I think it also depends on the way you played and where you played at.  I think that helps.  But, I mean, both teams in this series have shown that they can win on each other's floor, so I don't think that matters much.",
        "3": "I feel like we'll be prepared for Game 6.  Our coaching staff has given us another great game plan.  They're going to give us some more insight on what needs to be done tomorrow morning at our shootaround, and it's up to us as the guys to go out and execute that.",
        "4": "Well, I think when you're around someone every single day your relationship automatically grows.  But when you also share some of the same common goals, it helps that process a little bit faster than others.  I've watched the kid continue to grow over the last two years, and it's a benefit not only for himself individually, but for our team, for me, and for this franchise.",
        "5": "No, I mean, I don't think we even thought about it.  It's always one year to the date of something.  You can say that about anything.  I mean, yesterday was one year to date that my son turned 8, and yesterday he turned 9.  So it happens every year, it's one year to the date to something.  We don't think about that stuff.  We just get prepared to play.",
        "6": "Oh, Godfather?  There's too many different phrases and too many different lines in that movie to just categorize one.",
        "7": "I mean, each movie is nine hours long.  I mean, what do you want me to do?  I mean, there's so many.  I don't know.  I'll let you pick one and I'll roll with it.  It's a great trilogy.",
        "8": "Just need him to be aggressive.  You know, from the defensive side of the floor and the offensive side of the floor, go out and make an impact on the game, no matter if he's not scoring, no matter if at times he feels like he's not getting touches.  We all just need to continue to be aggressive.  He needs to be aggressive to help us try to send this game back to Golden State. I think he's looking forward to the challenge.  I think he's looking forward to the moment.  We definitely need him.  He's too big of a piece to our puzzle.",
        "9": "I think with everything that he gave us, I mean, he helped us win.  We needed everybody, all 15 guys.  Even the guys that never even touched the floor.  We had two guys in suits.  We needed everybody's contribution. We definitely need Kev to play better.  We want him to play better, but we don't want to add no more stress on him or added pressure.  We just want him to go out and play, just let it hang out.",
        "10": "Oh, definitely.  His words resonate throughout the whole locker room, and some of the things he said I won't bring out to the table because it's for locker room use only.  But just his sense of calmness and his sense of just stay in the moment has definitely given, especially the young guys, just a confidence booster.  For us as a group, when you have someone that calm and collected about what needs to be done and just staying in the moment, it just helps us go out and do our job.",
        "11": "It doesn't.  We want to continue to attack.  We want to continue to not turn the ball over and stop those guys, Steph and Klay, from just having one of these barrages from the perimeter.  We also want to try to put pressure on those other guys.  Those other guys can beat you as well, with Draymond coming back and also Iguodala, and Livingston and Barnes and things of that nature, and even Andy gave them a big couple minutes last couple games, Speights as well, and everyone that they put in. Even with Bogut out, they still have so much firepower that it doesn't take any of the focus out of our mind going into Game 6.",
        "12": "My only job is to get this win, man.  We have a great opportunity to protect home court and go into two of the best words ever, and that's \"Game 7\".  So hopefully we can protect home.  That's all that matters.",
        "13": "We didn't have Kyrie and Kevin (laughing).  Those guys are a big piece of what we do.  Obviously Kyrie has shown that and Kevin throughout this postseason as well.  I think Richard Jefferson has definitely given us a huge boost throughout the whole Playoffs, Channing Frye as well, even though his minutes have been a little bit limited in this Finals.  But in the postseason they've given us a boost.  And everyone that's come back from last year's roster has given us a huge boost to get to this point. So we feel good about our chances.  We were also coming off a loss that we had our chances in Game 5 and a couple possessions down the stretch last year we just didn't communicate and they made us pay.  So we like our chances.",
        "14": "I don't know.  I've just been fortunate enough to, I guess, make some shots, for one.  Grab some rebounds, find some teammates.  Guys put the ball in my face and get some blocks, and guys throw some errant passes and I'm able to get some steals.",
        "15": "It's that simple.  It's not easy, but it's that simple.  I just go out and play.  I don't know what happens in elimination games.  I understand the magnitude of it, but it's not -- it doesn't bother me too much.  Just go out, and I know how much I put into the game.  I know how true I am to the game.  I know how much work that I put into the game when no cameras are around and things of that nature.  So I'm able to try to just bottle that, just bottle that and live with the results.  I mean, it's not always been great, but I guess the last few games, elimination games it's been pretty good, and hopefully I can continue that tomorrow. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "For either one of you guys, how did Draymond Green's absence affect you offensively and also defensively?",
        "2": "Last year after Game 5, I think I asked you a question that made significant headlines, and the answer was very controversial.  Does a game like this in which you break crazy records, does it remind you of what inspired you to say that last year?",
        "5": "LeBron, you just mentioned that Kyrie's game tonight was one of the best performances you've ever seen.  And maybe that will affect how you answer this, but how does your game, the way you played tonight, compare with your Boston game from 2012, the 45-15?",
        "6": "Both of you guys have talked all series about trying to play the right way and make sure other guys stay involved.  But I wanted to know, I'm curious, before this game did you guys know going in that it would have to take this, what you guys did, 82 points combined in order to get this win?  Did you know you had to take it to another level?",
        "8": "LeBron, you said this was one of the greatest performances you've ever seen in the Playoffs, and you've seen a lot of them.  Kyrie's only played six games in the NBA Finals.  What was it about his performance that really was epic for you?",
        "10": "You seemed to have the ball in your hands more tonight than you have in quite a while, and Ty told us that was kind of by design.  Why was tonight the right time to go back to that, and why did you want the ball in your hands?",
        "11": "You've obviously played against a lot of -- or been in a lot of venues that have been hostile throughout your career, including the last two games against Toronto.  How was it different tonight and how do you feed off the energy?  Do you enjoy making the crowd go home like that?  How do you feed off that energy?",
        "13": "That's okay.  Maybe a month?",
        "14": "I was just thinking maybe the end of the last three or four weeks of the season.",
        "16": "Obviously, there's plenty of motivation for you guys going in down 3-1, but was there any added fuel extra at all after Klay said what he said yesterday, after Speights tweeting and some of the sniping that was going on yesterday?",
        "17": "LeBron, it seemed like there was a little bit more action with you off the ball than maybe in Game 4.  You had that nice dunk on the backdoor cut.  I was curious if that was in there and what it does to have you moving off the ball as opposed to just holding it?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think from a mental standpoint it wasn't about anybody that was on the floor.  We just had a mindset that we wanted to come in here and just try to extend our period and have another opportunity to fight for another day.  And that was our main concern, and we were able to do that.",
        "2": "Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and as one of the leaders of the team, we just went out and executed.  You've got a guy like this who is very special, it's probably one of the greatest performances I've ever seen live.  To put on the show that he did, you just go out and follow the keys and play winning basketball, and we did that tonight.",
        "5": "I think the main thing is that we were able to give ourselves another chance.  Going into Boston, being down 3-2, you know, we understood that, hey, listen, the season is over if we don't go out and try to take care of business.  Being a big part of our success, I had to come out and do some things to help us win that ballgame, and tonight was just another example of that.  Understood the magnitude of this game.  I knew how great of a team we were playing, but I just had to come out and just -- I know my teammates trust me, I trust them, and that was the result of it.",
        "6": "At this point, it's whatever it takes.  Obviously making shots and things of that nature are something that you sometimes really can't control.  Sometimes the ball go in; sometimes it don't.  How hard you play, how locked in you are on the keys to get a victory, what the coaching staff put out for us.  But he was -- obviously this guy was special, and we rode him to the victory line.",
        "8": "Just calm.  Just calm for 48 minutes.  Obviously he played 40 minutes, but even in the 8 minutes that he was sitting down, he was just calm.  Timely bucket after bucket that led our team.  The fourth quarter, I mean, he hit timely shot after shot after shot when those guys were trying to get back into the game. Defensively he was phenomenal as well, guarding Steph and guarding the rest of those guys, whoever he was matched up on.  They tried to post him a few times with Harrison Barnes, and he just made it tough on him.  Got his hand on the ball a couple times on the post.  He was just locked in on both sides of the floor.  So that's what I saw, and that's why I said what I said.",
        "10": "Well, it's the only time.  I mean, obviously it's do or die for us.  Coach Lue said he wanted the ball in my hands a little bit more.  I finally did a great job of not turning the ball over and got to my spots, got my teammates involved.  Just tried to put us in position to be successful.  Obviously it's not always a bed of roses on the court for 48 minutes, but you just try to go out there and trust your keys.  That's something I'm very comfortable with, and I've been comfortable with before in the past.  Coach wanted to make that adjustment, and I was able to take advantage of it when I had the ball in my hands.",
        "11": "I mean, I guess when you're done with a game of basketball and big moments like tonight and moments throughout your career you wish you could get back.  No matter how loud you turn the stereo system up in your house, you'll never be able to get it back.  You just don't take these moments for granted, no matter if you're at home or on the road.",
        "13": "That would classify as date (smiling). KYRIE IRVING: March, March -- no, I don't know (laughing).  The only thing that really matters is right now.  I'm sorry, I can't answer a specific date or something like that.",
        "14": "I think it was then.  I think it was like as soon as I was coming back to the team, I think we clicked right away. KYRIE IRVING: Yeah, when he announced he was coming back.  I think that's it (laughing).",
        "16": "First of all, I'm not on social media right now, so I don't even know what Speights said, and I really don't think that even matters (laughing).  You guys make me laugh.  I swear, you guys do. My only motivation is my teammates and my coaching staff, especially being in this building.  It's just us, us versus the Warriors.  They have an unbelievable fan base.  So many other things that we have to be challenged about.  So my only motivation is how can I be there for my teammates and my coaching staff.  That's it.  I mean, at the end of the day, nothing else really matters.",
        "17": "Well, I pride myself on not holding the ball as much.  I did that early in my career, and I wasn't very successful.  So I understand how to play efficient basketball. Also, when a guy has it going like Kyrie had it going, I'm able to find cracks and move without the ball and get it with the live dribble and things of that nature.  And all our teammates do a great job of keeping the space, keeping it available for me to cut through the lane and things of that nature.  Just try to be an outlet, an outlet when Kyrie doesn't feel like he has a great look and just try to put pressure on their defense. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "In reference to this whole thing with Draymond Green, the Warriors players seemed concerned or upset about the fact that they said you stepped over him or the other word was straddled him.  Why did you do that?",
        "1": "Well, let me follow up.  Were you aware at the time that you stepped over him?  Was it something that you didn't know that you did, or did you do it intentionally?",
        "2": "After four games you are playing tomorrow an elimination game.  How hard is it for you to be in this situation?",
        "3": "LeBron, when you're playing Draymond or anybody that was in Draymond's situation, how aware are you that he's one flagrant away from a suspension?  Does it affect how you go into a matchup like that?",
        "4": "LeBron, the other night you said you didn't expect the NBA to assess a flagrant.  I believe your answer was:  No, I don't expect them to do it.  Were you surprised by today's decision to assess a flagrant?  And do you think that resulting suspension is fair?  Did you feel like it was a flagrant?",
        "5": "You were pretty upset, obviously, on the court at that moment.  Did you feel like it was a flagrant foul?",
        "6": "You know the history.  You know no team's ever come back from 3-1 in The Finals.  Does this give you guys a little bit of a lift or a spark maybe that you needed?",
        "7": "Just to pick up on your comments there at the end.  Obviously the first two Finals went their way in Oracle.  How do you nullify that away-court issue?",
        "8": "When the Warriors were up here, there was some talk about what trash talk crosses the line and what doesn't.  Klay Thompson said:  I guess he just got his feelings hurt.  You talked about being a prideful guy and some comments Draymond made.  Would you discuss that whole issue of what's fair and not fair on the court?",
        "9": "Yeah, and what crosses the line.",
        "10": "Klay said:  I guess he just got his feelings hurt.",
        "11": "I believe the transcript will support that.",
        "12": "After last game you said you were slightly perplexed about the lack of calls against your defenders when you're playing as aggressive as you are.  Do you think that will change?  Do you expect it to change as the series progressed?",
        "13": "LeBron, you've been involved in the last two playoff series where the team has a 3-1 advantage.  You know, obviously with Miami you got wiped out at San Antonio, and then when you were with Miami before you took it to Oklahoma City.  How do you avoid basically that not happening again when you're around the others?",
        "14": "Especially on the road it's tough because they can steamroll against you too?",
        "15": "I know you were in the middle of The Finals, and maybe a big-picture question doesn't work here, but you wanted to come back to Cleveland for one reason.  And I wonder, having seen this team come together over the last two years and now being healthy and having the run that you had, just the kind of over-arching pressure you continue to feel to try to deliver that with a team that is really I think everything that you wanted and everything that they were able to do for you and how you deal with that facing an elimination game like this?",
        "16": "With your 13 years of experience, as you pointed out earlier, though, does it give you perspective that no matter what I do or how hard I play or the leadership that I show that there may be some years that it just doesn't happen?",
        "17": "How has I guess the line of what's too far in trash talking changed since you've been in the league?  Like what's the line now and what was it then?  Also, I know you and Draymond are friends.  How is your relationship after this?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, first of all, before we get started, I want to -- my condolences goes out to all the lost ones and families in the tragic shooting in Orlando.  I think it's another hit for us as Americans and what we have to deal with in our world today, and it definitely puts things in perspective on basketball.  For myself, it's just a small matter of what reality really is.  So my prayers to all the lost ones and all the ones that are recovering from this morning's tragedy in Orlando. To get to your question, I don't really have an answer to it.  I'm not quite sure what any of the Warriors guys said.  I'm not a disrespectful guy.  I don't disrespect anybody.  It's all in competition, so I don't really have an answer to your question.",
        "1": "I was just trying to get back into the play.  I think what had happened was intentional.  I knew we got into a grapple at the top of the key, but me just trying to get back into the play.  That was my whole mindset.",
        "2": "It's not hard.  I mean, you go out and you give everything that you have to your team and to your teammates, and you live with the results.  I put a lot of hard work into my career and into this year, so I know what I'm capable of doing.  I know what our team is capable of doing.  But it's not hard.  You just go out and do your job.",
        "3": "I think something like that you're unaware.  I didn't even know at that point in time.  But you are aware of what's going on in the game.  You know if a guy has one foul, you know if a guy has two fouls.  You know if a guy has one technical or if a guy's injured or whatever the case may be.  Those things that are happening throughout the course of the game, you notice those things. But you're not -- I've never been aware, okay, if a guy gets one more flagrant or if a guy gets, I don't know, one more penalty point -- I'm not quite sure of all that stuff.  I'm not aware of that.",
        "4": "I think the league handled it as they felt they wanted to handle it, and that's their call.  It's been their call all year.  Us as players, we've got to play on no matter what happens.  You can't -- you can either go with what the league says or you don't, but at the end of the day they make the final decisions.",
        "5": "I felt like at that point in time it was a little bit outside of basketball.",
        "6": "At the end of the day, it doesn't.  For our team, we know how dangerous they are no matter who's in the lineup.  I mean, obviously we saw what they were able to do without Steph for two weeks, playing against Houston and playing against Portland.  Those guys still complement each other, no matter who's out on the floor. So we have to be, obviously, much better than we were in Game 4 in order to try to get a win in a building where they've been very successful.",
        "7": "Well, not many teams have been successful here.  But at the end of the day, we just have to play better.  I think our first two games we had way too many turnovers which resulted in those guys getting out on the break.  I think we averaged 18 turnovers for 25 points in Game 1 to Game 2.  No matter how well you play, that's not good ingredients for a victory on anyone's floor, especially not on the defending champion floor.",
        "8": "What happened?  What Klay said?",
        "9": "No, I'm not -- what did you say Klay said?",
        "10": "(Laughing) Oh, my goodness.",
        "11": "I'm not going to comment on what Klay said, because I know where it can go from this sit-in.  It's so hard to take the high road.  I've been doing it for 13 years.  It's so hard to continue to do it, and I'm going to do it again. At the end of the day, we've got to go out and show up and play better tomorrow night; and if we don't, then they're going to be back-to-back champion, and that's it. But I've taken the high road again.",
        "12": "I can't.  I mean, for me, you control what you control, and that's something that myself and our team can't control.  What we can control is how aggressive we play on both ends of the floor.  Our coaching staff will prepare us the best way to go out and win Game 5, and it's up to us to go out and execute it.",
        "13": "Well, you have to take one possession at a time.  You can't start the first quarter thinking about the third quarter.  You can't start the second quarter thinking about the fourth quarter.  Every possession matters, and especially when you're in a do-or-die game, which it is for us, obviously.  You know, so we've got to just take every possession as the last and move on to the next one as they carry on throughout the game.",
        "14": "This team could steamroll against anybody on any court (laughing), so that's the actualization about it all.",
        "15": "Well, for me, I think from a basketball standpoint, that's one of the reasons why I came back, but it's not the main reason I came back.  It wasn't the only reason I came back, and there wasn't just one reason why I came back. Me personally, what I'm able to do off the floor as well with my foundation and me being back home and me being -- last summer I was able to guarantee all my kids in my program college scholarships.  I'm able to do so many things because I'm actually there, hands on, with my foundation and things that go on.  I'm able to up lift the youth in my community and also in other communities.  Even though you're able to do it from afar, if you're actually there, I think it's even more meaningful to kids that look up to you for inspiration. Then from a basketball standpoint, yeah, I mean, that's always been my goal since I was drafted in 2003.  I was drafted in 2003.  My goal was to bring a championship to Cleveland, and it hasn't changed.  When I left, my goal was to bring a championship to Miami.  That didn't change.  And when I came back, it hasn't changed. So, ever since, for me -- since I went to high school in '99, that's been my goal, since '99, was to win a state championship, to win an NBA Championship.  So that goal has never changed.",
        "16": "Well, at the end of the day you control what you can control.  You dedicate yourself to the game, you be true to the game.  I commit myself to those 14 guys and our coaching staff and our fans every single night that I step on the floor.  At the end of the day, win, lose or draw, I'm not happy, but I'm okay with it because I know I've given all I've got. I don't know if there's anyone that's been in the league and won a championship every single year they've been in the league.  Unless they played one year, won a championship as a rookie and then they retire. One thing I can say that I've been blessed enough to be a part of seven Finals, and hopefully I'll be blessed enough to play in many more even after this year, win, lose or draw.",
        "17": "Well, I don't think that's changed.  I think we all know what's crossing the line no matter if you're playing basketball or if you're playing video games or we're playing catch or you're double-dutching it.  I mean, we know what's crossing the line.  We know what words cross the line, male or female.  And ever since Draymond came into the league, I've been someone that he can always talk to and things of that nature.  But he crossed the line last game.  He felt like I crossed the line.  We said what we had to say.  So we're in a competitive series right now, and I think right now friendship is the last thing we're thinking about. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, Steph hit the three, and it was like 5:55 left in the fourth quarter, and you guys called a timeout.  You guys came out of timeout.  Can you talk about if that was exactly what you guys wanted?  It seemed like after that the offense kind of sputtered. Le",
        "1": "They went up nine.  They went up nine at that point. Le",
        "2": "What is your mindset heading into the next game? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, you had words with Draymond and Steph.  What kind of got you going and what were you saying to them? Le",
        "4": "Anything with Steph? Le",
        "5": "I think you had four free throws tonight the entire game.  Just your thoughts on that and some of the calls tonight? Le",
        "6": "I do have a question for Kyrie, too, but I wanted to follow up with Draymond.  LeBron, I think you've seen it now, he got you in the groin during that.  Especially given Draymond's situation with the flagrants and whatnot, do you have any opinion on what happened there, what should happen? Le",
        "7": "Do you expect that the league -- whether or not you think they should, do you expect that they would? Le",
        "9": "LeBron, what do you tell yourself the next two-and-a-half days?  And what do you tell your guys the next two-and-a-half days when you know the enormity now with the chips stacked against you? Le",
        "11": "For either of you guys, did you feel the fatigue played a factor at all in this game? Le",
        "12": "LeBron, for you, you and Kyrie combined for 33 of the 38 shot attempts in the second half.  Is that a number that you're comfortable with in a game? Le",
        "13": "For both of you guys, the story of the first three games in large part was how Curry was having trouble affecting the games, he sort of got loose from you guys tonight.  What did you both see that they did so successful compared to the other three games? Le",
        "14": "Beginning of the fourth quarter you guys are up by two points.  They go on a big run and rip off a 12-1 run.  You guys sort of, it was like you were playing in quicksand a little bit there.  What was the experience like as that's sort of starting to happen for you?  What was changing for them that was making it more difficult for you to get stops? Le",
        "16": "LeBron, from Game 1 you talked about turnovers.  You got a couple of high-turnover games, this one included.  But you just talked about the referees.  Do you believe some of those turnovers are being called because you're not getting the calls or is it something else that's going on? Le",
        "17": "You guys got Kevin Love back tonight, and he talked about being accepting of his role coming off the bench.  I wonder what impact you felt that had getting him back in the lineup, and how that might help you guys going forward? Le"

        "0": "I don't know.  I'm trying to replay it back.  I'm not quite sure what we ran out of timeout.",
        "1": "Yeah, I'm not sure what we ran out the timeout when we came back out on the floor.  But our offense did stall a little bit in the fourth quarter.  We played a little bit too much random, trying to dribble drive, get guys looks, and then we started settling a little bit for the three-point shot when we kind of got down.  Which obviously we've got to do a better job of that. But we had our chances.  I think the third quarter was a momentum swing for us, and they took advantage of it.",
        "2": "My mindset is get one.  You know, we've got to go out there and play obviously better than we played tonight.  Better than even we played in Game 3.  But we've got to get one.  It's not about overlooking this.  It's about getting one on their home floor where they've been very successful.  So, you know, we've got to come in with the mindset that our coaching staff is going to give us a great game plan and we've got to execute that.  We're about the results after.",
        "3": "Oh, nothing got me going.  You know, Draymond just said something that I don't agree with.  I'm all cool with the competition.  I'm all fine with that, but some of the words that came out of his mouth were a little bit overboard, and being a guy with pride, a guy with three kids and a family, things of that nature, some things just go overboard and that's where he took it, and that was it.",
        "4": "No, no.  That conversation was competitive conversation.  I'm okay with that.",
        "5": "Well, it's been like that all year for the most part.  I'm not quite sure what I can do personally to get to the free-throw line, but I've got to continue to be aggressive for our team.  I'm getting hit, but the refs are not seeing it that way, on my drives.  But I've got to continue to be aggressive for our team.  That's who I am, that's what opens up the floor for a lot of our shooters, and just worry about the results afterwards. You know, it's tough playing 46 minutes and only going to the line four times, as much as I attack the rim.  So it's just a tough situation for our team.",
        "6": "Well, I don't know what should happen.  It's not my call.  That's the league office.  They'll take a look at it.  We all saw it in the locker room.  You know, like I said, as a competitor, I love going against Draymond, and I'm all about going out there and leaving it out on the floor.  But when it gets a little bit more than what it should be, that's what caused me to have words with him. So as far as the play, I think the league will take a look at it.  Obviously our locker room has seen it, and we'll see what they say.",
        "7": "No.",
        "9": "Obviously, if you want to look to that side, then you put too much pressure on yourself.  I think for me as the leader of this team, we've just got to get one.  Let's get one.  We've already got to take a flight home back anyways, so we might as well come home with a win and play on our home floor again.  Being a confident bunch we feel like the chips have been stacked up against us all year anyway. So we've got to learn from our mistakes tonight, which we made some and we go out with the mindset let's get one and then bring it home.",
        "11": "No.  Not at all. KYRIE IRVING: No excuses.",
        "12": "Well, we've got to be aggressive.  Our coach, Coach Lue told us to be aggressive.  And obviously, we don't like to hear it in that form.  We want to get our guys involved and keep our guys in a good rhythm.  I just think it was just the way the game played out tonight.",
        "13": "Well, first of all, he's a great player, and we know that.  And we knew he was going to come out and be aggressive.  Because of how the first three games went, and we knew he was going to be aggressive. We made some mistakes and he made us pay for them.  He made us pay every time we made a mistake defensively, and he shot the ball extremely well from the three-point line.  We tried to keep a body on him when he went to the paint, where he struggled a little bit, but when he went to the three-point line, he made us pay.",
        "14": "They started making shots and then they started getting stops.  They did it on both sides of the floor.  It starts with, I believe, Harrison Barnes'  three at the top of the key.  That was a big shot to kind of get their rhythm going.  Then they got some offensive rebounds, some second-chance points and then defensively they got stops.",
        "16": "I didn't talk about the referees.  I was asked a question and I answered it.  I'm going to save my 25K, okay.  So I have not talked about the referees.  Don't put me in that cloud.  I haven't been solid with the basketball.  A lot of it is making plays not only for myself but for my teammates. Some of my aggression turnovers I'm okay with.  I think I had two careless ones.  One came at the end of the game where Steph picked it off.  Another one came early in the third quarter where Bogut trapped the box and I tried to hit Double T.  Draymond stepped in front of it.  But some of them were attack turnovers.  Trying to squeeze the ball into tight places as a quarterback would, and I'm okay with those.  But some of those that are careless, I'm not okay with that.",
        "17": "Well, for two years, any time we've gotten anyone back from injury or sickness or whatever, it's been a boost for our team, and tonight was another one.  I mean, getting them back, seeing him out on the floor and him making the impact, especially in the first half when he hit a couple shots, he was able to get a layup off a offensive rebound.  He started the fourth on a post-up, that was a big play for us. So I know he probably felt out of rhythm.  It was a different situation for him that he hasn't experienced in quite a few years.  But anytime we get someone back from injury or anything, it's a boost for our team. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, I'm just curious, when you found out Kevin wasn't playing and that you were going to basically be defending Draymond last night, what approach and what did you set out to do mostly against him? Le",
        "1": "Even though you say you approach it as a big, he initiates so much of their offense from well above the three-point arc.  It looked like you made it a priority to get way up on him, even way above the arc.  How do you think that affected their offense or helped you guys from an aggressive standpoint defensively? Le",
        "2": "Last night, LeBron, you talked about how a lot of the things that Richard Jefferson does doesn't show up in the stat sheet.  Can you just elaborate on what those intangibles are and what you're seeing out on the court that kind of helped you guys with your rhythm and play last night? Le",
        "3": "I'd like to follow up on Draymond before I ask my own question:  You're always such a game-plan guy.  You'll do whatever it is that Ty lays out.  But when you have a night like last matching up with Draymond, and it worked out as well as it did for you and the club, would that be a situation where you'd go to Ty and say, leave this matchup alone? Le",
        "4": "Prior to last night the Warriors had beaten you guys seven in a row, did that at any point start to build up kind of a mental block for your team?  And when you win one, when you snap a streak like that, what can it do from a confidence level going against a team like the Warriors? Le",
        "5": "What have you learned about this team, the makeup of the locker room that lets you know that you might be able to handle any changes that potentially come to the lineup if Kevin is able to play on Friday night? Le",
        "6": "LeBron, how important is it for the collective when Steph is around the lane or cutting under the basket, making a baseline cut, just within the letter of the law of course, making sure he feels you guys in some way?  How much has that been a point of emphasis for you guys?  Because it seems like last night was more so for 1 and 2. Le",
        "7": "And you talked before 3 for obvious reasons about do or die.  Now that it's 2-1 and you won a game by 30 or whatever it was last night, how do you keep that same edge? Le",
        "8": "LeBron, Tyronn shared a story with us that both you and Kyrie went up to Kevin before the game last night and said, \"We've got to win this one for you.\"  What's it been like noticing the frustration he's dealing with with the protocol, and also, what can you do to support him throughout this process? Le",
        "9": "You said a couple days ago you really didn't know what playing possessed meant.  But I think like Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals with Heat against the Celtics, I think you went 45 and 16, and you kind of looked like you were in a different state of mind that night.  Was there any comparison between that night, if you look back to last night, and how you'll approach tomorrow? Le",
        "10": "Were you in a different state of mind that night four years ago that you've been since, or was that just a great game? Le",
        "11": "What does Ty bring to the team as a coach that's unique and special?  And why do the players like him so much? Le",
        "12": "LeBron, when you decided to come back here, how prepared do you think Kyrie as a No. 1 draft pick and franchise guy was prepared?  How prepared do you think he was for any changes in his role or the pecking order?  And now that you have been back and seeing him up close for two years as opposed to an interested observer, what adjustments have you seen? Le",
        "13": "You probably would have welcomed it, but when you were a young player, if you'd had a multiple All-Star, one of the best in the game dropped in your lap.  What sort of a challenge would that have been for you? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, it's a different mindset when you know you're starting off on the perimeter compared to when you're starting off on a big.  You have to change your mind frame.  You have to change mentally, actually thinking as a big, and that was my mindset.  When I knew Kevin wasn't playing and Coach said I was starting on Draymond, I had to transition myself into being a big and guarding a big and getting into the scuffle and things of that nature. So it's just a different approach, which I'm fine by making that transition.",
        "1": "Well, I think not only myself, but everyone.  Everyone extended their defense a little bit more.  They're such a great three-point shooting team that you have to extend your defense to start off with.  More than that, they move the ball so, so well.  And Draymond being one of those guys, one of their playmakers along with Steph, along with Livingston, along with Iguodala that makes so many great passes above that, well beyond the three-point line. So, you've got to do a good job of trying to help the back-line defense by putting a little ball pressure on them.",
        "2": "He's a professional.  He's a true professional, and a guy who is seizing an opportunity and moment to be in this position.  The last time he was in The Finals was his first and second year in the league, and I think he's not taking this moment for granted.  He's just going out and giving everything that he has. He knows his role.  He plays it very well, and he's key to our team.",
        "3": "Well, myself and Coach Lue, we talk a lot about game plan, and at the end of the day he has the last say so.  And then it's for me to go relay it to the rest of the group and get those guys to buy in on what needs to be done to help us win. So we have a lot of conversations throughout the whole year on what should we do and how we can be better as a ballclub, and he would give his last decision.  Then it's for me to go and take it to the team and make sure they're prepared.",
        "4": "I don't think anyone actually knew the number or how many consecutive times they had beaten us.  We just knew they had beat us in Game 1 and Game 2, and they beat us pretty well on their home floor.  We wanted to just come out with a better effort, sustain a better effort as close to 48 minutes as possible and live with the results. But I don't think anyone in our locker room actually knew how many times they had beat us in a row.",
        "5": "Well, in the last two years we've had some extreme situations happen to us, both with two of our All-Stars being out because of injury.  At the start of this season, obviously with Shump being out and also Kyrie being out for a long extended period of time, so guys have been able to just -- \"next man up\", that's always been our motto.  For someone that's out and can't perform or can't play at that point in time, then it's next man up.  Our coaching staff does a great job of keeping everybody engaged, keeping everybody afloat or understanding, hey, you never know what may happen, so always be ready.  So that allows our team to be able to make the adjustment on the fly, if need be.",
        "6": "Well, I think, that's for all of their guys, not just Steph.  They do a great job of the ball moving, and when you allow those guys to move with freedom of space, they're very dangerous.  They're already dangerous enough.  So when you allow them to run around and not feel any pressure or any physicality or anything, you know, they're able to just be even more comfortable. They're already a great team, and you just want to try to take something away from it because of how well they move the ball and how well they share the ball and how great of three-point shooters that Steph and Klay are, and the rest of those guys feed off of them.",
        "7": "It's the same.  It's the same mindset.  We can't afford to go down 3-1 and go into their building and give them confidence going back.  So it's a do-or-die game for us still.",
        "8": "Well, I just seen it on his face yesterday when we were all in the locker room, and it was that I-hate-that-I'm-going-through-this moment.  I-feel-like-I'm-letting-you-guys-down moment without him actually even saying it.  So before we left the locker room, I know Kyrie embraced him, I did as well.  Told him, don't worry about it.  We've got him tonight.  This is what a team is all about for them to pick their brother up in a time of need, and him not to put too much pressure on himself or the team, and that we're going to try to take care of business, which we were able to do. So I know it was uplifting to him, for sure, and it was for our team as well.",
        "9": "I think for me it's just I just play my game.  I love to play the game.  And obviously being down 3-2 in Boston at that point in time, it was do or die.  I mean, it was year two for us, and we had already lost the previous year, and we had so many high hopes that year, and being down 3-2 going into Boston, it was a tough situation for us. So just try to go out there and play the game that I love to play, trust the work I've put into it and let the chips fall where they may, and I did the same thing last night.",
        "10": "I wasn't in a different state of mind.  I was just focused like I always am.  I was focused on what the job at hand.  I play the game with a lot of joy and a lot of fun.  A camera can always catch you doing anything and they can always put a caption on it all the time.  So, you know, that's one of the pictures that came out kind of saw me bent over and just looking at one of my teammates shooting free throws, and it said, he looks like a man possessed, and I don't even remember what I was thinking about.",
        "11": "For one, he just brings a sense of calmness no matter the situation.  Just like he came in here before Game 3 and told you guys we're not worried about being down 0-2.  We're back on our home floor and we look forward to going out and playing our best basketball.  When you have that from the general, you know, for us, we go out there and follow his command. Also he's one of the few coaches in our league or he's one of the few coaches in our league that you can relate to because he has some of the same upbringings as some of us.  Growing up in the inner city, single-parent household, being a statistic, so I can relate to him a lot.  Just understanding how the odds are always built up against you growing up and you make it.  So at this point everything else is kind of extra credit because you've already succeeded in life.  So everything else is extra credit, so you can relate to that as a player to a coach.",
        "12": "I don't think anyone was prepared for me returning and understanding what the situation was going to entail.  I mean, that's everyone here.  You know, they had gone through some losing seasons in my previous stint before I came back, so they knew they were getting a pretty good basketball player and a great leader and a good person, and someone that was going to command excellence.  But I don't know if they understood the day-to-day process of being in this situation was going to entail. So it's been a learning experience for everyone that's been a part of it to this point, and including myself.  I've actually learned some things as well about the guys and about how to be patient with younger guys and things of that nature. But if I could look at the first day I returned to now, our floor general, Kyrie, has become such a great leader.  Every single day he's learning, every day.  And last night was a prime example of that, him going out and playing the way he did, commanding the way he did, getting guys involved the way he did.  You know, that's just a true testament of someone who has a growth mindset and being able to grow every single day under these circumstances.",
        "13": "Oh, I'd play with anybody.  I don't really care.  I can play with anybody.  I can play with multiple All-Stars.  I can play with young guys.  I can play with older guys.  It would have been great to get a multiple All-Star, someone who had done something in our league to come to this team when I was a young guy to kind of help me along the way as well.  But it didn't happen, so I had to learn on my own. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "2": "LeBron, for somebody who understands the history of the game as well as you do, best two teams in basketball in theory.  How do you equate losing by 30 and winning by 30 in such short order?  Especially when you're whole to start one game, and then not whole with Kevin in the locker room, how do you make sense of the 63-point turnaround? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, for a couple days you had talked about needing to compete harder and play harder, effort.  Ty just said the same thing.  In a Finals, how can that be the issue?  Do you feel like your guys have gotten over it? Le",
        "5": "So much was made of the narrative of the second units and the difference of the contributions.  Now you win a Game 120-90.  But the first unit, you guys went 105-57.  How do you make sense of that kind of dominance between the starting lineups against that team?  Offense, defense, can you describe what the key is there to win by 50 points? Le",
        "8": "LeBron, tonight I think you started 4-of-4 and then you struggled and got it going in the second half.  Can you take us through your roller coaster shooting, and what got you going again in that second half, especially with your jumper? Le",
        "10": "LeBron how different is this team when it gets a contribution like it did tonight from Jump Shot Jesus over here? Le",
        "11": "There was a play after the whistle where Steph was trying to go up and do a lay-up or a dunk I guess to try to get it him rhythm and you blocked his shot.  Was that a way to set the tone that there wasn't going to be any easy shots tonight?  And can you talk a little bit about how much better your defensive communication was tonight. Le",
        "13": "How much did you playing in the post tonight change the dynamic of this game?  And what was your approach to Draymond? Le",
        "14": "How much did you guys change defensively what you wanted to do?  It looked like you weren't switching as much as you were in the first two. Le",
        "15": "You've heard it from us over the last couple days of asking you if you're going to take over this game, if you're going to do this or do that.  When it was official that Kevin Love was going to be out for this game, did you have to change your approach at all going into this game or you pretty much played like yourself? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "2": "At the end of the day, no matter if you lose by 30 or 1, it's just one win.  And you have to be able to have a short mind but also learn from the mistakes that you made the previous game and just try to better yourself in the following game.  And that's what we're able to do.  We had a great shootaround yesterday.  We had a great shootaround this morning.  Coach Lue and the coaching staff gave us a great game plan and it was just up to us to go out and execute that, and I think we did that tonight.",
        "3": "Don't think it's an issue.  You know, it's just something that we wanted to pinpoint and do better.  You could say we wanted to move the ball better the next game.  We want to dribble-drive the next game.  Those are not issues.  Those are things that we want to be better at in the next game, and I think we did that tonight.",
        "5": "Well, they're a great team and they have a great starting lineup, and they have great complementary players that come off the bench.  It's never about us versus their starting five.  It's about the whole 15 group.  Our 15 guys versus their 15 guys and who can execute as close to 48 minutes as possible. We did a great job, and I gave the game ball to RJ.  Getting the start tonight with Kevin being out, he just came in with so much aggression, so much attention to detail.  He was on the glass.  He gave us eight rebounds and nine points.  But some of the things that he was doing out on the floor did not show up in the boxscore. So we just want to try to play our game.  We finally got back to our game tonight, and it started with the floor general to my left.  The sharpshooter to my right got it going, and it was just good basketball.  It was a good flow, and everyone felt like they were a part of tonight's win.  So it was just a collective team win.  It wasn't about us versus their starting five.  It was just about how everyone can get the job done whoever is on the floor.",
        "8": "My teammates got me going.  They told me to be aggressive, and that's what I was.",
        "10": "Well, I mean, he's like you said, he's a two-way player.  Defensively all year long that's what he's been doing.  The offense comes very free to him and very easy, but the defensive side is what's making him so great.  The contribution that we got from him from the scoring was all predicated on what he did defensively, you know, and he got in great rhythm.  He hit some huge shots for us tonight, obviously, but I think it all started on the defensive end where he was much better than he was offensively.",
        "11": "Oh, well, when you have the greatest shooter in the world trying to get an easy one or trying to get in rhythm, it's our job to try to keep him out.  No matter if it's after the whistle or not.  That was just my mindset.  Anytime, if you're a great player and you see the ball go in, no matter if it's after the play or during the play, then you start feeling it.  Not that you feel good because you know what you're capable of, but it helps.  So I didn't want him to see the ball go in, even though he still made some.",
        "13": "Well, I mean, I just wanted to play a little bit inside and outside.  I started off the game going in the interior and just trying to fan out their defense a little bit.  We did a great job of spacing out with RJ, with Ky, and also with Swish, so it gave me a little bit more room to work down in the post. I missed a ton of chippies, but I was loving the space that I was getting and my teammates created for me.  So just kind of following the game plan.  It's something that we wanted to do tonight and were able to execute it.",
        "14": "Coaching staff gave us a game plan and we went out and executed it.",
        "15": "No, I didn't change my approach, and I didn't take over this game.  Kyrie pretty much took over the game, especially early and late.  He closed the game out.  He started the game, and I just sprinkled in, you know, my production along the whole game. He took the game over, I guess, from that standpoint.  I just try to lead these guys to victory.

      "questions": {
        "0": "Just wanted to ask, in light of Steph Curry pulling out of the Olympics yesterday, I wondered, one, if you've made any sort of decision on that yet, the series not being over?  And two, what will be the key factors that go into the consideration of whether you would play in the Olympics one way or the other? Le",
        "1": "Ty said after Game 2 that you guys need to be more physical defensively, kind of alluding to the style you played last year.  Is this team capable of playing that style again, and why, what was working defensively last year that is not working now? Le",
        "2": "LeBron, everyone always says bench players, the role players play better at home.  Besides that and familiarity, sleeping in your own bed, what goes into the homecourt advantage?  You guys are unbeaten so far, they had their way out there. Le",
        "3": "LeBron, I asked Coach Lue if there's anything that you could do to improve your game moving into Game 3, and one of the things he said is just be more aggressive.  When you're more aggressive, what does that entail in your game? Le",
        "4": "Is there anything specific? Le",
        "5": "Kevin's been such a big part of this postseason for you guys.  How do things change if you can't go tomorrow night and beyond? Le",
        "6": "It's been a long time since you've been down 0-2 in the series, but the last two times, one was against the Pistons in '07 and you guys came back and won that, and the other one was the Celtics the next year and you forced a Game 7.  Do you rely at all on those two experiences as you approach this 0-2 deficit?  What is it?  How do you climb out of an 0-2 hole? Le",
        "7": "One of these days you're going to (inaudible). Le",
        "8": "Do you guys need more three-point makes and attempts?  Is it necessary?  What can be done to maybe free up some shots at the three-point line? Le",
        "9": "This is a bit off the beaten path, but I know you made some dietary changes a couple years ago to make your game better, to slim down.  We saw the pictures.  What kind of things do you have to avoid?  And what is the hardest thing after the game that you reach for that you can't end up having? Le",
        "10": "What are we talking, Cheetos, Doritos? Le",
        "11": "When the Raptors tied the series at two last round, you said there was no need to panic.  You've been in a lot of adverse situations and you said that wasn't one of them at that time.  The Warriors, they just took care of home court, but it seemed like the way they did it and the size and their advantage, does this qualify as an adverse period?  And if so, how does that change what you say to the team or approach? Le",
        "12": "With the way Golden State plays on offense, do you think if you guys played better on offense that could help your defense just with the rebounds and such? Le",
        "13": "Phil Jackson commented on the NBA Finals yesterday, and he said he coached Michael in a series in '93 when the Bulls were down 2-0 to the Knicks and he played like a man possessed in order to bring the team back.  Do you have to get yourself to a different level mentally?  Does the idea of being a man possessed, could that help you turn the series around? Le",
        "14": "It's just common sense that guys like you who touch the ball every trip, you're going to turn it over from time to time obviously.  I mean you beat yourself up pretty good after the game Sunday night.  How quickly did it take you to turn the page off that?  When you went back and studied it, was it something you chalked up to the way they were playing you or were there some things that you wish you had back? Le"

      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, I'm just now hearing about Steph pulling out.  But my decision has never been on anyone either playing on the team or being invited or not playing.  I haven't made a decision yet, and I probably will make it right after the season's over.",
        "1": "Well, I haven't looked at last year's postseason.  A lot of things have changed from last year, a lot of different circumstances, a lot of different rotations have changed.  But if that's what Coach Lue wants us to do, and we have to follow his game plan, and we have to do it.  If guys are out there not following the game plan, then he has to sub them out, and other guys have to come in and do what he wants to do.  He's the commander, and we've got to go out there and do it.",
        "2": "We're a confident bunch especially at home, definitely our role players have given us a huge boost throughout this postseason.  Not only on the road, but especially at home, our fans have done a great job of giving us everything and it's our job to kind of give it back to them.  So I know the guys are excited about the opportunity to get back out there tomorrow night and defend home court as we've done so far in this postseason.",
        "3": "Well, for me, I try to do whatever it takes to help our team win, and I do everything offensively, defensively, getting guys involved, rebounding, everything, so my game doesn't waver one way or the other.  I'm not a pure scorer.  I'm not an all-assist guy.  I'm not just a rebounder.  I do everything.  So for me I said that after Game 2 that I've got to play better, but as far as my numbers, I don't worry about that.",
        "4": "Nothing specific.  I've just got to go out there and play better.",
        "5": "It's going to be the next man up.  We're down 0-2, and we can't afford to look and say, \"Wow, Kev's not playing.  What are we going to do?\"  It's next man up, because it's a must-win for us. So obviously his health is very important, but in the situation we're in now, we've got to stay confident.  And whoever Coach decides to give the nod to got to be ready to go, and everybody else has to step up.",
        "6": "I don't know.  I don't really think about past experiences too much.  This moment is what it is today.  You do a great job of taking me back.  You love my history.  You always take me back and make me go back (smiling).",
        "7": "When I'm done we can talk about the history of it.  But I'm the leader of this team, and we have other guys that are ready to step up.  Obviously, it's a do-or-die game for us.  We can't afford to go down 3-0 to any team, especially a team that's 73-9 in the regular season and playing the type of basketball they're playing.  So it's a do-or-die game for us, and we understand that. So we're going to come in and give everything that we've got and leave it on the floor.",
        "8": "Well, I think being aggressive, getting into the paint.  Then if we can make a couple shots at the rim, which we have not been so successful with in this two-game series so far, it will start opening up our guys on the perimeter.  So myself, and Kyrie and hopefully Kevin, we can attract some more defenders and get some bodies off some of our shooters, we can allow those guys to get open.  But they've done a great job, and I know it's a game plan of those guys to take away our three-point shooters.  They've seen what we've done so far in the postseason.  They've done a great job of slowing them down so far.",
        "9": "Well, I think right now it's not as strict as it's been in the past.  But obviously when you get to a point in your career where you know what benefits you more than others, then you're able to stay away from it, and it's very difficult being in a household with three kids where there's a lot of junk food around and things of that nature and they're running around and putting it in your face.  It's very difficult.  Every now and then I'll dab with them a little bit.  Either, I say to make them happy, but it's actually making me happy (laughing).",
        "10": "I don't want to talk specifics unless they want to -- if I say it, then I've got to get a phone call from one of them (laughing).",
        "11": "I think Game 1 we played good basketball.  They just took care of business for 12 minutes and took us out the game, and that was the fourth quarter.  Game 2 for two-and-a-half quarters they pretty much did what they wanted to do.  So for about four quarters of two games they've played some great basketball.  They've played as great as I've seen them play, which is not always -- you wish you were not on the other side of that.  But I don't think it's an adverse moment, but I would say that we all can sit here and say there is no way we can go down 3-0, you know.  And I'm not a big history guy, even though I love the history of the sport, but I don't like to put myself in it.  But coming back home and understanding this is our home floor and we've played some really good basketball, we can't afford to go down 3-0, especially against this team. So it will be more adversity if we got to that point, which I don't believe we will.",
        "12": "Yeah, of course.  If we can score a little bit more, which I believe we will do in Game 3, that will help our defense out a lot, too.  When you miss versus those guys it gives them the ability to get out and run, which they're very good at.  Either from Draymond pushing the break or Iguodala pushing the break or Steph and those guys run the floor and they run to their spots and create a lot of problems.  So if they're taking the ball out of bounds, then it slows it up just a little bit.  So we've got to do a better job of putting the ball in the basket.",
        "13": "I mean, what does that actually mean?  I mean, I think for me to go out and be who I am and play as true to the game and as hard as I can and try to lead this team, that's who I am.  Not anybody else.  I'm not Michael.  I'm not Ali.  I'm not nobody else that's done so many great things for sport.  I am who I am, and if I'm able to go out and put together a game like that, it wasn't because I was possessed.  It's because I worked on my craft all season long and that's the result of it. Phil's a great coach.  Mike's a great player.  But I am who I am.",
        "14": "It was a little bit of both.  I watched the game as soon as I got on the bus.  First time in a while I caught the first bus leaving the arena.  And myself and James Jones sat next to each other on the bus and watched the game, all the way to the hotel back to San Francisco.  And I seen some of them that were uncharacteristic, but some of them were being aggressive, and they just got their hands on a few of them.  A couple of them were bad footwork; I traveled and a few of the third-quarter moves where I just took an extra step and wasn't as sound with my footwork.  So that's something I can clean up. So, you know, I'm out there making plays for myself and making plays for my teammates as well.  So you're going to have some turnovers, but some of them I can clean up for sure.  So out of the seven, I would say four of them I can clean up and stop those guys from getting out on the break and doing what they do best, and that's filling the lanes and sharing the ball.  I'll be much better and much more sound tomorrow night. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "At this point, are you frustrated or disappointed with your team, with the performance after Game 1 and 2?",
        "1": "I realize you're a team player, but is there a point where you say I have to be more selfish to help my team out in this series?",
        "2": "Just following up on the turnover situation.  You guys didn't have any turnovers in the first quarter, and you held them to 19 points.  Do you feel one of the key things to get this turned around at home is if you can keep those turnovers down you can slow down the game, and, like you said, keep them out of transition?",
        "3": "You gave your squad headphones before the game today with an inspirational quote.  What was your message to them and did they receive it?",
        "4": "Last year with all the injuries and the adversity and the odds, you know, you guys just gutted your way to two wins.  Now you've got -- until Kevin went down, but otherwise everybody was healthy, and Ty Lue's here and everything.  Most of the buttons he had pushed had been working.  Is there a sense that maybe you guys are just let down because of what you've done through all these Playoffs just isn't working?",
        "5": "LeBron, the last couple months you guys are the team they've been talking about, how different you guys are.  You're different, you're not the team from last year this season.  In these last two games in particular, has it been that you guys have slipped and fallen from what has made you different, or is it something the Warriors have done to take away what you guys have established?",
        "6": "After the 2014 Finals, I remember you were asked was that the best team you've ever faced, and you said, yeah, I'd agree with that.  Have these Warriors changed your mind on that?",
        "7": "You are shouldering some of the blame for this and say you didn't live up to the way you like to play.  How do you process a loss when you do feel like it could be part of your fault versus maybe it's out of your control?  What are the next couple days going to be like for you?",
        "8": "Draymond Green has never scored more than 16 points against you guys in a Finals game until tonight.  What was it about everything that happened in that game that made Draymond such a force at both ends of the floor tonight?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Neither.  I'm not disappointed in our guys or frustrated.  We've just got to do a better job.  We've got to be better at all facets of the game both offensively and defensively, both physically and mentally. They just beat us at every -- we didn't win anything.  No points of the game did we beat them in anything.  Even when we had an early lead, they beat us to 50-50 balls, they got extra possessions, they got extra tip-ins.  They beat us pretty good tonight.",
        "1": "Selfish is probably the wrong term.  I got myself in a lot of trouble tonight personally.  Turned the ball over way too much.  And I said after Game 1 we just can't turn the ball over against a great team and expect to win, and I had basically half of the turnovers.  We had some in the fourth quarter, but we had our third group in.  They had some.  But I had half of the turnovers when I came out, and it resulted in them getting some easy baskets. So I've got to be better.  I've got to be better with the ball.  You know, trying to play make for myself and play make for my teammates at the same time, I've just got to be more solid.",
        "2": "Well, that's one of them.  That's one way to slow them down a little bit.  You're able to set your defense.  The game kind of broke open when we had two straight turnovers.  I think game was at 28-22, I turned the ball over.  Draymond got it and was able to hit I think Livingston for a dunk.  And then we had another turnover and Klay hit a three, and that kind of slowed us down.  Even though we were still getting back in the game, it just slowed us down from that point on.  We had the lead, and it started with my turnover, and I can't just be careless with the ball, especially in the paint where a lot of reaching and things of that nature happen. So 18 turnovers once again for 26 points, I think it was 17 for 25 in Game 1.  It's just not good basketball.",
        "3": "I give my teammates stuff throughout the whole year.  All the time.  It's no different.  We understand the moment that we're in, and it's not -- it's not every year that you get an opportunity to be in this situation, you know?  And some of the guys on our team, it's their first time and they've waited their whole life to get to this point. So we know we've got to just do a little bit better.  We've got to play better.  We've got to play a lot better in order to get this series turned around.  I know the other side is looking forward to coming to our building where they had a lot of success last year, so we've got to bear down.",
        "4": "We've got to get back to the film and we all have to figure out ways we can help the team be successful.  It's hard for me to kind of pinpoint what's not working and what could work right now.  Obviously not much is working, especially offensively.  Defensively we've been good at times and then at times we just looked like, okay, we're a step slow.  We messed up on the coverage.  We don't get back or we're just one step behind where we should be.  We should be closer to our man.  When you're behind these guys, they make you pay every single time. We can't have as many mental lapses.  More on the physical, it's a lot of mental as well.  These guys put you in so many mental positions where you have to figure it out, and they make you pay for it when you don't.",
        "5": "What we've done these last two games doesn't put a damper or a cloud over how we got to this point.  We're still here and we have a chance to turn this series around if we come in and do what we need to do both offensively and defensively.  So I'm not worried about that side or what the conversations may be about.  Internally we have to figure out how we can be better.  We have to figure out how we can help one another.  We definitely have to figure out how we can get more guys involved.  15 assists, it's not winning basketball, especially versus this team.  We've just got to figure it out.  Coaching staff will give us a game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute it.",
        "6": "2014 is something I haven't even thought about.  This is a great team, and I stated that before the series ever started.  They've got two of the best shooters that we've ever seen, and they're a great team.  So I've already stated that.",
        "7": "The next couple days will be not -- I won't be reflecting.  I'll figure out ways I can be better, starting as soon as I leave this podium.  Probably go back to the room and watch the game, re-watch for ways I could have been better.  I had a lot of uncharacteristic unforced turnovers which resulted in those guys getting 26 points off turnovers.  So I'm one of the guys who kind of always wants to shoulder the blame and take the blame when we don't play as well as we should.  It's just who I am, and I've got to be better.",
        "8": "He made shots.  Give credit where credit is due.  The guy made shots.  Not only when we left him open and contested late, but he made shots in our face.  He had five threes.  And we know he's a key for their team, we all know that, an All-Star for their team.  And he made some big plays both offensively and defensively, obviously.  We know what he does defensively for that team, so game ball to him. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "In what way do you tie the avenue for athletes to become global icons to Muhammad Ali?",
        "1": "Do you at all see a sense of debt or maybe see the groundwork that he laid for athletes to become global brands, the world renowned that comes for people in your position today, to what degree do you tie that to Muhammad Ali?",
        "2": "Again a little bit on Ali, you touched on the courage he had to show to take stands.  You've had some taste of that.  You've made your feelings known on some pretty touchy issues.  What is that like to kind of put yourself out there like that and should athletes do more of it?  Some do, some don't.  Michael made his -- he made it a point of not doing that at times.",
        "3": "LeBron, you were one of the players that spoke out about the injustice about Trayvon Martin when you were a member of the Miami Heat.  Can you talk about the legacy, the type of legacy that Muhammad Ali will leave on this Earth?",
        "4": "We appreciate your words.  But changing a little bit the subject and going back to the series.  When it comes to a situation to fight back, let's forget about the numbers.  Let's forget about the stats.  What is the recipe for success going into tomorrow's game?",
        "5": "Kyrie was already a pretty good player when you got here.  In what ways the last two years and what direction have you kind of tried to push him to become a more complete player?  And where do you think he is in that process?",
        "6": "He was a scorer, had to be a scorer early on when you get here.  Did you try to emphasize passing more, ball movement more?",
        "7": "Staying on Kyrie, a lot has been made about this series, the matchup between you and Steph Curry, but he actually plays the same position as Steph.  Have you had conversations with him or counsel with him about embracing that challenge, that matchup, but, again, as you mentioned, kind of staying in the team game?",
        "8": "What's your relationship with Dan Gilbert like this year and since you've been back in Cleveland?",
        "9": "You're one of the lower guys on the totem pole?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Can you kind of clarify that question a little bit more?",
        "1": "First of all, my condolences goes to the Ali family.  Rest his soul to the goat.  I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly how you wanted to, but so many thoughts come to mind when I think about the man who passed away yesterday, what he represented. As a kid I gravitated towards him because he was a champion, but I only knew as a kid of what he did inside the ring.  As I got older and I started to be more knowledgeable about the sport, about sport in general and about the guys who paved the way for guys like myself, I understood that he is the greatest of all time, and he was the greatest of all time because of what he did outside of the ring. Obviously, we knew how great of a boxer he was, but I think that was only 20% of what made him as great as he was.  What he stood for, I mean, it's a guy who basically had to give up a belt and relish everything that he had done because of what he believed in and ended up in jail because of his beliefs.  It's a guy who stood up for so many different things throughout the times where it was so difficult for African-Americans to even walk in the streets. For an athlete like myself today, without Muhammad Ali, I wouldn't be sitting up here talking in front of you guys.  I wouldn't be able to walk in restaurants.  I wouldn't be able to go anywhere where blacks weren't allowed back in those days because of guys like Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor, Jackie Robinson, and the list goes on and on. So when an icon like Muhammad Ali passes away, it's just very emotional.  It's also gratifying to know that that guy, one man, would sacrifice so much of his individual life knowing that it would better the next generation of men and women after him. So today I can sit and go to China and make trips to China and all over the world and people know my name and know my face.  I give all credit to Muhammad Ali because he was the first icon.  He is the goat.  He is the greatest of all time, and it has zero to do with his accomplishments inside the ring.  So hopefully I was able to cover it.",
        "2": "I just think it's in you.  If it's in you, then it will be brought to light.  If it's not, then it won't.  I would never compare myself to Muhammad Ali because I never had to go through what those guys had to go through back in those times.  But in my own daily struggles, as I continue to say, growing up in the inner city, being a statistic that was supposed to go the other way and I'm able to sit up here today and knowing that I was a guy who beat the odds, it's just you never take for granted the path and the guys who just every single day just struggled in their individual lives and everything they had to go through on a daily basis for us, for a guy like myself. Yes, I've had some adverse moments in my life and, yes, I've had to deal with a lot of things as a professional, and I've spoken up on a lot of issues that other athletes may not speak upon, but I feel it's my duty to carry on the legacy of the guys who did it before me.",
        "3": "I think what's unfortunate sometimes where some of our greats and some of our role models and some of our leaders is that we don't appreciate them until they're gone, and I think that's unfortunate.  But I think in Muhammad's case, I hope we were able to appreciate him from the time that he was set or stepped foot on Earth.  And along his path from a kid all the way to a teenager all the way to an adult and to a father and so on and so on, his legacy will obviously live on. It's funny, last night we were back at the hotel, and a good friend of mine, a role model friend of mine who actually grew up in the same hometown as Muhammad Ali and kind of around the same age, he put on last night, on the TV where we were, the Thrilla in Manila, the fight between Ali and Frazier.  It was just an unbelievable pound-for-pound slugfest, but just two greats just seizing the opportunity and seizing the moment to be in it and do what they love to do. It sent a lot of emotions through all of us just in that room watching it.  Like I said, I had an opportunity to meet him a few times, and for him to be able to fight the disease that he had for so long, I think three decades he had that disease for, and still be able to recognize and do the things that he wanted to do and live on, he's a powerful man.",
        "4": "Well, I think the recipe for success and a basketball game are two different things.  But I think for tomorrow's game we have to be more sharp than we were in Game 1.  And that's not saying we weren't sharp.  We played some really good basketball, but he made too many mistakes.  As I stated after the game on Thursday night, 17 turnovers for 25 points, doesn't matter if you hold Steph and Klay under 10, doesn't matter if Shaun Livingston gets 20 and Iguodala and all those guys played great or even if they didn't play so great, you cannot give up 25 points off turnovers on the road, especially against such a great team.  It's not a good ingredient for success.  So we have to do a better job of that.",
        "5": "I just wanted to be someone to help him get to a point -- I think his talent has always been there.  We all saw that, since he was drafted to Cleveland and his first few years with the team.  What I wanted to -- once I came back, I wanted to see if I could help him grow as a leader, help him grow as a basketball player, help him grow and understanding how important and how fragile these opportunities are. And he's just shown growth every single day.  He's a young man still.  I think the kid's only 24 years old.  He's still a young man, but he's accepted the challenge of being much more vocal, much more hands on as a leader of the team.  He's the quarterback with the plays, with the playbook on his wrist.  When you see the quarterback kind of -- you know.  I'm kind of the offensive coordinator and T. Lue is the head coach and he's the quarterback and he has to go out and make the right reads. The kid has grown in the two years that I've been here, so far.",
        "6": "He's still a scorer.  That's what he does.  He gets buckets.  That's how he says it.  He can score with the best of them in our league.  And you never want to take that aggression away from him.  As a team, we know as a team, not just Kyrie, we know as a full 15-man roster, when the ball is moving and the ball has energy behind it, we're all in good rhythm.  And that's part of the reason why we're here again.",
        "7": "At the end of the day it's not about myself or Steph or Klay or Kyrie or Draymond and the list goes on and on.  It's about the Warriors and the Cavs.  You win a championship, we all don't get an individual trophy, you know (laughing).  You all get your individual rings.  But at the end of the day, it's about a team.  This is one of the greatest ultimate sport team games.  So it's not about that. I think as an individual, when you're going against the best, your competitive side automatically kicks in.  So no matter who is across from you, you want to be able to hold your end of the bargain against the guy across from you.  So that's just competitive nature.  I think everyone knows that.  But we don't come into a game saying, okay, it's Kyrie versus Steph.  It's Swish versus Klay.  This is our game plan, they have their game plan, and it's who executes it the best.",
        "8": "I think it's been very good.  At the end of the day, we have the same goal, and that is to bring a championship to Cleveland.  And that's all that matters.  I think he's the owner of the team.  I'm just one of the players and one of the 15 guys.  So I'm one of the lower guys on the totem pole, so I just do my job.  I'm just here to work.",

      "questions": {
        "0": "Ty mentioned a minute ago that he spoke with you this morning about playing faster.  What did you see and do you feel like that is something that you need to do going into Game 2?",
        "1": "He also mentioned that the way they're defending and switching that this is the kind of series for isolation ball, and it's something that we've talked about that you ask Kyrie can do very well.  Do you feel like if you just play a little better that this is the kind of series where you can thrive in isolation?",
        "2": "There is a stat out there that you're 9-0 after losing Game 1 in the postseason.  That's a pretty staggering number.  I'm curious if you have any thoughts as to why that is?",
        "3": "You're 9-0 in Game 2 after losing Game 1 in the postseason.  That's a pretty high number.",
        "4": "If I could follow up, when Ty said that he showed you guys clips of all the lay-ups, that you guys blew eight or nine lay-ups at the rim that weren't even contested.  So after you watch the film, do you leave that game encouraged that it really wasn't as far off as maybe the score indicated, or are you still discouraged that on a night Steph and Klay don't play well that you still lose by 15?",
        "5": "The Cavs just scored seven three-pointers last night compared to the Eastern games.  It's not good.  Do you know what is the reason?  Is it because of the Warriors defense or a bad night?",
        "6": "The Cavs scored seven three-pointers last night compared to when you played the Eastern games.  It's not good.  Do you know what is the reason, was it the Warriors defense or did you have a bad night?",
        "7": "You have experienced both pursuing championships and defending championships.  I wonder from your perspective, once you win one, is there a pressure removed that allows a team to play more freely the following season?  And when you're in pursuit of one, is that pressure something that's very difficult to get out from under?",
        "8": "LeBron, is there anything you guys can do as a team to get J.R. going offensively?",
        "9": "LeBron, what did you think about the way you guys defended them, and are there a lot of changes you have to make on that end of the floor, or is it mainly offense?",
        "10": "Is that kind of like human nature when Steph and Klay are out to relax because you know those guys shoot so well and they're not out there anywhere?",
        "11": "Last night you guarded Steph on several possessions.  Is that Coach's plan or just you wanted to take the challenge?",
        "12": "To touch on their bench again, a couple of players told me that they were a little winded having to chase Steph and Klay around.  Is there a team other than the Warriors out there that comes to -- that can prepare a team to chase those guys and then have to exert just as much energy for those guys coming off the bench?",
        "13": "As a leader, what is the message for your team after this loss going into Game 2?",
        "14": "We keep talking about the bench and the numbers staggering, 45-10.  Your guys' depth has been such a strength throughout the course of the regular season, the postseason.  At some point can you just say we've got to stick with these guys on your team and maybe know that you have the faith in what they've already accomplished?",
        "15": "Yesterday in the game at the end of the third, beginning of the fourth, when you sat out they took the lead, went up by 14, that's also during the time of the Delly common foul discussion.  Do you get a breather there?  Was that just part of normal rotation minutes, or did you need a rest?",
        "16": "Do you feel that maybe you could have gotten in earlier, maybe talked with the coach?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, I mean, Coach has given us a game plan, and we need to execute it.  If Coach feels like we need to play faster, then we do.  We've got to push the tempo a little bit more offensively, see if we can get down, get some easy baskets and get to the flow of our game. It's been a good thing for us throughout the whole season once Coach Lue took over, so we need to do that.",
        "1": "Well, it's a fine line.  You know, when you're out there and they're switching and you have a one-on-one matchup, I think quick moves and not holding it as long is good.  I think when you keep the ball on one side for too long and you're pounding and pounding and pounding, then that can -- too much of that won't result in good basketball.  It won't result in good rhythm for everyone out on the floor. So there is a fine line.  I'm okay with us having some isolation basketball if we're going quick.  But we're holding the ball and we're just staring down the defense and we're staring down the ball, then it can become a problem for us.",
        "2": "Say that again?",
        "3": "I don't know.  My team has always been able to recalibrate, look at the mistakes that we had in Game 1, I guess, and come up with a better game plan in Game 2 and be able to execute it.  So I've been a part of some resilient teams that's bounced back from a Game 1 loss either at home or on the road.",
        "4": "No, I'm not discouraged at all.  I understand we had our opportunities.  We played some good basketball for 36 minutes, and the fourth quarter got away from us.  We definitely missed some really easy looks.  Some looks that we're accustomed to making that we've made all year long.  But not discouraged in the fact that we were able to get into the paint, get where we want to go, but we've got to be able to knock them home. As far as Steph and Klay, at the end of day those guys and this team is here not just because of those two, and we have to respect the rest of those guys like we respect Steph and Klay, those guys that are either on the floor or the guys that enter the ballgame.",
        "5": "I don't understand your question, to be honest.",
        "6": "We just want to play our game.  Play our game offensively and defensively and live with the results.",
        "7": "Well, I think it's a little bit of both, but another year of experience definitely allows your team to play free, to know and expect out of the guy beside you.  You just know when you go through -- when you're able to finally accomplish winning a championship, you know how hard it is to win that.  You know exactly what to expect out of the guy next to you from that point on because you've been through so much.  There's no easy route to winning a championship.  So that allows the game to be easier.",
        "8": "He's a huge part of our success, and we've got to do a better job of trying to get him some looks early on and just to keep him engaged throughout the whole game.  Three shot attempts is not enough for him.  He had a big fall to start the game that really bothered him. But we've still got to keep him involved where he doesn't feel like he's just chasing around Steph and chasing around Klay all game, things of that nature.  He's a big piece of our team, for sure, so we've got to find ways to get him looks.",
        "9": "Well, I think we defended them well, not great.  I think we cannot relax when those guys make their subs.  Livingston, Barbosa, Iguodala, those guys come into the game and they change tempo and they play with just as much confidence as Steph and Klay and Draymond.  And we have to understand that we have to treat those guys, like I said, like All-Stars, just like Steph and Klay and Draymond are.",
        "10": "It's not that we relax.  It's just that when you have two of the greatest shooters in the game, they come out and you know your defense doesn't have to be so extended.  We all know that Livingston doesn't shoot threes.  Iguodala shoots some.  But they're not like Steph and Klay where your defense has to be extended to half court. When those guys come in, you're able to shrink your defense a little bit more, so you tend to -- I don't want to say relax, but your defense is picked up a little bit lower so those guys get to where they want to get to.  They get to their sweet spots.  We may have to change that approach a little bit.",
        "11": "Both, both.",
        "12": "Well, no other team in our league has the two best shooters in the league on the same team.  And no other team in our league has that many playmakers.  I mean, people look at Steph and Klay, but when you add Draymond and Livingston and Iguodala, it adds playmakers.  You know, so you can't just key in on one guy.  Those guys can all make a play for not only themselves, but for others. Us having six days off definitely, I guess, wore on some of our guys' legs from a fatigue standpoint.  But it is what it is.  We're in The Finals at this point.  So I think it was good though to get that first game out of the way.",
        "13": "Well, we've got to be better.  We've got to be much better going into Game 2.  I don't think we're that far off.  You just know that you cannot -- when you're playing against a team this great, you cannot make mistakes or you have to limit your mistakes.  Even with how well they played off the bench, outscoring us 45-10, you also can't combat that by having 17 turnovers for 45 points in their building.  It's just not a success for winning.",
        "14": "Oh, absolutely.  I mean, from one game you don't just throw -- like I said before, even after, I think it was after Game 4 in the Toronto series you guys asked me about taking the series over or whatever the case may be because Kyrie and Kev had struggled a little bit.  But we got to this point because our bench has been so productive.  We got to the point in the Toronto series because Kyrie and Kev carried us along that way. So you don't just throw everything away over one game.  Our bench has been so productive for us.  They know they're going to have to have a great series in order for us to win it.  So we have a lot of pride in there from our bench, and I know they're going to take that even better going into Game 2.",
        "15": "It was part of the normal rotation.  I usually come out at the end of the third anyways.  I was able to get a little more extra rest because of the referees going to review what had happened.  But, yeah.",

        "0": "You guys came out really strong in the third quarter, got a lead.  It seemed like you had the momentum and then there was that small altercation with Delly and Iguodala.  Did that break you guys, the momentum, and did you feel like you guys kind of maybe lost your composure after that happened?",
        "1": "Obviously holding Steph and Klay to a combined 20 would seem to be a great blueprint.  Is it discouraging to then see their bench erupt for 45?",
        "2": "LeBron, taking a step way back from it all, this is your seventh Finals, and I think you've only won Game 1 once.  So you've been in this situation a bunch.  What do you make of just what happened tonight and where you are now and just how you get into this series?",
        "3": "LeBron, obviously this team and this series is a lot different than last year.  But how much different after this game here do you think it is?",
        "4": "The Warriors roster is the same, but last year it was Curry, it was Klay and some of those guys taking over.  But after Game 1, having the bench go and score 45 points, does that change your view of how this series might go and what you have to prepare for?",
        "5": "What's happened with our bench?  Your bench combined scored 10 points and J.R. scored three points?",
        "6": "Joe touched on it earlier, you've been in this position before already.  Curious to some of your guys, the other guys.  This is a loss in Game 1.  This is The Finals.  A stage like that, this is a time where some younger players can possibly get overwhelmed.  What have you seen from the other guys?",
        "7": "You guys had 17 assists in this game tonight.  Were you happy with the flow of the offense?  It seemed like you and Kyrie a lot of times were taking it upon yourself to try to score?",
        "8": "We saw Iguodala strip Westbrook and Durant in the close of Game 6.  Tonight he got one on you, one on Kyrie.  Anything you can do knowing about his wingspan, his quickness, and his anticipation to prevent that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, we're not a team that loses our composure over anything.  We played well in the third quarter to get ourselves back into the game, even taking the lead a couple times.  It was a six-point game to start the fourth, and we just didn't start the quarter like we should have, and they did a great job of pushing the lead up to double digits really fast.",
        "1": "When you get outscored 45-10 on the bench and give up 25 points off 17 turnovers, no matter what someone does or doesn't do, it's going to be hard to win, especially on the road.  And that's what it was.  Obviously the game ball goes to Shaun Livingston.  Came in, gave them a huge spark. But don't matter what you do with Steph and Klay, don't matter what you do with Draymond.  Give up 45 points off the bench and 25 points off turnovers on the road, it's not a good ingredient to win.",
        "2": "Well, we've got to be much better in Game 2, obviously.  I think defensively we had a game plan and we followed it as much as possible.  Well, as great as we could for 48 minutes.  We had some breakdowns, which we know we can get better with.  Offensively, we've got to be much better.  We've got to be much better moving the ball, moving bodies.  They're a great team when you just hold the ball and pound the ball.  So we've got to do a better job with that, which Coach Lue and the coaching staff will make sure we do in Game 2. So we look forward to the challenge again.  Just two days in between doesn't help.  It doesn't feel good.  But it gives our body a chance to get some rest.",
        "3": "I don't quite get your question.",
        "4": "I think you're wrong in the fact of saying it was just Klay and Steph.  I mean, they got to the point where they were last year and won a championship because of their whole team and their bench.  And they're here once again in The Finals because of their whole team.  So nothing has really changed. They're a team that's had another year under their belt, and they've exceeded what they did last year.  So it's kind of hard to answer that question because it's not really true.",
        "5": "What happened?  They scored 45 points, we scored 10.  That's what happened.",
        "6": "Well, I think they look forward to seeing what we can do better tomorrow in our film session and seeing ways we can get better going into Game 2.  Yeah, we've got some young guys, but as far as confidence in those guys not believing, that's never been the case for us or any of the guys in the locker room. I know they're excited.  We had a chance in that third quarter to do something special, but we didn't counter and do it.  Didn't make it happen in the fourth quarter. So I'm looking forward to seeing the film session and seeing ways we can get better going into Game 2, and I think our team will as well.",
        "7": "At times I was and at times I wasn't.  We've definitely got to do a better job getting the ball moving side-to-side, getting their bodies moving.  They're a great team.  When you have the ball on one side, they're able to load and do things of that nature. So, you know, we will have a better game plan going into Game 2 for sure offensively.  Sometimes your offense dictates your defense, and the fact that we had 17 turnovers and that led to 25 points is not a good ingredient for our offense for sure.",

        "0": "LeBron, Stephen was just asked about whether or not he cares about being the face of the league and supplanting LeBron James or not supplanting.  Where are you on that?  Do you care?  And is it something that means something to you to be thought of as the face of the league?",
        "1": "I know you're versed in the history of the league and the rivalries that came before you.  What's it like for you to forge these new experiences?  You've had multiple Finals against Tim Duncan, for example, going against Steph Curry this time again.  What's it like to be in the middle of this?",
        "2": "On Friday you spoke a lot about this newfound appreciation you have this postseason for what you've been able to accomplish.  For most people getting to that new mindset is the result of specific events or conversations or just thoughts.  I'm just wondering what prompted you specifically this off-season to get to this new mindset.",

        "4": "A quick funny one, have you ever taken an Uber?",
        "5": "The real one here is a couple weeks ago you were talking about the MVP, and a bunch of us in this room and across the country took it as though you were slighting Steph, and Steph replied and it made for all sorts of headlines.  But beyond that, is there some sort of tension now or rivalry there between you two just because last year you were in The Finals and you're here again?",
        "6": "LeBron, we often see in boxing a boxer looking forward to a rematch against the boxer who he lost to.  Did it matter who you were facing in The Finals?  Did you want the rematch against the Warriors, or were you just as happy and satisfied if you were taking on the Thunder?",
        "7": "Talking like Jay said, you appreciate history.  Andy Varejao is the first player to be traded from one team in the middle of the season and then play for the opposing team in the NBA Finals.  With that context to it and you in the past have called him one of your favorite teammates you've suited up with, what do you think about the fact that you'll be going up against him with the title on the line?",
        "8": "When you return to Cleveland there is the idea of obviously trying to bring a championship to Cleveland to the Cavaliers.  How have you been able to minimize what a lot of people think is an immense amount of pressure?",
        "9": "Following up on the question about Andy, how would you characterize, given his corporate knowledge of the Cleveland Cavaliers, your level of concern about his knowledge playing a role in this series?",
        "10": "Secondly, no matter how the series turns out, should he earn a ring either way?",
        "11": "At the end of the regular season you were talking about you have to shift into the Playoffs mode.  Do you have a Finals mode, and what is that?",
        "12": "LeBron, can you rate or rank the teams you've played on going into The Finals as far as health and playing the right way at the right time?  How do you feel going into The Finals with some of the other teams?",
        "13": "You mentioned that when Andy left, the team now is completely different.  Could you give a brief explanation how different is the team offensively and defensively since he left?",
        "14": "Some media released predictions which said Cavs have just a low percent chance to win the Championship.  What is your reaction to this?  Do you think the Cavs are the underdog?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "First of all, I think what I care about is being fortunate to be a part of this league.  I have no sense of entitlement to be in this league.  This is a fraternity, and for me to even be a part of the 40-plus guys that we have in our league, I think it's an honor, and that's what I focus on.  I also focus on being a role model to the youth that looks up to me and what I'm able to do not only on the court but off the court. So me having the power for our youth to see better light or whatever the case may be, that's what I love more than anything.  So if that comes with my name or whatever I do on a day-to-day basis that the youth get to see how it should be done or how to take advantage of any situation they're in, I'm okay with that.",
        "1": "I think it's great.  It's great for our game.  It's great for you as an individual, just the competitive side of it, to be able to face greats along your path is something that you're going to wish you could get back when you're done playing. Like you said, I've been fortunate to go against Duncan, and K.G. and Ray Allen and the great Piston team.  Now Steph, the great Steph and the Warriors team.  So I've been fortunate.  I don't want to leave out Dirk, as well.  I faced Dirk in The Finals and faced K.D. and Russ.  So I've been very fortunate to go against some of the greatest players in their era, in my era, and we'll see after the era when I'm done.",
        "2": "It's not a new mindset.  I think people are taking it a little further than where it should be.  Something just -- it was a feeling I was after we won in Game 6 in Toronto, and that's how I was feeling at that moment.  I'm back to my usual self.",
        "3": "I'm no longer appreciating what I've been able to do (laughing).",
        "4": "I have, but I don't have an account.",
        "5": "First of all, I made the mistake by even answering the question because I knew where it was going to go, and I guarantee how it was phrased to Steph wasn't how I answered the question.  So obviously his reaction was what it was.  And I've been there before as well.  So Steph was definitely the MVP of our league and is the MVP in our league and is a great basketball player, and what he does for this league is amazing. Then the question was asked if I had a vote what would the difference be between most valuable and MVP, and I gave my opinion.  So obviously you guys ran with it. But I don't know.  You guys make rivals.  I mean, I think it's great for the sport.  It's great for all sports.  I don't think me and Steph -- when you talk about rivalries, you talk about Carolina-Duke, you talk about Ohio State-Michigan.  It's hard to say LeBron and Steph.  If there's a smaller scale or another word for a rival. The fact that we're going back-to-back I think is pretty unique.  It's pretty unique to be in this position and just to have another opportunity, another opportunity for guys to write about it, for us to play it, for the people to talk about it throughout the world.  I'm blessed that I can be a part of conversations.",
        "6": "It didn't matter for us.  It's too hard for us to kind of -- throughout our postseason run we can't -- we weren't looking over on the West side seeing what was going on as far as who we'd like to play, because that would have been slighting our competition and who we were going against from Detroit to Atlanta to Toronto. It was just we were focusing on our job and if we were fortunate enough to win four games in the first series, four games in the second series, and four in the Conference Finals, then whoever our next opponent was going to be we were going to be well prepared for.  So it didn't matter for sure.",
        "7": "I think good things happen to good people.  So either way he would have been part of The Finals.  He's done so much in his career.  He's sacrificed a lot.  For him to be in this position I think is great for him, for his family.  No matter what has happened, he would have been here anyways.",
        "8": "I don't really get involved into the whole pressure thing.  I think I've exceeded expectations in my life as a professional.  I'm a statistic that was supposed to go the other way, growing up in the inner city, having a single-parent household.  It was just me and my mother.  So everything I've done has been a success.  So as far as the game of basketball, I just go out and play it and have fun and love it, and be true to the game and to my teammates and live with the results.  So I don't -- doesn't really get to me too much.",
        "9": "Well, we're a totally different team than when he left.",
        "10": "I mean, that's not for me to debate.  For me, I'm just trying to put our team in the best position to win Game 1 and to move on to the next game.  But I haven't even -- I can't even go that far down the line right now.",
        "11": "No, I think it's all part of it.  It's not another mode that I get into.  It's all part of the mindset and the commitment to what needs to be done to get the job done.  Sometimes you're very successful, sometimes you come close.  But I prepare myself mentally and physically for whatever that needs to be done, and I live with the results.",
        "12": "It would be hard for me to rank it right now.  I've been fortunate to be a part of seven Finals appearances, and every team that I've been on gave everything that we had.  Some we fell short and some we've been able to get over the mountaintop.  But not one team -- or one team didn't work harder than the next team.  It's too hard to get to this point.  It's too hard to get to this point to pick one team over the next, how much commitment that you've got to give to every day for you to even be a part of The Finals. And people look at my situation and kind of take it for granted seeing I've been here six straight times and they think it's easy, when it's not. Every team that I've been on has given everything they had just to get to that point.  So I'm fortunate to be here again.",
        "13": "Just a different team.",
        "14": "I don't get involved in that.  I really don't.  I don't get involved in predictions or the chances of this, chances of that.  Just got to go out and play the game between the four lines and 94 feet.  That's the only thing I focus on. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, as you know, you've fought against this idea all year that the Cavs were preordained to be in The Finals, that you were supposed to be here.  How do you feel right now within that context? Le",
        "1": "LeBron, you seem to be a little bit in awe right after the game with the fans.  Can you just talk about your feelings with both the fans here and what you saw in this building? Le",
        "2": "LeBron, this is the second straight year you guys made The Finals.  Last year obviously last year Kyrie and Kevin, their bodies weren't intact the way they are right now.  What's changed between this year and last year? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, in a game like this, there are times when you can and will do whatever it takes to win a game for your team.  In this particular case, you had so much help from the guys on your left and your right.  Can you talk about what each of them were able to do and the way you felt watching them do it? Le",
        "5": "From the outside, it looks like there's something special brewing.  It seems like a camaraderie from the first man down to the last man on the roster.  Is that the sense you guys get, as well?  Can you talk about what you guys are feeling and what's going on with this team? Le",
        "6": "I may be taking too much of this but last year after you guys clinched to go to The Finals I remember some champagne bottles in the locker room and nothing outrageous but a champagne celebration.  Tonight there was just water on the floor doesn't look like there was any champagne.  I was wondering if there was any significance behind that? Le",
        "7": "LeBron, on the court afterward in the interview with Doris, it seemed like you got a little bit choked up.  Can you give us a sense what the emotion was, and when you hear six straight for you, what does that -- how do you process that? Le",
        "9": "LeBron, city of Cleveland hasn't won a championship in over 50 years.  Being from Akron, how does it feel to kind of have a shot to beat the drought? Le",
        "10": "LeBron, during the regular season you said your team is okay, it's not great.  Where are you guys right now, and which part did you guys improve the most? Le",
        "11": "Can you tell me what you guys thought of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan coming over before the end of the game to congratulate you guys as they walked off the court?  What did you think of that move, and do you know what you guys said to them? Le"

        "0": "I never got involved in that because we're not entitled to anything.  We earned the right to be here and represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals.  We work our tails off every single day.  We commit to one another and we sacrifice to one another.  We're not supposed to be here; we earned our right.  We earned our right to be here today.",
        "1": "It's an unbelievable atmosphere.  These fans, they mean a lot to their team, and I think the team gave everything they could throughout this whole season.  To go to a place they've never been before, to get to the Eastern Conference Finals, and to win two games on their home floor as well, in front of their fans throughout this Conference Finals, it just showed their appreciation.  They were unbelievable all season long to this point, and they definitely showed that toward the end of the game, all the way throughout.",
        "2": "There's definitely a different feeling.  I didn't appreciate last year myself personally on getting to The Finals.  Just so much was going on in my mind, knowing that Kev was out for the rest of the season and knowing that Ky was dealing with injuries all the way from the first round. I just didn't appreciate it.  It's definitely a different feeling.  Having these guys right here at full strength, having our team at full strength, and the way I feel personally, I appreciate this moment, to be able to be a part of it and to be there once again.",
        "3": "We wouldn't be at this point today going to The Finals without those two.  Throughout the first three rounds, they've been the reason why we've played at such a high level.  They've accepted the challenge.  They wanted to get back to this moment.  Ky being out seven months, this guy [Love] doing rehab for three-and-a-half months on his shoulder, they just had so much built up -- anxiety or rage or excitement or whatever the case may be throughout the whole process, just to be back on the floor and to show why we were all put together.  For us to be at this moment, I know they have a lot to say about it, so please don't ask me the next question.  Ask one of those guys.",
        "5": "It doesn't matter what's going on on the outside.  It's not our problem.  It's not what we're about.  We've got 15 guys, we've got a coaching staff, we've got a fan base, we've got an organization and management and everybody on a day-to-day basis that we represent, and that's all that matters.  We all preach the same words.  We all go about our business the same way every single day.  So what goes on in the outside world doesn't really matter to us.  It just feels great to go out there and sacrifice and play for guys that truly just have the same goal in mind, truly care for one another both on and off the floor, and that's the results of it.",
        "6": "We didn't have champagne, so we took waters. [Laughter] That's it. KEVIN LOVE: I had chocolate milk.",
        "7": "I did.  Like I said, I didn't appreciate last year, what we were able to accomplish in our first year.  I'm just truly blessed.  I mean, the man above has given me an unbelievable ability, and I just try to take full advantage of it and to -- I get to do what I love to do every single night, and that's to play the game of basketball.  That's my life.  It's everything, and I give everything to the game.  To be in a position where I can go out and help a group of guys get to places where either they haven't been before or been but want to accomplish even more in their careers, it just means a lot.  So a lot of emotions were just going through my head at that point in time, talking to Doris, and just appreciating what I've personally been able to do throughout my career so far. It means a lot.  The game of basketball has given me everything, and I would never cheat the game, no matter how many games I win, no matter how many games I lose, that really doesn't matter to me because I really just give it all.  That's why I can sleep well at night.",
        "9": "I don't really get caught up in all of that.  We're going to prepare ourselves.  Our coaching staff will prepare us, and we're going to go out and give it our all, and we're going to live with the results. I know our city deserves it.  Our fans deserve it.  But that gives us no sense of entitlement.  We've still got to go out and do it.  We've still got to go out and prove ourselves and be as great as we can be every single night we hit the floor.  We look forward to the challenge.",
        "10": "We're still okay.  We're not great yet.  We've got one more round to become great, so we look forward to it.",
        "11": "Yeah, we know what we said to them, but I don't think it's for everyone.  But what those two guys have done for this franchise and this city and this fan base, nothing short of amazing.  Being two All-Stars, carrying those guys through a first-round seven-game series, a second-round seven-game series and then a Conference Finals Game 6 in their home building, they were spectacular.  They were great.  These fans here, I know they know what they have, and they sure appreciate talent like DeMar and Kyle.  So it was fun competing against them. They're classy guys.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, obviously the point total and the differential is going to be a big story line, but how refreshing is it to have a lot of those first-quarter points come off of defense? Le",
        "1": "LeBron, you spoke this morning about just a sense of calm.  How much of that was just how many times you've been here before, and was there any part of it that you knew what was going to happen tonight, you knew that was still in there? Le",
        "3": "First of all, when Kevin Love throws you an outlet pass in full stride, not everybody can do that on either end.  Explain the dynamics of what makes that such a great basketball play. Le",
        "4": "Also we talked about how Kevin is feeling more connected to the team and maybe coming out of his shell a little bit more.  What is it that you saw tonight that makes you think that that's true? Le",
        "5": "LeBron, when you did have playoff struggles early in your career and everybody, the whole world was watching, you were able to bounce back from that and get yourself to a point to have accomplishments.  You kind of saw that play out for Kevin.  When we spoke after Game 3, you said, we're going to help him, but also he kind of has to do it for himself.  What's that process like seeing him, I guess, achieve that first challenge? Le",
        "6": "LeBron, I guess you haven't heard the outside noise, people saying, why is LeBron not taking over the game, why is he not doing more?  You haven't had to do that, and I'm curious to ask in this game in particular, you see a blowout fashion, I think people would assume that you just took over from start to finish.  How is this team still able to be so effective and you stay within the team system and stick to the script? Le",
        "7": "LeBron, with the limited minutes you've been able to play the last two games and the type of basketball you potentially have ahead of you here, what does it do for your body to be able to only play under 32 minutes in a Game 5? Le",
        "8": "You said earlier today on Uninterrupted that you like the pressure of Game 5 because it's going to show you what this team is all about.  What do you think the team showed tonight? Le",
        "9": "LeBron, you guys were so dominant in rebounding tonight, but when you're playing against a team that has so many big guys like the Thunder, how can you be sure you maintain the same great performance in rebounding? Le",
        "11": "For both of you, how do you take this aggression that you had from the start tonight into Toronto on Friday? Le",
        "12": "We've talked a little bit about this before, and then today you've been mentioning about being calm and why.  I'm curious what your streak of consecutive series with at least one road win means to you, and put it within the context of you've got one more chance to extend that to 25 on Friday. Le"

      "answers": {
        "0": "We understood that coming back from Game 3 and Game 4 we just didn't play our defense the right way.  We didn't play how we should have played, and they took advantage of every moment.  We had to get back to our staple.  We had to get back to what we wanted to do defensively in order for us to play a complete game.  That was the most satisfying thing, the way we defended, holding these guys to 39 percent shooting.",
        "1": "I've been a part of some really adverse situations, and I just didn't believe that this was one of them.  So it's just been very calm about the whole situation, understanding that our guys knew what we did and what we didn't accomplish in Toronto.  I'm not taking away from the fact how big of a game this was, because it is -- it's a Game 5 on our home floor and the series tied 2-2.  But from the very moment that we lost Game 4, I was just very calm about the whole situation, seeing the good that we can prepare and get better for Game 5 instead of looking at all the bad that we did.  Just mentally just having these guys focus, and they answered the call.",
        "3": "Well, first of all, like you stated in the first part, having someone like Kevin who can make that pass.  He's been throwing outlet passes, chest passes full court, for a long time now, probably all the way back to high school.  Obviously we saw it at UCLA, we saw it at Minnesota, and now we're starting to get that connection here, and we have it.  For me, it's fun for me that I can be a receiver again, taking me back to my football days, and just try to keep the cornerback on my hip and not look up until the ball gets there, and then I'm able to finish.  It was a huge play, and in that particular case, we kind of even talked about it while the jump ball was going on with Swish [J.R. Smith] and he was able to lead me to the rim and I was able to finish.",
        "4": "Well, I don't believe that's true to the first part.  Kevin has always been out of his shell; he just doesn't do it around you guys because it's not about that.  What we do as a team, we keep everything in house, and besides RJ [Richard Jefferson] bringing out Little Kev recently, everything has been in house.  But Kevin is a great guy, a great teammate, and tonight was just a bounce-back for him.  He knew he didn't play his style of basketball or how he wanted to play to help us win in Toronto.  He wanted to make a different outcome of it, and he did that tonight.  He's a true professional.",
        "5": "I mean, it's very difficult and you feel like you're by yourself.  I've been there before, when you're a big part of a puzzle, and things just don't go the way you either dreamed about it or the way you thought it was going to be.  You feel like you're by yourself for 24 hours or 48 hours or however long the case may be.  To see him come out the way he did tonight, just aggressive from the beginning, his first bucket, his first paint touch -- his first touch was in the paint, a right-hand jump hook.  We knew from that point on that that's where he wanted it, and we continued to go to him.  So it was great to see him bounce back like that.",
        "6": "Because we didn't get to this point in our season by me taking over every game.  I kind of laugh at it when I hear from you guys, when I do my media availability, people saying take over the game.  My presence on the floor is much bigger than what numbers talk about.  When you have a young superstar like this guy [Irving], you have Kevin, who's a superstar as well, and they've helped us get to this point, so you don't just throw in the kitchen sink because we lose two games or we didn't play as well as we could.  There may be a time when I may have to have one of those big games, but until then, just relax.",
        "7": "It's great for sure.  Any time you're able to clock in under, for me, 35 minutes, it's great.  But my body has been trained all season to do whatever it takes.  Tonight was one of those instances where I didn't need it as much, but I've trained my body over quite a few months now to -- whatever Coach needs me, whenever this team needs me, I'll be ready for it.",
        "8": "That they were ready for it as well.  They were ready for this moment.  Our crowd was ready for this moment.  They were amazing, as always.  Give a lot of thanks to those guys.  They were amazing from the beginning.  It starts with our floor general.  Our floor general came out, and I think he had 12 in the first quarter.  He got to where he wanted to get on the floor, his pull-up was working, his three in transition was working; e led the team, put us in position to succeed.  And obviously Kev had a huge first quarter as well.  Everybody else just followed their lead after that.",
        "9": "Well, for us, rebounding is always a big part of our staple, especially for Double-T [Tristan Thompson] and for Kevin, for myself, and Ky is starting to get down there a little bit as well.  We want to get stops.  We want to defend, and when you're able to make a team miss, you want to clean the glass, and we were able to do that tonight.  We held them under their shooting averages obviously from the previous two games, so we were able to clean the glass and that allowed us to get out on our break.",
        "11": "It's a huge key to our success.  If we understand that, we put ourselves in the best possible chance of winning.  We showed it in Toronto Game 3 and Game 4 when we got down 16 or 18.  We showed we're capable of doing -- all the way down to Game 4 we had a chance to win.  We've got to come out from the beginning, and it starts with the Big Three.  It starts with myself, Kev and Ky, and we've got to do a great job of pushing the tempo, getting these guys ready, and we'll be much better.  We'll be more prepared.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan in 3 and 4, and we didn't execute it.  But we'll be more prepared.",
        "12": "Well, you were the first person to bring it up to me.  I had no idea.  I really don't play my career off accomplishments.  If they happen, so be it.  I've been blessed to be in a position where I can play the game that I love and be around some great guys, and my kids get an opportunity to see me do some special things. My only mindset is to at this point get our guys mentally and physically prepared for a heck of a game on Friday night in Toronto, and if we're able to come home victorious, then the streak continues.  If not, we prepare for Game 7.  But that's my mindset.  My mindset has never been about, I guess, records or streaks or things of that nature. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, we were talking a little bit about it back there, but you score 14 possessions in a row, and it's not enough to put them away.  How frustrating was it from a defensive side that as well as you played offensively it wasn't enough there at the end? Le",
        "1": "You guys shot 14 threes the first quarter.  A lot of them were open looks but they weren't falling.  You seemed to move off of the line after that.  Was that by design? Le",
        "2": "You said this morning you had a game plan for yourself.  From the outside it didn't look drastically different the way you played tonight compared to the other series.  Did you have something different in mind? Le",
        "3": "In the second quarter you mentioned you guys got outscored 30-17.  Was it a matter of effort or execution or what was going on? Le",
        "4": "How difficult is it to overcome when two players on the opposing team both go for 30 plus? Le",
        "5": "When you guys started executing like that in the second half offensively and everything was clicking, it was crisp passing.  How can you transfer that same type of execution on the defensive end? Le",
        "6": "That fourth quarter, with that second unit group that you played with, that's when you guys started getting your mojo back.  As the quarter came to a close, other players started coming back in.  My question is is that lineup that you had right there, is that built to go the distance, or is it just a stopgap? Le",
        "7": "Can you talk about your passing ability?  You do such a good job getting your teammates involved, and when you get the trap and double-team, you find the open man for good shots. Le",
        "8": "There was a sense that you guys might not lose another game all season when you came here this weekend, and I saw the confidence in you this morning when you said, we've got this.  What has happened this weekend, and when you look in the eyes of all the guys in your room, what do you see about the future? Le",
        "9": "You talked about that deficit.  With as good a team as you are and as good of a player as you are, do you feel like when you took the lead by three, you had them at that point? Le",
        "10": "You started off on DeMar, and you guys were switching for the most part and it seemed like they were able to use a screen to get you off of him, get the shot that he wanted.  Is switching effective with these two guys when they know that's what you guys are doing? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It wasn't enough because we got off to a horrible first half once again in this building, and you're playing catch-up the whole game.  So every defensive possession feels even more intensified when you've given up so many points in the first half.  I think they've averaged 58 or something like that in the first half here, and in the high 30s the second half.  It gets a little bit more intensified, but it just goes back to the first half.  We're not starting off games the right way.  The second quarter has been really bad for us here, so we've got do a better job of that where we can't dig ourselves such a big hole and now every possession feels even more intensified late in the game.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, of course.  We've got to be more well-balanced.  We started the game, we had some great looks, but when they're not going, you've got to be able to try to switch it up and get into the paint and see what you can do.  I was able to get into the paint a little bit, Kyrie [Irving] as well.  But we just haven't shot the ball from the three-point line.  That's part of what they're doing as well, but it's part of us being a little bit more conscious about, okay, if it's not going down, then we've got to get into the paint a little bit more and then kick out for threes as well.",
        "2": "I think I played to the game plan that I wanted to play, both offensively and defensively.  For me, I gave everything that I had in the 46 minutes that I played, both offensively and defensively.  I felt great.  Tried to get my guys involved, get myself involved.  My individual game plan was pretty good.",
        "3": "I don't know.  I've got to watch the film to see the mistakes that we made.  But they put it on us good in the second quarter, obviously 30-17.  I think Kyle [Lowry] hit some huge shots in that second quarter.  [DeMar] DeRozan hit some big shots as well.  I've got to go over the film, but obviously 30-17 is not a good ingredient for a win.",
        "4": "Well, first of all you tip your hat to DeMar and Kyle.  They did a great job.  They're All-Stars for a reason.  That's why they're here today.  They've carried this team all season.  But even at the end of the day, as well as they played, we still had a chance.  We still had a chance to win the ballgame.  That's all you can ask for.  But what we can't do is dig ourselves the hole that we did in the first half.",
        "5": "I think defensively when we made that run, we played some really good defense.  I think we had a couple breakdowns that I know in my head that happened throughout the run, but they also made some tough shots.  They made some tough shots.  They made some tough shots while we were making that run.  Cory Joseph made a tough runner over the top of me going right.  I think Kyle made a couple tough ones.  DeMar made a couple pull-ups as well.  We followed our game plan as much as 95 percent of the time.  I can remember two plays that I'm not going to say right now that I wish we had back.  But while we made our run, our defense stepped up, and that was good to see.",
        "6": "I think whatever lineup coach [Tyronn] Lue puts on the floor can go the distance.  We're all professionals.  We have a great group of guys, so no matter who's on the floor, we have to execute.  We have to play to our identity.  I think our second unit did a great job of giving us a boost and whoever comes in after that has to continue to play at a high level. We do a great job as a first unit at times of picking up our second unit, and then at times our second unit does a great job of picking us up.  At the end of the day, whoever is on the floor, we have to play with the same intensity both offensively and defensively.",
        "7": "I've been blessed with a gift to pass the ball and to see the floor, and I just try to take advantage to help my teammates.  I think that's one of my biggest gifts.  I love getting my guys involved and making them feel a part of something special.  Even me being in my 13th year in the NBA, it all started when I was a kid.  My little league coach always said, There's no I in team.  Obviously, we've all heard that, but when you get guys involved, it makes the game a lot easier.  It's always stuck with me to this point today.",
        "8": "I think it's a sense of the outsiders, which I've never really got involved with, saying we may never lose another game.  I don't get involved in it, besides talking to you guys and when I see you guys, is all I know about it.  I don't know anything that's going on outside because I don't watch.  I don't watch sports TV.  I don't read news clippings.  I go home and I watch cartoons with my kids and watch movie channels and Man Vs. Wild and things like that because that's what really is important to me. What the outside people say, I don't really get involved with.  And I am a confident guy.  I'm always confident in my ability and what I can bring to my team, whatever the case may be, whatever the circumstances are.  Going back home, we have to play a lot better, and I think we will.",
        "9": "I definitely thought we had finally got over the curve of how we wanted to play here in this building.  But you've still got to get stops, and they did a great job of just making shot after shot after shot, even when our run was happening.  You give them a lot of credit with that.  They withstand our run and us giving up 54 percent shooting, a lot of it in the first half.  Like I said, when you dig a hole like that, I think we were down by 18 at one point.  Again, when you dig a hole like that, like I said, every possession after that is so intensified.  We got to a point where we were up, but we made a couple more mistakes and they was able to pull away.",
        "10": "I think they did a good job of kind of moving him around.  With me on him, they feel like trying to get me up off of him with a screen, either with a guard so they can force the switch -- that's part of our defense.  But when they screen with a big, we have a goal that we want to try to attack. I think we'll be a lot better on what we want to do and how we want to handle those two guys, because they're playing exceptional basketball.  They're 28 for 43.  I mean, that's top-of-the-tier numbers right there, and they both went for 30.  We've got to be much better in our schemes and doing it a little bit harder as well.

        "0": "Obviously we talked about it last night, the night was not good for Kevin [Love] and Kyrie [Irving].  But it still seemed like you tried to play through them, try to get them going.  Was that the case and why did you stick with that for as long as you did? Le",
        "1": "Ty [Lue] said just now that he needed to do a better job in that situation of putting the ball more in your hands.  Did you sense that at all, like were you on the border whether or not you should try to take that particular game over because your guys just didn't have it? Le",
        "2": "I think half your shots were jump shots last night.  You weren't in the paint as much as you have been.  Did they do a better job at keeping you out of the paint, or did you change things up? Le",
        "3": "Later in the game you were on DeMar [DeRozan] a little bit more, kind of slowing him down.  Was that just because you guys were switching or was that because you felt like you needed to be on him more? Le",
        "4": "Is that something you think will be more of going forward? Le",
        "5": "Is meeting Toronto's physicality one of the biggest challenges going into Game 4? Le",
        "6": "Ty said that he felt like the struggles on offense affected you guys' defensive effort.  Is that a natural thing to happen, or how do you combat that from happening? Le",
        "7": "Richard [Jefferson] was joking a few minutes ago.  He said the mood at dinner was a little disappointed for the first time in probably a month or so.  How much does one loss impact your overall confidence level of where you guys are right now? Le",
        "8": "I know the regular season is one thing, but during the postseason, how do you have a game -- like if you have a close friend on an opposing team during a playoff series, how is that dynamic with you personally, your interactions throughout this? Le",
        "9": "How much has T-Lue been responsible for bringing you guys together as a unit? Le",

        "0": "It's been a huge part of our success.  We're not going to go away from it just because of one game.  It happens; the ball doesn't go in sometimes.  But we can't lose confidence in those guys.  They helped us get to this point.  We understand that in order for us to win every single night, we have to have our guys play well.  It doesn't mean the ball is going to go in all the time, but we can't not go away from them just because it's not going in.",
        "1": "It's always a fine line, for sure.  Obviously the ball, as far as me initiating offense, I don't handle it as much.  With Kyrie kind of setting the offense and then Delly [Matthew Dellavedova] coming in, the ball has kind of been taken out of my hands a little bit.  I'm okay with that.  But there is a point in time where you say, Okay, some of the guys are not going, maybe let me see if I can get it going.  But last night just didn't happen that way.  We'll have a better game plan going into Game 4.",
        "2": "No, I had great looks from the perimeter.  I was able to knock a couple of them down.  My first two shots outside the paint, I was able to knock them down.  I don't want to say it was nothing they didn't do because they definitely played a great game, but I wasn't in the post as much.  I've got to look at the film.  I haven't looked at the film really just yet.  We have our session coming up soon.  It'll be much better in Game 4.",
        "3": "No, I just felt like I needed to be on him.",
        "4": "Every game dictates different challenges.  Yesterday was one of those challenges that I felt like I needed to take control of it.  The guy has been shooting the ball extremely well, especially to open the game up, and he played a heck of a game last night.  I just wanted to get my crack at him.",
        "5": "I don't feel like that's been a problem.",
        "6": "That could be the case.  Obviously we're a team that's played so efficiently offensively that it's helped our defense out a lot as well.  Last night not being as efficient as we usually are, it affected us.",
        "7": "We understand that it's a very good team.  They're the No. 2 team in the conference for a reason.  They were chasing us all year for a reason.  That's why I don't really get involved into what everybody else talks about, because I knew it was a tough team that we were playing.  They won as many games as they won because they were a tough team.  We have to be a much better team tomorrow, and I don't think our confidence is shaken at all.",
        "8": "Well, I've never played Chris Paul, and I've never played D-Wade [Dwyane Wade], but I have played Melo [Carmelo Anthony].  We went at it and didn't have much interaction besides throughout the game, a little bit after a game.  But at the end of the day, I don't think a friendship should ever be sidetracked because you're competing.  You go out and compete no matter if it's your best friend or your brother.  You compete against them, and then when the game is over, you move on.",
        "9": "I just think everyone.  It's the whole growth.  I think naturally when you're around someone day after day after day, you automatically grow.  I think with Coach Lue being here and being at the helm has helped.  I just think everybody that has bought into what we're trying to do has helped as well.",
        "10": "We shot 32 percent from the floor, and he grabbed basically every single one of those rebounds.  He did a great job of getting some tip-offs, too, offensively.  If he's going to get the defensive rebounds, we've got to do a better job of not allowing him to get the offensive rebounds, getting them other opportunities.  Last game we had a couple rebounds that were in our hands and we let them get through and he was able to tap out for three-pointers.  Defensive rebounds, we're okay with that because we need to start getting back on the regs when guys are shooting the shots.  But the offensive rebounds, we've got to control it.",
        "11": "I really don't get involved in it too much.  I just play the game and let the referees decide what the call may be and just move on.  I can't have my focus go somewhere else that allows my energy to be somewhere else where it shouldn't be.",
        "12": "I don't know.  I mean, that's a question for an opponent.  I think our refs do a great job, I think our league does a great job of protecting our players, and that's all that matters.  I would hope it never gets to a point where it gets outside of basketball and competition, but you never know.  I protect myself, my teammates protect me, the refs protect all our players, and the league protects all the players as well. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, after Game 1, you were talking and you said that at some point, adversity would come up and you thought you guys would be ready to handle it.  Losing a game in the playoffs, does that rise to the level of adversity? Le",
        "1": "LeBron, without having seen film, what were some of the reasons that you were not on your game tonight as a team? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, Kyrie [Irving] and Kevin [Love] both struggled tonight shooting, looked like for different reasons.  How do you evaluate how they played and how much more does that put on you when they struggle shooting the ball like they did? Le",
        "4": "The Raptors were saying that tonight Bismack was sort of their energy guy and that's sort of the role he plays on this team.  What did you think of the performance he had tonight? Le",
        "5": "Bismack Biyombo is doing some of the Dikembe Mutombo finger wagging from years ago.  When you see him do that, what kind of reaction do both of you have? Le",
        "6": "LeBron, your normal response to physical play is to kind of dust yourself off and move on to the next play and avoid retaliation.  At what point does that change, could that change? Le",
        "7": "There were a lot of hard fouls out there, but that little skirmish before the end of the first half, it looked like -- did you realize who hit you, and was it as bad as it looked or were you maybe trying to sell a call a little bit? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, first of all, I give a lot of credit to Toronto.  They played an exceptional game tonight.  We didn't play our game, and they made us pay for it.  I mean, it is a little adversity.  Why not?  It's the postseason, and you lose a game.  This is our first loss of the postseason.  I would count it as a little adversity. We've got to go back to the drawing board, not fix everything, just fix a few things, and be much better on Monday.  Obviously we weren't as great as we've been tonight.",
        "1": "I think early on at the start of the game we weren't as physical as we should have been, especially coming into a building that we knew we had to be a little bit more physical.  Understanding they were going to play with a lot of speed, a lot of force, so we didn't start the game as physical as we should have at the point of attack. Also I think we lost track of some of our keys that we came into the game with, allowed us to kind of get sidetracked throughout the course of the game.  Then in the second quarter, our second-quarter lineup didn't do a great job of paying attention to detail, and they was able to bust the game open and score 33 points in that second quarter.  They had 39 for the whole second half.  Allowing them to score 60 in the first half is not the type of game that we want to play.",
        "3": "I think it's good for them.  It's good for them.  First little adversity, first individually in a long time, and I think it's good for them.  I think they'll be much better obviously on Monday, but it's good for them.  When someone is not shooting the ball extremely well, obviously we don't want two of our big guys not to shoot the ball -- it's going to be difficult for us to pull the game out like that.  Even though with our shooting in the 30s, it was still a five-point game at one point in the third quarter.  But we know they'll be much better.  J.R. did a great job of trying to pick the slack up for both Kyrie and for Kev.  Channing [Frye] tried as well and I did as well.  But those guys will be better.  They'll watch the film, and they'll be much better on Monday.",
        "4": "That's what he's been at home and every playoff and every regular-season game.  We understand he feeds off the crowd, but he's also a huge impact on the glass at home.  He gives them a lot of energy, he gives them a lot of second-chance points.  He had eight offensive rebounds.  He cleaned up the glass on all of our misses in the first half.  I think he had at one point 14 rebounds and no points.  The guy just stays in his lane.  He definitely gave them a boost tonight.",
        "5": "Same way you've got right now.  We don't really have a reaction.  He has a great block, we're trying to get back on defense.  We're not watching him wave his finger.  But he probably admires him.  We all take something from somebody.  If I shoot a fadeaway, I got it from MJ.  Throw a no-look pass, I get it from Magic.  He [J.R. Smith] shoots fadeaway threes, I don't know where he gets those from.  We all admire somebody, so it's no big deal.",
        "6": "That's a great question.  You know, obviously teams and a lot of players are kind of taking it a little bit.  At the end of the day, I'm important to this team.  I can't afford to react in any kind of way that will get me thrown out of a game, but I will protect myself.  I will protect myself.  When I was in high school, I got low-bridged playing in an AAU tournament as a junior in high school.  A kid just low-bridged me and I fell and broke my wrist.  That kind of thought always plays in my mind either when I'm getting thrown to the ground or if it's a borderline dirty play.  I always think back to the Jay Z phrase and a line he had: \"If I shoot you, then I'm brainless; if you shoot me, you're famous.  What am I to do?\"  That always plays in my head.  Every time I feel like I want to react, I've got to keep my brain.",
        "7": "I'm not trying to sell a call.  I got hit with an elbow.  I didn't know from my own teammate.  I thought it was DeMarre [Carroll], but I watched the replay, it was from my teammate.  So no -- sell a call for what?  There was no call there to be sold.  That's it.  I was going to say something else to you, but I'm going to leave it alone. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, there's a broader point to this, but have you seen a double team in this series, or have you seen many in the playoffs this year? Le",
        "1": "The biggest point is we've talked so much about how well the two guys with you have been playing in this postseason, but their level of play, does it make it more difficult to deal with you then?  Does it give you more room to do different things when they're playing as well as they are? Le",
        "3": "LeBron, you guys are 10-0 in the playoffs, but the regular season ended April 13th.  Today is May 20th.  That's a lot of time over the course of those games.  Does it feel like a streak because of the nature of the time that's been passed, and if it's not a streak, then what does it take to really sustain that level because of the length in between series? Le",
        "4": "LeBron, last postseason you averaged 42 minutes.  In The Finals it was even more.  I remember there was one game where the guys sitting next to you were both injured.  In terms of how your body feels and your energy levels, is this the best you've felt at this stage of a postseason during this six-year run you've had, and what do you attribute it to? Le",
        "5": "You do seem to be playing at a different gear sometimes than everybody else on the floor.  You look so fresh, and I'm wondering if the things that you did during the break, as you put it, I'm not resting during the break, what effect are you seeing of the work you put in during the break to the kind of energy that you have in these games? Le",
        "6": "You have great respect for a lot of the legends that have come before you.  What did it mean tonight to pass Shaq on the all-time scoring list for the postseason, and also, you ran into Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  I was wondering how that talk with Kareem went. Le",
        "10": "There were some Canadians on social media that were kind of hoping that you guys would get stopped at the border on your way to Canada.  Number one, are your passports up to date, and number two, what are you expecting from the Canadian fans? Le",
        "11": "Passports, are we up to date? Le",
        "12": "LeBron, what has Ty Lue done best and what has he meant to this team? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I've seen everything.  I've seen a lot, and the best thing about it, my teammates have read and react, and either given me space or given me outlets for me to make a pass to them.  Tonight was another example of that.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, it's always difficult to deal with me.  I think it adds even more when you have two All-Stars with you, two guys that command multiple eyes any possession.  They're so in such a great rhythm right now, I've been able to just pick my spots and do other things to help us try to win ballgames while those guys take the load.  Tonight was an example of them giving me a little bit more space, and I just tried to make some plays.",
        "3": "I don't think it feels like a streak.  I think it feels like we won one game.  We won the next game, and how do we prepare and be better the following game.  We've taken one step at a time.  We haven't overlooked any steps along this process thus far, and I think that's part of the reason we're in this position today.  We have to be much better, obviously, in Game 3, going into a very hostile environment, going in there where they're extremely loud.  They play well, they play faster.  But we've enjoyed the process to this point, and once we got to it, we've tried to take care of business, and then once it's over, we want to learn from that instance and move on and see how we can get better the next time.",
        "4": "Well, it's hard to say.  Obviously last year there were no excuses even with these two guys out, and for me personally and the rest of the guys, we gave it everything that we had.  So I didn't feel sorry for myself, didn't feel sorry for any of my teammates.  We didn't feel sorry for nothing because we gave everything that we had. As far as my body, I've been telling guys all year, this is the best I've felt in a while, and I've been able to do things outside of the game that kind of help me, and then when I get to the game, obviously you have two guys like this to help you.  It takes a lot of everything off of you when you have two All-Stars that can do great things.",
        "5": "Well, I think it's a collective workload that we all put on each other throughout the break.  Like I said, Coach Lue gave us one day off, and that was the game after the Sunday game in Atlanta.  I believe we got Monday off, and from that point on, we all worked together just to mentally prepare our bodies, physically prepare our bodies, waiting around to see who we were going to face in the next round, but we just stayed on top of each other, trying to understand, and how can we learn from the Detroit series when we swept to the next round. We've all put in our individual work.  When we're not at our practice facility, and then when we all get together, we just combine it all and just try to make the most of it.",
        "6": "Well, first of all, for me being in a position where -- it just always takes me back to my childhood and watching so many of the greats playing basketball and saying I wish I could be a part of that or at times saying there's no way I could be a part of such a great league, there's no way.  Just the statistics don't look right for me as an African-American kid growing up in the inner city.  I played both sides of the fence as a kid growing up. To be in this position today where I see my name linked to a lot of the greats that have played this game and paved the way for myself and Kyrie and Kev, it means a lot.  It's very humbling.  It's an opportunity for my family to be proud, for my fans to be proud, so that's just a lot of respect with that. I was actually, to your second question, jogging into the locker room like we usually do off the floor, and obviously I saw a legend outside of our locker room, and I slowed my pace up drastically just to embrace a legend being in our building, watching us play.  What he did for the game, the championship runs that he had with the \"Showtime\" Lakers and him being the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and so on and so on and so on, it's just respect.  When you see a guy like that, when you put him in a class with like Jim Brown and Muhammad Ali and Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, those guys all laying that same thing, Bill Russell.  It was a pretty cool moment.",
        "10": "We're good.  We've got Tristan on our team.  (Laughter).",
        "11": "We don't need them.  We've got Tristan.",
        "12": "I think it's just the even-keel mentality that he has.  He's always preaching next play.  Just always next play.  We come to a timeout, no matter what's going on in the game, he just continues to breed confidence and talk confidence to us, the unit that's on the floor, the unit that's off the floor.  Just a sense of calmness.  The game is so fast.  The possessions come so fast.  There are a lot of things going on in between the game, and when you come to a timeout or whatever before the game or at halftime, there's just a sense of calmness.  T-Lue has been great for us as the captain of this ship, and us as the soldiers or whatever you want to tell us or call us on the boat, we're just trying to follow his lead and execute it the right way."

        "2": "The change with you and the second unit to start the second quarter, what impact did that have? Le",

        "5": "You didn't have any nagging injuries, legs feeling heavy? Le",
        "6": "I was watching you watch Kyrie dance on the sideline at the game yesterday. How fun is it to see him enjoying this as much as he is? Le",
        "7": "There were times this year where you were kind of frustrated because guys -- you said they haven't accomplished anything yet, we haven't accomplished, and just various moments of frustration, and you always talk about building habits. Could you tell that the habits were being built the right way? Did you perceive this coming? Le",
        "8": "You talked about read and react. How significant was it for this team to be able to do that? Obviously the Raptors keyed on the perimeter and you guys reacted by taking the paint. Can you talk about that? It's easier said than done; is that fair to say? Le",
        "9": "Where has Tyrone [Lue] grown since taking over this role? Le",
        "10": "How much fun were you having? Le",
        "11": "When you start 9-for-9 like you did last night, are you aware of that? Le",
        "12": "Most of the shots were right in the paint. Is there a zone factor with that or is that more like a jump shot? Le",
        "13": "Talking to Dwyane Wade in the last series, he talked about how in his career sometimes he's trusted teammates and sometimes not, depends on the teammate. Your whole career you've been a guy who's kind of rigorous in trusting guys. With this team, do you have as much trust in this team as you've ever had? Le",
        "14": "Last night was the first time [Kyle] Lowry and [DeMar] DeRozan have never gone to the line in a game as long as they've played together. What can you credit what your defense did to keep them off the line? Le",
        "15": "Do you see something that has to change with their aggressiveness to get to the line? Le",
        "16": "As the lead started to build toward the end of the second and into the third, it seemed like it got a little bit more physical. Do you think that was just the Raptors trying to get in you guys' head, so to speak, or what do you think the reason for that was? Le",
        "17": "It seems like the challenge for the Raptors kind of crystallized last night. They tried to run you off the three-point line and the lanes were open for you and Kyrie. Do you recognize the pressure you're putting on opponents right now to try to figure out how to guard you guys? Le",
        "18": "Is this the best the second unit has played all year? Le",
        "19": "After [inaudible] is it more clear or less clear the difference between a common foul and a flagrant foul? Le",
        "20": "You sure have taken a lot of head shots this postseason. Le"

      "answers": {
        "0": "We're even keel. We're a confident bunch already, but it hasn't got too high or not been what it should be. We understand that we have a game plan every night. We have to go out and execute it. We're a confident bunch, but we're not overexcited by anything.",
        "1": "No, for me that's not a surprise or whatever the case may be. I just play the game. I read and react to the game and see how teams are playing me and then react from there. You know, it wasn't a surprise at all.",
        "2": "I mean, obviously the addition of Channing Frye has helped out a lot. He's given us a dynamic that we didn't have in that second lineup, another big that just spaces the floor, shoots the ball, and also rebounds and defends. So that helps, and me being out there with those guys, it just gives us another threat out on the floor at all times. You know, Kyrie [Irving] and Kevin [Love], they do a great job of closing out the first quarter and I just try and bring my energy back into the second unit and try to help with executing and run things the right way.",
        "3": "No, it was all -- it was all the coaching staff. That's what they wanted.",

        "6": "Well, I think the biggest part of him enjoying it is his approach to the game. He's reaping the benefits of his success right now. He's waited a long time to get back to this position, like I said last night, and the kid is playing some great basketball right now. It's great to see him enjoy his moment.",
        "7": "Well, you continue to talk about it and believe in it and you preach it every day, at some point I feel like it'll turn the corner. For us as a team and for me as a leader, you continue to press and press on and press on and press on with the guys understanding how important this moment is for us, and these guys have accepted the challenge, and I've accepted it with them.",
        "8": "Well, the game isn't easy, for sure, like you're saying. It's very difficult, but we have to be able to make adjustments on the fly if need be. We have a unit that can do that and we have a coaching staff that can put us in position to do that as well. It's great to have that.",
        "9": "T-Lue has been great in every facet of the game. I think it's been a long time coming and he's waited for this moment, and when the moment was presented to him, he was ready for it. It's great to have him, for sure.",
        "10": "Well, when I don't have fun no more in the game of basketball, I won't play anymore.",
        "11": "Well, I know I haven't missed up to that point, but I am not quite sure how many shots I've taken or whatever the case may be, but I know I haven't missed besides missing a free throw. I did miss a free throw. But other than that, I'm not quite sure where I'm at as far as statistics-wise.",
        "12": "Just put pressure on the defense. I live in the paint.",
        "13": "My whole life has been about trusting teammates as I've played the game. That hasn't changed. My motto hasn't changed, obviously. The players I've had over the last few years have gotten better and better. The personnel has gotten better and better.

        "15": "Well, we know we're not going to be able to stop them from getting to the line every game, but we control what we can control. We pay attention to detail, to a T last night, and we need to do that tomorrow as well.",
        "16": "Everyone has pride, and we knew at some point if the game got out of hand -- teams have done that to us. But they can't get inside our heads because at the end of the day, our only main objective is to win a basketball game and nothing else matters. We just continue to protect our players, both teams, and the last four teams standing, everyone needs to be protected out on the floor, and I think the refs did a pretty good job of that last night.",
        "17": "Well, for us we have a game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute it. We don't predetermine what we're going to do offensively. We come into a game saying let's play our game, we want to move the ball, share the ball, get it moving from side to side. We want to attack and we want to get our shooters open, and last night they didn't let our shooters get open too much, so we had the lane. Shump [Iman Shumpert] had some attacks. It was great for him that he was able to get into the lane, Kyrie as well, myself. We know the game is going to be totally different tomorrow. It's a team that they've lost a game in every series so far, and they haven't lost a Game 2. They haven't lost two games in a row. So we understand what their mindset is and how confident they are going into the second game.",
        "18": "We're playing good basketball. It's right now, so I'll say yes because it's right now. We want to win to work on our habits. The best part of our second unit is we defend. We defend, and then offensively it comes easy to us when you defend.",
        "19": "I have no idea what it is. I know what it is when it happens to someone else, but I have no idea when it's involving me. I have no idea what a common foul and a flagrant foul is. I thought Tristan's throwdown last night was a little excessive, but he went up there and made two free throws, and that's all that matters. I pretty much have chalked it up to common fouls with me.",

      "questions": {
        "3": "LeBron, we spent the last couple days talking about the way the Raptors like to shrink the floor and clog and take away the paint.  Tonight they seemed to do the exact opposite.  Is that a sign that you are forcing teams to get out of their comfort zone and do things they're not accustomed to doing? Le",
        "4": "LeBron, you guys knew that they would try something different.  They didn't want to give up that three ball.  But were you surprised a little bit that the single coverage they had -- looked like there was no help once you got past your defender early on. Did that surprise you at all to that extent? Le",
        "5": "You guys came in and we talked all week long about not being rusty.  Dwane Casey mentioned that the Raptors seemed to be a step slower than you guys.  How much did the nine days' rest really help you guys, and how much did you feel that the extra step and that you wouldn't be rusty coming out tonight in Game 1? Le",
        "6": "LeBron, you like to say that there isn't anything that you haven't seen, but what's going on right now, you actually haven't, nine in a row to start a playoff series.  Is there any point where you begin to get concerned about just some waning focus?  When the wins keep piling up, at some point you might be challenged and caught off guard by that? Le",
        "8": "LeBron, there was a moment middle of the second quarter where you chased down a rebound, blew past Carroll on the baseline, you slammed it hard, and then you had a reaction that was pretty memorable.  Can you talk about why you enjoyed that moment so much? Le",
        "9": "Considering what Kyrie went through last year in The Finals, is this exactly the Kyrie you thought you would see in these playoffs? Le",
        "10": "The lineup that you used to start the second quarter, not one that you used a lot during the regular season.  How has that lineup been able to come together so well in such a short time, and can you sense the growing confidence with that group? Le"
      },
      "answers": {
        "3": "I think for us, it's never -- our game plan is never dictated.  I think for us, we want to push the tempo.  We want to move the ball from side to side, and we want to attack.  With myself and Ky, we love to live in the paint.  We love to attack, and then when the defense collapses, we're going to spread out to our shooters.  Tonight they wanted us to be in the paint, and we just tried to take advantage of that.  We had 56 points in the paint, and everyone was still in a great rhythm. I think probably the least amount of threes that we've shot and made probably in the postseason so far, but as I keep telling you guys every single day, we're not a jump-shooting team.  You guys kept looking at me crazy about it.  We're not a jump-shooting team.  We're a balanced team, and whatever the game dictates, we're able to adjust to that.",
        "4": "I don't predetermined what is going on or how they're going to defend me.  I read and react.  They played me straight up in the post.  I just tried to make quick, solid moves to get into the paint.  If they brought help, I was still going to be able to find my guys. You know, whatever the defense is doing in that possession, I'm able to read and react and know what's going on.  I've seen every coverage, so definitely we have to be better in Game 2 because we know they're going to have some changes, and that's what the series is about, being able to adjust from game to game, and they're going to make adjustments, and we have to be ready for whatever.",
        "5": "Well, we didn't rest.  We just didn't have a game.  We didn't rest.  Coach Lue gave us one day off.  Other than that, we was in the gym working, keeping our rhythm, keeping our legs ready for whenever the game was -- whenever we was going to play, so we didn't rest.  We just didn't do -- we didn't have a game in front of cameras. Our whole mindset was whenever our game was going to present itself, we was going to be ready to play our game and do it the same way we've been doing that all postseason, and we were able to accomplish that tonight.",
        "6": "I don't think we have complacency in our minds right now.  We have a goal, and our goal was not nine wins.  It's just not my focus.  I've won nine games in the postseason before, won 14 games in the postseason before.  It's not my goal, and as the leader of this team, I'm going to continue to make sure that these guys understand what our goal is and they know.  They know what our goal is, and tonight was just another step in the direction that we want to head into. And we will face some adversity.  We will.  And we have to be able to handle that, which I think we'll be ready for.",
        "8": "Just having the opportunity to play the game that I love in front of some unbelievable fans and unbelievable teammates.  When you make plays like that, you know, it's the passion that came through.  It was the excitement that my teammates was getting, looking over at the bench, the other four guys on the floor and the 20,000-plus fans that was cheering it on at that point in time, so that's where it came from.  You don't know when it's going to happen.  Sometimes it just happens.  So yep.",
        "9": "Well, I think no gas, the Kyrie that I see on a daily basis when you guys are not around is the Kyrie that I envisioned.  He's grown every single day, every single week, month, and over the course of these last two years or year-plus, becoming a leader and becoming a staple of our team.  We all knew how talented the kid was and how talented he is still today, but his growth and what he demands out of all of us, you know, as the point guard, as one of the leaders of the team.  That's what's the best part about it.  I mean, you roll out a ball any single day of the week, and he'll play.  When you're that age, you can play as long as you want to anyways, but his growth, his mentality, and it's what's great about him right now.",
        "10": "Well, the game ball definitely goes to our bench tonight.  I mean, you look at plus-24, 20, 18, 17, all the way down, those guys gave us a boost in that second quarter, and I was out there with them.  But Channing, Shump, Delly and R.J., at that moment they pushed the tempo. You just got to work at it.  In practices we do a lot of work together, but we've got some very smart, cerebral players.  Coach Lue is able to mix and match some lineups that he feels best fits, and that's one of the lineups that's been working pretty good for us throughout this postseason that we did not -- like you said, did not use in the regular season.  So we've got to continue to work our habits.  It's not going to always be as great as it was tonight in the second quarter, where we outscored them 33-16, but we've got to continue to work at it and continue to see ways we can help each other, and if we do that, we'll be fine.

        "1": "LeBron, you had that one exchange with Kobe there where you're slapping the court, put your arms out.  What was that exchange for you?  And that seemed to be one of the few times somebody got in a defensive stance.  What was that like tonight? Le",
        "2": "To follow up on the Kobe stuff, was there any banter between you two that jumped out to you tonight? Le",
        "3": "As far as any interaction, talking and interaction? Le",
        "4": "When you came in, Kobe was already established as an All-Star and whatnot.  Has it sunk in really that this is the last time that you're going to be in an All-Star Game and Kobe Bryant will be there as well? Le",
        "5": "You're as familiar with this market as almost any NBA player.  What did you think people who might not have been as familiar with might have gained from the experience of having an All-Star outside of the U.S. and in this city in particular? Le",

        "0": "Oh, it absolutely means nothing.  It means absolutely nothing (smiling).  I'm just blessed to be a part of All-Star Weekend.  This being my 12th consecutive appearance, being able to start for the East, it means a lot to my family and my fans.  But the scoring, that's never meant nothing to me.",
        "1": "Oh, like I've been saying over the last week, it was Kobe's last game before the break was in Cleveland.  It was just bittersweet being out on the floor with him, knowing the matches between us two are coming to an end soon.  We've got one more in March in L.A.  But when you get that opportunity versus a great man, you just have fun with it.  I know it's been overwhelming for him over this year, but our fans across the world and here in the States and here in Toronto, as well, has just been paying so much respect.  It's all well deserved.  Man, I'm happy that I've been along for a small piece of the ride of his journey.",
        "2": "What does that word mean?",
        "3": "No, just small talk, man, but all in the favor of respect between each other.  We're very good friends, and I've been watching his journey for 20 years.  He's been keeping up on mine for 13.  So it's been pretty cool.",
        "4": "I don't think so.  If I'm fortunate enough to represent the East next year in a game by either being voted in or coach picks me, and I don't see him out there in Charlotte, I think that's when it will sink in.  But at this point, it hasn't sunk in yet.",
        "5": "First of all, to the people of Toronto, Canada, and all of Canada as a country, thanks for welcoming our league with open and warm arms.  Even though the weather wasn't as warm, the arms and the love from everyone here has been well received.  It's been a great All-Star Weekend from everything, from the community service that we've done, to the events that we did, to everything that had anything to do with our league. This is our biggest stage as far as when you get everyone together.  All 30 teams are here, plus our D-League, plus the WNBA, plus you just name it, everything that's associated with our shield is here this weekend.  And Toronto did a hell of a job of putting on a show, and it was an honor.",
        "6": "I don't believe he had surgery, personally (laughing).  It was just like, you know what, I'm just going to take a little bit of time off.  No, but it's been incredible, man.  Just like you said, to have three knee surgeries and he hasn't really lost -- he hasn't lost.  He's actually gained a step or two or three.  He's one of the most athletic guys that our league has seen and obviously in today's game as well.  He's a phenomenal talent.  You don't come across these guys that often and in our sport.",
        "7": "Oh, well, it was going as planned.  If the game would have gotten a little closer, he would have put me back in the game.  I think from his standpoint, he'd rather me not play as much, knowing what's ahead of us.  But minutes were down, but it felt good just to be out there in the minutes that I played and be able to cheer on the rest of my All-Stars while I was sitting out.",
        "8": "My favorite Kobe moment from tonight?  I just think, wow, there were so many.  I think the introduction that Magic gave and then him going and talking to the fans here.  He got an opportunity to just thank the fans here.  And the game has given him so much over these 20 years.  To have an opportunity to be able to make a contribution to the Jumbotron, to the video, that meant a lot for me.  It meant a lot to him as well, and he voiced that to me.",
        "9": "Well, those are my nephews.  D-Wade's two boys and Melo's boys, and I wanted them to be a part of it just like we were.  And I was able to take one of the seats from one of the ushers and made him stand up for the rest of the game and allowed my nephews to sit on the bench.  So those guys are going to be around the game for a long time, and they're now at an age, along with my two sons and also CP's son where they actually understand -- they're starting to understand what's actually going on now.  I think it's pretty cool for them to experience something like this, experience this weekend and see what their fathers have been able to do up to this point.  Thanks.

        "1": "One thing about this business is you can only control what you can control.  Things that you can't control, you can't let it bother you, and I've learned that over the years.  There is so much that goes on in professional sports that if you just focus on what you can control, everything else will take care of itself.",
        "2": "Every piece we have means a lot to the process, obviously with myself, and Kyrie and Kev, we kind of spearhead the whole thing.  If we're focused on the main thing and knowing what the main thing is every day, then we give ourselves a great chance.",
        "3": "Well, I mean, I feel for any one of my friends.  Obviously it's well-documented that Carmelo and Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul are my three best guys that we have around this league.  I felt for CP last year in the postseason.  I felt for D-Wade with all the injuries he's had.  Last year having a rough season, not making the playoffs.  I feel for Melo, when anything happens with those guys, and it's all reciprocated through the four of us.  So I want the best and most high success for all three of them.",
        "4": "You just said it, sustained.  He doesn't get caught up in the new age point guard.  He's a true (Indiscernible) he just works and works and works on his craft.   It's always great to see him be here, and this being his ninth time.  He's a special kid.",
        "5": "Just consistency from a mental side of things.  The game of basketball is more mental than anything, especially when you start getting to the postseason.  The top 16 teams make the postseason for a reason, but whatever record that you have at that point goes down the drain.  Everyone starts at zero and zero, and it's about the mental side of the game that kind of gets you over the hump. So as we continue to do what Coach Lue and the coaching staff want us to do, and mentally prepare ourselves for the long haul, then we'll be fine.",
        "6": "Consistency and no complacency.  I think they've used last year to just take them to another height.  Obviously, with Steph and Draymond and Klay, they spearhead the whole thing.  But everybody else falls into place, from Iggy to Barbosa to Barnes to Bogut, along all the way down.  Those guys fall into place.  They know their roles.  They know what they need to do out there every single night, and they play.  They play their roles individually as how they should play.  And they don't step outside that box.  That's what makes them so good.",
        "7": "I'm in a very good place as far as where I would like to be as far as us changing our pace and us playing faster.  The worst thing that could have happened to us is the All-Star break.  Seven days, we haven't played since Wednesday.  We won't play against until Thursday.  So that's the worst thing that could happen. But we have a veteran ball club, and I know guys will take a couple days off, which they should, and then at least get some cardio in.  I'm not expecting guys to be back on the floor, because staying off the floor is probably what's most beneficial for our team right now.  But getting some work in so we know when we come back Wednesday or Tuesday for practice we're ready to go.",
        "8": "Only thing that changed is the city, and some of that has been the same.  I've been to Houston, New Orleans and L.A. twice.  This is our biggest stage.  This is the NBA, it's our biggest stage.  It's the most media coverage that we're going to get.  We have all the greatest athletes and greatest fans here in one venue, and it's always an honor to be here.",
        "9": "I hope not.  I hope not.  I give a lot to the game.  My craft and what I dedicate to the game on a daily basis, I hope I'm not taken for granted.  I put so much into not only what I want to do out there, but for my teammates and for my fans and things of that nature.  So I hope that I'm appreciated in what I do.",
        "10": "Well, first of all, it's bittersweet that this is Kobe's last All-Star Game.  I remember when I was a youngster, I think I was in the 10th or 11th grade and I was watching MJ's last All-Star Game, so it kind of has that same feeling. You know, we have so many great athletes in our game, it's never one guy that carries the whole load.  Our game is made up of so many different make-ups, so many different countries, so many different players, shapes, sizes, that we all do our part and make sure the shield is protected.

Right after the game was over, I started watching cartoons with my kids.  As late as it was, we started watching cartoons and I didn't even see the postgame interview. All I can say from my experience is it's tough to come after a loss and then have to answer questions about it.  But you go up there, you handle it.  You handle it the best way you can.  You give credit to the opponent.  For me, who has been on both sides of winning and losing, when I lost I said, well, we've got some things to clean up, and hopefully we put ourselves in position to compete next year and go from there.  But I can't comment on Cam's experience because I didn't see it, and I'm not him.",
        "3": "Well, I mean, at the end of the day, it's just tough to lose in anything that you do.  You've got to be able to just go up there and accept it and take it.  Sometimes you make mistakes.  We all make mistakes.  That's how you learn, that's all.",
        "4": "Well, for me, I haven't quite decided if I'm on the fence of going or not.  But I've always loved representing my country.  I've been playing in the Olympic games since 2004.  So, no, I haven't made a decision yet.",
        "5": "I think it's great.  He would have been here anyways.  I heard some rookies say why would Coach Lue accept the fact to come to the All-Star Game?  Well, he would have been here anyways.  Even if Coach Blatt would have been our coach, Coach Lue would still be here.  So I think it's pretty cool that our coaching staff is here representing our organization.  I know he's going to have a great time with it.",

        "7": "Did you at any point feel the series shift?Ã‚Â  And if you felt that shift, were you concerned at the time that there wouldn't be an adjustment that the Cavs can make?",
        "8": "LeBron, we learned a little bit more about your, I guess, training regimen throughout the course of these playoffsÂ  Basically it's a twoâ€‘month process you go through with mental and physical preparationÂ  When you don't get the championship, is there any sense ofâ€‘â€‘ do you question whether it's all worth it?Ã‚Â  Or can you just have satisfaction in the process?",
        "9": "First of all, congrats on the seasonÂ  Secondly, would you say that this is the most disappointing of the four losses in The Finals?",
        "10": "I meant because of the comeback, the fact that you came back here and decided to make it your home again?",
        "11": "LeBron, everybody on the Warriors agreed that defending you was the toughest job in basketballÂ  What was your impression of what kind of job Andre Iguodala did, and what was his effect on the series?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, I mean, we had many chaptersÂ  We had many chapters in the seasonÂ  I don't knowÂ  I mean, for me, it's never a success if you go out losingÂ  But I think we put ourselves back where this franchise needs to be, being a contenderÂ  But we've still got a lot of work to do.",
        "1": "Well, I think you even go before that, losing Andy, one of our heartbeats of our team, another playmaker for our teamÂ  Then you lose Kev, an Allâ€‘Star, and then you lose Kyrie, another Allâ€‘Star. Tried as much as we could to try to make up for those guys, but it's a lot of talent sitting in suitsÂ  I've had a lot of playoff runs, been on both ends, and I know one thing that you've got to have during the playoff run, you've got to be healthyÂ  You've got to be healthyÂ  You've got to be playing great at the right timeÂ  You've got to have a little luckÂ  And we were playing great, but we had no luck and we weren't healthy.",
        "2": "My family is happyÂ  That makes my job a lot easierÂ  For the fans, I go out and try to just leave it all on the floor and hope it's enough.",
        "3": "There's not much you can say reallyÂ  I mean, you get to this point, and I've been on the short end of this four times, and I've been able to win it twiceÂ  It's really no great feeling when you lose. Only thing you can do is just try to pick yourself back up whenever that time may be and then just go at it againÂ  I'm a guy who is just trying to be successful in whatever I do, and I give everything to my teammates, give everything to the coaching staff. When you fall short, it hurts and it eats at you, and it hurts me to know that I wish I could have done better and done more and just put a little bit more effort or whatever the case may be to help us get over the humpÂ  But it just wasn't our time.",
        "4": "I haven't thought about next season at all.",
        "5": "Yeah, when the numbers went to zero and we lost tonightÂ  That's when I doubtedÂ  That's when it was overÂ  I mean, obviously, I knew it was going to be a tough task, and I continued to tell you guys we were undermannedÂ  I don't know any other teamâ€‘â€‘ I've been watching basketball for a long timeÂ  I'm an historian of the gameÂ  I don't know any other team that's gotten to The Finals without two Allâ€‘StarsÂ  I cannot remember thinking of itÂ  I can't remember in the backâ€‘â€‘ I don't even know if it's ever happened, for a team to lose two Allâ€‘Stars and still be able to make it to The Finals. Even what Andy brings to our team as well, that's another doubleâ€‘double guyÂ  We had three playmakers in suits this round and even throughout the playoffsÂ  You've got to have all the playmakersÂ  You've got to be healthyÂ  You've got to be at full strength to win itÂ  We weren'tÂ  We just wasn't.",
        "6": "Well, I mean, I enjoy the competitionÂ  And whatever it takes throughout the competition I'm fine withÂ  I don't enjoy being as nonâ€‘efficient as I wasÂ  I don't enjoy thatÂ  I don't enjoy dribbling the ball for countless seconds on the shot clock and the team looking at me to make a playÂ  We had 14 assists tonightÂ  I had nine of themÂ  I did not enjoy thatÂ  That's not winning basketball. Like I said, we had two bigâ€‘time playmakers on the sidelineÂ  We've got another one that's been out since early in the seasonÂ  And it was what I had to do. Ã‚Â It was what was neededÂ  If I could have gave more, I would have done it, but I gave everything I had.",
        "7": "I feltâ€‘â€‘ I mean, it was a great series up untilâ€‘â€‘ they blew the game open in the fourth in Game 5, but we had a chance thereÂ  Tonight we had our chances, but, you know, we ran out of talentÂ  We ran out of talent tonightÂ  We gave everything we hadÂ  The guys played as hard as they could as long as we could. But that team across the way, you tip your hats to themÂ  I cannot remember a team like them being healthy all year for the most partÂ  All the guys, I mean, they did a great jobÂ  Guys being healthy, guys playing their system, and it showed in these Finals.",
        "8": "Well, of course you question it, especially when you get to this pointÂ  I always look at it would I rather not make the playoffs or lose in The Finals?Ã‚Â  I don't knowÂ  I don't knowÂ  I've missed the playoffs twiceÂ  I lost in The Finals four timesÂ  I'm almost starting to be like I'd rather not even make the playoffs than to lose in The FinalsÂ  It would hurt a lot easier if I just didn't make the playoffs and I didn't have a shot at it. But then I lock back in and I start thinking about how fun it is to compete during the playoffs and the first round, the second round, and Eastern Conference FinalsÂ  If I'm lucky enough to get here again, it will be fun to do it. But put my body through a lot, you know, but it's the price for your body feeling this way for winningÂ  Did I win?Ã‚Â  I didn't win a championship, but I've done a lot of good things in this first year back, and hopefully I can continue it.",
        "9": "All four of them are disappointingÂ  It's not one that's higher or lower or in the middleÂ  You don't win, it's disappointingÂ  It's not just one is bigger than the other.",
        "10": "No, you lose in The Finals, they're all disappointingÂ  Doesn't matter if I'm playing in Miami or playing in Cleveland or playing on MarsÂ  You lose The Finals, it's disappointing.",
        "11": "Well, I think the last couple games he played wellÂ  He played great, especially offensivelyÂ  He made us defend himÂ  He knocked down open shotsÂ  Defensively, it's never a oneâ€‘onâ€‘one battleÂ  Guys get caught up in this whole oneâ€‘onâ€‘one thing, and it's never a oneâ€‘onâ€‘one battleÂ  Every time I'd get past him, another guy would step up, Draymond Green or whatever the case may be. It's never oneâ€‘onâ€‘oneÂ  It's notâ€‘â€‘ this isn't Bird versus Magic or that old video game, Jordan versus Bird, or whatever the case may beÂ  There's no oneâ€‘onâ€‘oneÂ  But I think his ability to play multiple positions for their team along with some of those other guys allowed their team to be so dynamic. He made us payÂ  He made us pay tonight with big shots, timely shots, getting out on the break, getting rebounds, getting assistsÂ  He was pretty good for their team.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, there was a play in the stretch you guysâ€‘â€‘ the Warriors were at the charity stripe, they got a couple offensive rebounds at that pointÂ  I remember you motioned over and it seemed like you asked to get a big in that situationÂ  Can you talk about how difficult that was for you guys to play small and those offensive rebound?",
        "1": "J.R. got off to a good startÂ  I think he had four of his first seven threes there and then he went quiet againÂ  What do you think happened with him?Ã‚Â  Was that just the game kind of flowed away from him, or what did you see happen with him?",
        "2": "LeBron and Tristan, LeBron, you gave, I would say, everything you had there, 40, 14, and 11, and you still come up shortÂ  For both of you, how do you cope with that, when you have games like that that you guys usually win?",
        "3": "Obviously, like you just said, you guys will be on the cusp of elimination on TuesdayÂ  But obviously you don't want the Warriors celebrating on your home floorÂ  So how do you rally your teammates, and what will be your message to them before Game 6?",
        "5": "The fourth quarter has gone their way pretty well the last two gamesÂ  Is it fatigue, the depth thing, or is it just execution problems?Ã‚Â  What's going on in those last couple nights?",
        "6": "You said hopefully you can do a little more the next game outÂ  How much more can you possibly do given what you've been putting in in this series, and do you ever recall having to extend yourself this far in a series?",
        "7": "You seem to be playing a lot more comfortable this Finals seriesÂ  There was a play I think you had a behindâ€‘theâ€‘back layâ€‘up where you went up and you're making crazy threesÂ  Do you feel a lot less pressure this Finals run just because you are undermanned and you had some injuries as opposed to previous years?",
        "8": "In regards to pressure with the games playing, do you feel as if this Finals team, it's a little less?",
        "9": "In particular, the half court one, the almost half court one, that was somewhat crazy?",
        "10": "Would you agree?",
        "11": "You mentioned giving up some offensive rebounds and the secondâ€‘chance points that they got as a teamÂ  You guys usually are doing that to other teamsÂ  Was there any sort of a deflating feeling when they were able to keep coming up with those offensive rebounds?",
        "13": "LeBron, do you feel that at this moment of this series, this roster, the roster you guys have right now, do you remember like those Cavaliers X teams where you had to do it all but it wasn't enough, your previous Cavaliers teams?",
        "14": "So this is different?",
        "15": "LeBron, do you feel like the smaller lineup hurt you guys defensively tonight?Ã‚Â  The Golden State Warriors shot 48 percent against you guys?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, I mean, at the end of the day no matter who is on the floor, we have to come up with that reboundÂ  That's what it isÂ  We just have to come up with the rebound no matter if Double T or Mozzy are not in the gameÂ  We've got to come up with those reboundsÂ  That just can't happen at the freeâ€‘throw line.",
        "1": "I don't know what happened with himÂ  I mean, we kept going to himÂ  He just missed some shotsÂ  He came out aggressive, which we wanted him to doÂ  We kept finding himÂ  He started off well, he just cooled downÂ  It's just a makeâ€‘orâ€‘miss league. He took some great shotsÂ  Some of them was in a rhythm, and some of themâ€‘â€‘ after he hit a few, he loves to go to the heat check, and we're all okay with that, and he just missed them.",
        "2": "Well, you cope with it by understanding it's just one game and looking at the opportunity we have on Tuesday to force a Game 7Â  Obviously, for myself, I want to do whatever it takes to help our team win, and I haven't been able to do that the last two. So hopefully I can do a better job coming in on TuesdayÂ  We all as a unit can do a better job, and we'll be fine. TRISTAN THOMPSON:Ã‚Â  Piggyback on what LeBron said, just watch film and figure out areas we can do better atÂ  For me, rebound a little better, guard my man a little better, and just don't have mental breakdowns. But like he said, we've got to go home and get a win and force a Game 7.",
        "3": "Well, we don't want them celebrating at all, no matter if it's on our home floor or their home floorÂ  We've come this far, and we've been very good at homeÂ  We have to understand why we weren't good in Game 4Â  We had a lack of energyÂ  We had a lack of effort in a lot of areas in Game 4, and we can't repeat that or they'll raise the trophy for sure.",
        "5": "I think tonight, obviously, Steph got it goingÂ  He hit some huge shots which kept us at bayÂ  They got a couple of offensive rebounds that didn't work to our favorÂ  You know, we needed our best defensive quarter tonight in the fourth quarter, and we didn't get itÂ  We gave up 31 points in the fourthÂ  Some of them were free throws, but a lot of them were them just breaking us downÂ  So we've got to do a better job of that.",
        "6": "I don't knowÂ  I don't put a ceiling on what I can doÂ  I don't knowÂ  I mean, tonight I gave up two offensive reboundsâ€‘â€‘ one to Barbosa in the first half, one to Harrison Barnes, which allowed him to get an andâ€‘one with Iguodala with the leftâ€‘hand trick shot. I had a couple turnovers, a couple miscues defensively, and I've got to be betterÂ  I don't knowÂ  Like I said, I don't put a ceiling on what I'm capable of doingÂ  I know I'm shouldering a lot of the burden, but it is what it is.",
        "7": "NoÂ  No, I feel confident because I'm the best player in the worldÂ  It's that simple.",
        "8": "No, I mean, it's The FinalsÂ  It's something you dream of when you're a kidÂ  For me, I put the work inÂ  I put the work in every single day, either when you guys are there, either when you're not thereÂ  Some of our beat writers see meÂ  They know how much work I put into it, and I give everything to my teammates. When you're true to the game, it doesn't matter if it's a regular season game or a Finals game, you just go out and trust what you put into the game and you live with the resultsÂ  So shouldn't be crazy when I make threes, thoughÂ  It's just a shot.",
        "9": "Okay.",
        "10": "All right (laughing).",
        "11": "When you're going up against a highâ€‘offensiveâ€‘power team like this, to get them to miss, it's very deflating when they get a secondâ€‘chance point or a secondâ€‘chance crackÂ  Even when they don't make it, they're looking for those three pointers, they're looking for Klay and Steph when they get offensive reboundsÂ  So those are very deflating. But we've got to do a better job of hitting bodies, coming over the ballÂ  They're going to get offensive rebounds because they shoot a lot of jump shots and a lot of long rebounds, but when that happens, we've got to match up very quickly and not allow them to make shots.",
        "13": "NopeÂ  Nope we're going home with a Game 6, and we've got enough to win itÂ  We protect home we come hereÂ  We'll worry about Tuesday firstÂ  But if we protect home like we're capable of doing, we force a Game 7.",
        "14": "I feel confident.",
        "15": "Well, there are a lot of things that hurt us tonightÂ  Steph being one of themÂ  That had nothing to do with going smallÂ  I think we were much more active tonight than we were in Game 4. And some of the shots that they made, like I said, some of the shots that Steph made, you've got to tip your hat to a guy like thatÂ  I mean, he's between, behind, crossover, stepback threes, with a contest, you're okay with thatÂ  That had nothing to do with us being small. When we don't get back in transition, those are things we can clean upÂ  When we get offensive rebounds on free throws, those are things we can clean upÂ  Those are things that can hurt youÂ  But it had nothing to do with us being smallÂ  Whoever's in the game needs to do their job and do it at a high level, do it to the best of their ability and you live with the aftermath after that.

    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "0": "You in The Finals, your team has seen the opposition make changes to the lineupÂ  With Barea with Dallas in 2011, they put Diaw in last year in the starting lineup, and Iggy the other night, what is the adjustment period like for the opposition when a team that's been doing it one way and you've been scouting them one way makes that change late?",
        "1": "Have you found that it's an adjustment that is quick once you've seen it once, or is it something that can linger for two or three games before you can pick it up?",
        "2": "The numbers in this series are what they areÂ  In the first three you averaged 41 points, you almost won all three gamesÂ  The other night 20, and you lost by 20 or whateverÂ  Are you in a spot now where you have to score huge numbers for this team to win?",
        "3": "How much really does an extra day of rest help?Ã‚Â  How much better do you feel after two days of rest when you've almost played 100 games this season?",
        "4": "In what stage of your career did weightlifting and strength become kind of an essential part of your game to where you can take some of the fouls, the nonâ€‘fouls that you take?",
        "5": "There's been guys who came into the league with you that are not in the league anymore from injuries or whateverÂ  So has it extended your career, you would say?Ã‚Â  Has it made you a stronger player?",
        "6": "I know the shots didn't fall the other night from the perimeterÂ  But were you guys happy with the shots that you got, though?",
        "7": "Do you hear a lot of game momentum, momentum this and that?Ã‚Â  Do you believe in momentum between games and who do you think has it?",
        "8": "J.R. just mentioned over there that the good thing for him is he feels he can't get any worseÂ  What is it about him that gives you the confidence that he can and will respond?",
        "9": "They played the small ball last game to win the gameÂ  How do you adjust to it?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, it's an adjustment for sureÂ  It's much more of an adjustment on the fly because you're not quite sure that a team is going to do that, so you've been preparing for a certain lineup and they're able to make the switchÂ  So it kind of makes the lineups and the preparation a little bit different for the guys that are covering him. In this case with our big, Timo and Tristan, Timo's starting off on Iggy, it's a different matchâ€‘up than Bogut, obviouslyÂ  You've got a guy that's primarily on the perimeter in Game 4 versus guarding a guy that's always in the paint, for the most part, unless he's initiating offense. So it's definitely a different change for usÂ  But I think we'll be much more prepared for it tomorrow night if they go with the same lineup.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, it's not that quickÂ  Obviously you don't have many games to allow it to linger, and hopefully you can get comfortable with itÂ  But I think our coaching staff, if we're not in tune with what's going on or we're not ready for the speed or the action, we'll be able to make the sub and make the proper adjustments in game instead of waiting for it after.",
        "2": "Well, I'm in a spot where I have to be very productive, and that's just the spot I've always been inÂ  For me, from the perception, it's a loseâ€‘lose when it comes to, okay, well, in the first three games I score 40, but I shoot a lot of shotsÂ  Last game I scored 20, I don't shoot as many shots, and we loseÂ  So it's like what do you want? So for me that's not myâ€‘â€‘ that's not my thought processÂ  I don't really care about itÂ  All I care about is how I can produce for our teamÂ  And if that's going out and trying to put up 40 or if it's putting up 35 shot attempts or if it'sâ€‘â€‘ at the time, if we can win by me taking 22 shots as well, then you just play the game and see how it can affect your team.",
        "3": "Well, any little rest you can get throughout the postseason run, I mean, it's like a lifelineÂ  For us to be able to get this extra day to mentally and physically prepare for tomorrow night or tomorrow day is definitely helpful.",
        "4": "I think in my fifth year, my fifth, sixth year when I started to have some back problemsÂ  I think a lot of it had to do with me not properly taking care of my body the right way. I came into the league at 18, so weightlifting at 18, 19, 20, 21 really didn't mean much to meÂ  But I started to make the postseasonÂ  I started making good runs, and I felt my body started to get tired during the postseasonÂ  And I felt like it was time for me to do something to help my body not only be ready for the physical, but more the stress and the long haul of the season that it provided.",
        "5": "Well, everything that I've done has extended my careerÂ  I mean, I takeâ€‘â€‘ I really take care of my body to where if I even have a slight injury I'm able to come back a little bit faster than some maybe because it's what helped me get out on the floor every night. It's very important to meÂ  My diet and how I eat is very important to meÂ  How much I lift and how much I train is very important to meÂ  Then how much you allow the body to rest as well. Obviously, it's not as much rest as you would like, but sometimes you have to just get off your feet as well, just to give your body time to recoverÂ  So I found a great balance where I know what my body can take, I know what it can't take and get me trying to play at a high level.",
        "6": "Yes and noÂ  I think some of the shots that we got we were happy about, but some of them that we took we weren't happy aboutÂ  I think we allowed their lineup to get us out of what we did in Games 1, 2, and 3, and that was control the pace and put the ball into the postÂ  We shot 27 threes. So I would say half of those or even more than half were some good shots, but a few of them we wish we could have back.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, it depends on the situationÂ  It depends on how the game was playedÂ  It depends on the two teamsÂ  I think when you get to a championship levelâ€‘type game with it being 2â€‘2, I don't think anyone has the momentumÂ  Obviously, everyone would say them because they're coming back home and then after the game they had the other night, but the momentum starts once the game starts. We'll see who can put the most possessions together, who can make the most plays and put themselves and their team in a position to win.",
        "8": "Well, I think the main thing with J.R. and for me as a leader, I don't care how many shots he missedÂ  I don't want his head to be down like it was in Game 4Â  It's a make or miss leagueÂ  J.R. practices enoughÂ  We all are all professional athletes and we practice on our craftÂ  But you can never allow someone either from the media or from the fans, from the opposition, from your family to ever see that you're down about what you're doingÂ  It doesn't matterÂ  He has to stay confident. He can miss a hundred shotsÂ  If they're great looks, they're driveâ€‘andâ€‘kicks, you shoot them with confidenceÂ  If he's feeling confident about his ability, then I'm confident about itÂ  But onceâ€‘â€‘ as a competitor, once you lose confidence in yourself, then it's really not much coming back from thatÂ  So if he's confident in himself, he'll be fine.",
        "9": "Well, I mean, they started small ball, but they've played a lot of small ball all yearÂ  It's the luxury that Coach Kerr has with the type of personnel that he has where he's able to slide Draymond Green to the five and play smallÂ  That's a luxury of having a guy like Draymond and having that type of personnel where he can play that type of basketball and still be effective. We're going to play our gameÂ  We've gotten to this point by playing the way we play, and we're not going to changeÂ  We'll make adjustments throughout the game, but we won't change our starting lineup.

      "questions": {
        "0": "You've talked all series about being undermanned and overmatchedÂ  So tonight Golden State comes outÂ  They make an adjustment with their starting lineupÂ  They feel like they've changed the paceÂ  Are you, as a team, in a position where you can make an adjustment, or are you confined to just go with what you have?",
        "1": "When you went down and hit your head, one, how are you feeling now?Ã‚Â  Two, did you think that you'd have to go through any sort of concussion test or anything like that at the time?",
        "2": "LeBron, you mentioned you guys don't have a lot of lineups you can go to right nowÂ  But when a guy like J.R. Smith is struggling how he is, how difficultâ€‘â€‘ how much pressure does that put on everybody else?Ã‚Â  And what can you do or what can you say to try to help him through this?",
        "3": "In the fourth quarter after you guys had cut that 12â€‘point halftime deficit down to six, you're out of the game for the first couple minutes and they put you back to double digitsÂ  What goes through your mind there?Ã‚Â  Do you feel like you can't even come out of the game?",
        "4": "Just to follow up on that, the coach talked about how he felt maybe the schedule was really starting to fatigue the sideÂ  Can you talk to that?Ã‚Â  And also I've got to ask you specifically about the man earlier in the week, Delly, do you think his hospital visit had an impact on his performance tonight?",
        "5": "LeBron, they talk about you getting stitches or anything like that?Ã‚Â  Is that a possibility?Ã‚Â  Two, do you think you guys are going to have to go deeper on the bench and play more guys just toâ€‘â€‘ you guys kind of looked like your legs were heavy tonight.",
        "6": "How many stitches?",
        "7": "Steve Kerr said Iguodala has been his best player in this seriesÂ  This was the first game he started all season longÂ  What did you think his impact was tonight?",
        "8": "Did you feel like they did anything differently defensively against you or was it mostly straight up still, or did they shade guys toward you as you got in the lane?",
        "9": "They talked a lot about trying to increase the pace the past few daysÂ  Do you think there was anything they were effective in doing that or, again, is that a product of you guys not making shots and allowing them to get out?",
        "10": "J.R. Smith has really been struggling throughout this whole seriesÂ  Today, 0â€‘fromâ€‘8 from the threeâ€‘point lineÂ  Do you think maybe bringing him back to the starting five will be the right step to build up his confidence?",
        "11": "Your fans started to leave the arena five minutes before the game was overÂ  Your comment about that?",
        "12": "At the start of the game they took out Andrew Bogut and went with Iguodala in the starting lineupÂ  What kind of challenges does their small ball lineup present to you guys?",
        "13": "Three games leftÂ  How are you going to be able to overcome the utter physical and mental exhaustion that you're feeling?",
        "14": "Two questionsÂ  One, did you have to go through any concussion protocol things?Ã‚Â  Was there any thought that you might have something like that?Ã‚Â  And the second one would be you guys are two games away from winning a titleÂ  Just living here, feeling that in the city of Cleveland, what's that been like for you the last couple of days?",
        "15": "Draymond Green was just in here and he said this Finals has been a street fightÂ  So to use a boxing analogy, you guys are moving into the championship roundsÂ  You have a lot of Finals experience; a lot of your teammates do notÂ  As a leader, how do you keep their confidence up for these last three games for this fight?",
        "16": "The series is tied now going to Golden StateÂ  Do you feel that this is the biggest challenge of your career so far?Ã‚Â  How do you feel about maybe thinking about letting this one go at home?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We don't have many options as far as lineups we can go to, but we can make adjustmentsÂ  That's what you do throughout a seriesÂ  We'll get to the film and make the necessary adjustments coming into Game 5Â  But as far as lineup changes, we don't have many different lineup changes we can actually go to.",
        "1": "I was just trying to regain my composure, and I was holding my headÂ  It was hurtingÂ  I was just hoping I wasn't bleedingÂ  But obviously the camera cut me pretty badÂ  Our medical staff did a great job of stopping the bleeding. I knew I had to shoot the free throws or I wasn't going to be able to come back into the game, so it didn't matter what was going on with my head at that point in timeÂ  I had to go up there and shoot those free throws so I could continue to play.",
        "2": "I don't put too much pressure on anyone elseÂ  You continue to stick with themÂ  We all struggle at timesÂ  We all have a couple games here, a couple games there we won't play so wellÂ  We know we can help the team, but just not falling for us. But you don't give up on anyoneÂ  We all got to this point together, and you stick with themÂ  He's been huge for our team all yearÂ  We wouldn't be at this point without himÂ  So hopefully he can get it going, which we believe.",
        "3": "Oh, well, I was hoping our team could buy me a few minutesÂ  I ran through those 12 minutes in the third, and I gassed outÂ  Just tried to put us in a positionâ€‘â€‘ Steph hit a bigâ€‘time three at the end of the third, put them up six, I missed one, but I was pretty much gassed either from driving, creating opportunities for my teammates, getting to the freeâ€‘throw line, getting offensive glass, just trying to make that push. And I was hoping our team could just buy me a couple minutesÂ  We weren't able to do that tonight in the fourth quarter, and, I mean, it's difficultÂ  You want to be out there, but also you don't want to beâ€‘â€‘ you want to be effective while you're out there tooÂ  So they made a huge run, and we just couldn't regather after that.",
        "4": "No, I mean, no excusesÂ  The schedule is what it isÂ  We knew that coming into the seriesÂ  We knew it was going to be every other day when we got home, and those guys were going to have two days in between when they went homeÂ  But I think defensively we were still very goodÂ  Offensively we were terribleÂ  You can't alwaysâ€‘â€‘ you can't always bank on your offenseÂ  Sometimes your offense just doesn't show up, and there is no way we go 4â€‘forâ€‘27 from the threeâ€‘point line and expect to win. We outrebounded them stillÂ  We had 16 offensive reboundsÂ  We had 20 secondâ€‘chance pointsÂ  But we just couldn't get the long ball going tonight, and that definitely hurtâ€‘â€‘ our offense hurt us just as bad as anything. As far as Delly, I think Delly said he felt greatÂ  We thought he was greatÂ  He just didn't make shots, and that's what happens sometimes.",
        "5": "Well, I already got the stitchesÂ  Obviously, you can't see themÂ  That's the coach's decision if he decides he wants to go deeper in the benchÂ  We haven't played many guys throughout this playoff runÂ  I think it would help some of the guys that are playing some high minutes for sureÂ  Just give guys a couple minutes here, a couple minutes thereÂ  But I think the coaching staff will try to do what's best to help us be physically and mentally prepared for Sunday.",
        "6": "Enough to close it up.",
        "7": "He's one of the Xâ€‘factors, and he came to playÂ  He shot the ball extremely wellÂ  He hit four threesÂ  He was in attackÂ  He got a couple dunks in transition early on in the game which got him going, and he was really good for them. Coach Kerr did a great job of mixing the lineup upÂ  They have so many different interchangeable players where he can kind of decide how he wants to go with his lineups in that nature, and to start him tonight gave them that boost.",
        "8": "No, they doubled me a little bit more tonightÂ  They kind of made me get a ball up, seeing if some of my teammates can beat those guys. Like I said, we couldn't make any shots from the outside, but we'll take those looks againÂ  Those guys, my guys did a great job just stepping into them, trying to make them being confident about themÂ  But when you go 4â€‘forâ€‘27 from the threeâ€‘point line, there's not much success offensively.",
        "9": "Yeah, their pace has been pretty good all seriesÂ  It's just that we've made shots and we've made them take the ball out of the basket instead of getting it off a reboundÂ  Tonight we shot 33 percent from the fieldÂ  So when you're getting the ball off the glass or you're getting the ball off the rim, your pace is much better than when you're taking the ball off the netÂ  So it's just a product of us not shooting the ball well at all.",
        "10": "That's a decision I think Coach Blatt and the coaching staff will either make or not makeÂ  He's been great for us coming off the benchÂ  He's been great for us startingÂ  So we'll seeÂ  We'll see what the coaches have him playingÂ  We're going to go with him, we'll continue to give him the ballÂ  He's a spark for our team, whether he's in the starting role or not.",
        "11": "I don't have any comment about itÂ  I mean, I came out of the game as well earlyÂ  So we were on the same page.",
        "12": "Well, obviously, you're going to have a lot of guys on the perimeterÂ  When your big is accustomed to guarding a big for three straight games and there is a change, now our big, meaning Timo, has to make a changeÂ  He has to guard a smaller guy, which he's not been accustomed to everÂ  So he definitely gave us a little different look defensively to start the game. We still started the game pretty wellÂ  We were up 7â€‘0, but Steph making the three, Iguodala hits the three, Harrison Barnes makes one, Draymond hits oneÂ  And they offensively got it goingÂ  They got in a rhythm, and you could start seeing it. It's something like I said, while it's going on, you kind of like:Ã‚Â  What do we do here?Ã‚Â  What do we do there?Ã‚Â  And that's what the days in between games are forÂ  You're able to look at the film and go from there and see ways you can just be better.",
        "13": "I mean, it's three games left possiblyÂ  You just go out and playÂ  You know you go out, you play hard. Coaching staff gives you a great game plan, you go out and execute it and live with the results at the end of the day. That's all you can askÂ  It's the biggest stage in the world, but I don't put too much added pressure on myself about basketballÂ  It's justâ€‘â€‘ that's all it isÂ  It's just basketball.",
        "14": "No, I didn't have to go through any concussion protocolÂ  I had a slight headache, which I think every last one of you guys would probably have if you ran into a cameraÂ  You might have a little bit more than thatÂ  But I didn't go through any protocolÂ  I'm fineÂ  Like I said, I got a few stitches and I got a little slight headache right now, but I'll be fine with that. I don't know if I get the feeling or not, because I don't really get involved in it, the whole thingÂ  I understand how important this city is and what I mean to this city and what our team means to the city as far as even with other professional sports teams that we have in this city, but I don't get caught up into itÂ  I just go out and play my gameÂ  I try to lead the best way I can, and if I can put my team and this franchise in a position to win the title, I'm grateful for that, and that's what I'm trying to do.",
        "15": "Well, I mean, if I told my teammates six months ago or whatever the case may be that it would be 2â€‘2 and we had an opportunity to be 2â€‘2 in The Finals going on the road, would you take it?Ã‚Â  With three games left, I think all of them would accept that, and that's what it's about. I mean, this is the biggest stageÂ  It's being covered by everyone in the world, and you should just be happy to go out and just competeÂ  Win, lose or draw, you go out and competeÂ  And that's all that should matter. It shouldn't matter what everyone is talking about or what everyone is putting pressure on you or things of that natureÂ  It means nothingÂ  I mean, in the scheme of thingsÂ  You go out and you play, and you've been playing basketball your whole lifeÂ  You live with the results after that.",
        "16": "You don't let any of them goÂ  Both teams are in The Finals for a reasonÂ  You can either look at it, okay, we stole home court and they stole it backÂ  Or you could look at it and say they won two on their floor; we won two on our floorÂ  It would be the same thingÂ  If they won Game 1 and Game 2 and we came home and protected home court, it would be 2â€‘2 and we're heading to Game 5. So the story line is differentÂ  It just depends on what day it is and how you guys want to write the story. Biggest challenge of my career was being down 3â€‘2 going into BostonÂ  That's probably the biggest challenge of my careerÂ  Game 5 at Golden State is not that big when it comes to going to Boston and you lose multiple times in that arena, and the franchise that I was with at the time had never won a playoff game in BostonÂ  Now that's pretty challengingÂ  So I've been through a little bit in my pretty cool career.

        "1": "One a little bit out of left fieldÂ  You're known as King JamesÂ  The Australian government has the power to knight citizens of our countryÂ  Would you endorse Sir Dellavedova?",
        "2": "We'll take that as a yes.",
        "3": "Could you describe just what this reunion has been like with the fans in Cleveland, considering the emotion was probably on the sour side when you left, and the way they've welcomed you, did you have any concern with how they'd embrace you once you got back?",
        "4": "Toughness, the word toughness in sports can mean so many different thingsÂ  What does it mean to you, and how does your definition of it relate to this team?",
        "5": "It's obvious the physical toll that this is taking on youÂ  How mentally taxing is this?Ã‚Â  I'm not sure we've ever seen you have to be so laser focused and calculating during games.",
        "6": "Could you talk a little bit about Delly, a followâ€‘up on kind of the junkyard dog attitude he brings to this team?",
        "7": "I'm sure you're aware of the historic performances in The FinalsÂ  Does it feel like something legendary is happening on the court, or is that something you'll be able to put in perspective when the series is over?",
        "8": "I haven't seen it yet, but a lot of people reading about it online last night, liked your segment with Dwyane WadeÂ  How would you assess his ability on our side of the room, and did he get the secret motivation?Ã‚Â  Did he find out the answer?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's really hard to describeÂ  You just try to give everything that you have to your teammates and live with the resultsÂ  You know, for me, I just try to put it all on the line to a point where win, lose or draw, you're satisfied with the outcome.",
        "1": "(Laughing)Â  That's pretty coolÂ  Whatever is in the favor of good for Delly, I'm all for itÂ  So whatever that guy wants or needs, I'm all for.",
        "2": "Yeah.",
        "3": "I think time heals allÂ  It was a bitter moment when I left the first time, but it's a sweet moment here now that I'm backÂ  Both sides had an opportunity to kind of miss each other, and they say if it's worth having and it's supposed to be there, then it will always come back. That's the example it is today, and I'm happy to be backÂ  I know the fans are excited and exuberant about me being backÂ  Not only just about me, this team, putting this team back in the position where they can compete and have something to talk about from our side, the basketball sideÂ  And it's been pretty cool so far.",
        "4": "Well, like you said, it could have so many different meanings from physical toughness to mental toughness, spiritual toughnessÂ  You have to be put in so many different examples and so many different forms and able to see the tough when it comes out. I think from our team, we have a little bit of it allÂ  Just the adversity that we faced not only in the postseason but all seasonÂ  The toughness as far as physical, the injuries that we faced. The ups and downs that we've had throughout the season, being 19 and 20 at one pointÂ  Now to making the trade and having to go through another tough transition, to our Allâ€‘Star forward being out for the seasonÂ  Now to our Allâ€‘Star point guard being out for the season, and that's being able to still stay at bay. It shows so many different forms of toughness that we've had throughout the season, and especially in the postseason.",
        "5": "Well, I don't knowÂ  You say how much it's taken out of meÂ  I want it to take it allÂ  Then after the game I'm able to kind of decompress for a little bit. Obviously I'm not getting much sleepÂ  You guys can see I'm not getting much sleep right now, but I'm okay with thatÂ  I'm okay with not sleeping to be able to prepare myself and mentally keep myself intact on what's the main objective for me right now, and that is to make sure that my guys are laser sharp, get myself mentally prepared, physically prepared to go out and battle. It's been a difficult challenge, a tough challenge, but I knew that. Ã‚Â Being the sole leader of a team and a franchise, it's taxing, but I accept the challengeÂ  I accept it all, and I'm okay with it.",
        "6": "Well, Delly comes from a rugby backgroundÂ  And if any of you guys ever have an opportunity to ever watch a rugby game, you see how tough it is, and that's what it's aboutÂ  He justâ€‘â€‘ he brings it allÂ  Everything that he has, he lays out on the floorÂ  I think he dove on the ground last night, an NBA Finals record, six times (laughing)Â  Last night, and last night he was on the ground again after the game in the hospital, so you could probably say seven times. He gives us everything that he has, and we all appreciate it as his brothers in the lineup beside him.",
        "7": "I truly don't feel itÂ  I don't go home and turn on the TV and watch highlights and watch the coverage of the gamesÂ  I went home last night and I turned on \"Chopped.\"Ã‚Â  I watched \"Chopped\" last night and then \"Teen Titans\" after that at 2:30 in the morning. So I don't really know what's going onÂ  I know we're up 2â€‘1Â  I know our team is fighting for our livesÂ  We're undermannedÂ  We're undermatched, and we're fightingÂ  That's all I knowÂ  Me and my brother Maverick, we always talk and say that at some point probably when I'm done we'll sit back and gather a lot of my playoff games, get a couple bottles of wine and enjoy it and watch it and say okay, those were some special timesÂ  But right now I don't feel it.",
        "8": "Well, first of all, it's great to always see him and be alongside himÂ  No matter if it's in a uniform or he's in a suit and I'm in street clothesÂ  I thought he was greatÂ  Obviously our chemistry is greatÂ  Obviously you guys knew you all could lull me in with himÂ  You guys used D Wade to get me thereÂ  Which is coolÂ  I understand thatÂ  I know. And he tried to get the secret motivation out of me, and I didn't give it to him either, even though I told himÂ  But he won't tell you guys, thoughÂ  He won't tell you all until hopefully after this is all over.

    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "0": "In the last minutes of the game you came up with a couple steals from StephÂ  One was off an inbounds play, and after that steal you started pointing at your head, maybe at your temple a little bitÂ  What was going on with that?",
        "1": "During this postseason you've had multiple guys step up aside of you and play wellÂ  Tonight it was the dynamic duo of you and DellavedovaÂ  When you look at what you guys were able to accomplish out there, was there a time on the court where you knew that you two guys had it going?",
        "2": "Could you talk a little bit about your teammates accepting their roles and their defensive intensity for this game?Ã‚Â  A lot of people are equating it to like the Allen Iverson, 76ers team that went to The Finals where you're handling the bulk of the scoring, but they're really locking down defensively knowing their roles and helping you out in a great way.",
        "3": "The other day you didn't like the suggestion that they were letting you get 40â€‘plus pointsÂ  Tonight Steph Curry was talking about how your 40 is not the problem, that it's just coming in with a high volume of shotsÂ  I'm just curious your reaction to that comment?",
        "4": "After Game 2, LeBron, you challenged the Cleveland crowd to come out here and match the intensity that you saw in Oakland in Games 1 and 2Â  How do you think the crowd helped out today?Ã‚Â  Did it help motivate you guys?Ã‚Â  Obviously you came out with big intensity.",
        "5": "Back to what you were talking aboutÂ  The efficiency is something that's one of the few ways where you'll consistently critique your own game even in a winÂ  Did you have to go through some sort of mind shift to kind of allow yourself to be okay with playing this way or get yourself to the point of playing this way?",
        "6": "Steve Kerr said that it felt like his team lacked life those first three quartersÂ  When you were out there during those first three quarters, did you get the sense that it was you guys sucking the life out of them?",
        "7": "LeBron, what you guys were able to do defensively to them, in the third quarter they only had 55 pointsÂ  It seemed like you kind of took the wind out of their sails a little bitÂ  Was that satisfying for you out on the floor seeing that you're almost able to break a team?",
        "8": "Can you please elaborate on your working relationship with Coach Blatt?Ã‚Â  Earlier this evening he said that he's not always know what you're going to do, but he's certain that you will do the right thingÂ  So can you please give us your side of this relationship?",
        "9": "Given all the adversity that you guys have faced here in the postseason, when you see Shump go down, leave the game and then come back and play with what nearly looks like one arm, what's that show you?",
        "10": "LeBron, is there a scarier opponent in the league than Steph when he gets going like that, especially at the end of a game?Ã‚Â  And, two, is there any concern going forward that he's found his rhythm and he's kind of found his shooting stroke a little bit?",
        "11": "In regard to that team defense, how much does it help during the playoffs that you've been able to dig into an opponent's tendencies in a series compared to the regular season where it's one game on to the next opponent?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, I just seen them run that set before, and I was telling the coaching staff that I was in tune and I knew it was coming.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, I know one thing I'm going to count on Delly as always is how hard he's going to playÂ  He's going to give everything he's gotÂ  His body, he's going to throw his body all over the placeÂ  And he's going to compete at a high level however many minutes he's out on the floor. Tonight it was 30 1/2 minutes, and for 30 1/2 minutes he gave everything he's gotÂ  It was great to have someone like that out on the floor that was willing to sacrifice everything for the better of the team.",
        "2": "Well, we said it from the beginning that in order for us to win, we have to defendÂ  My guys do a great job of coming out and defendingÂ  Everyone knows their role, and we all play our role to the best of our abilityÂ  We don't step outside our boxÂ  When you have that type of chemistry out on the floor, it makes everything work.",
        "3": "I don't have a reactionÂ  I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to help our team winÂ  If it's highâ€‘volume shooting, if it's high rebounding, if it's high assists, whatever it takes to help our team win. We're out two Allâ€‘Stars, and we're out a starting center, so I have to pick up some of the shot attemptsÂ  I'm not a highâ€‘volume guyÂ  I don't like to shoot highâ€‘volume shots, but it's The Finals, and it's whatever it takes. I don't have a comment for StephÂ  That's not my concernÂ  What my concern is how I come out and play, be aggressiveÂ  If it's highâ€‘volume shooting, I'm living in the paintÂ  I'll shoot 34 shots, but I only took six threes, and one of them was a heave at the end of a shot clockÂ  That lets me know I'm being aggressive.",
        "4": "AbsolutelyÂ  They were unbelievable from the start to the finishÂ  We fed off them, and we just tried to give it all back to them for 48 minutesÂ  As loud as they were, they need to go home now and start soaking up a lot of tea, drinking a lot of tea for the next 36 hours, whatever the case may be, because they need to be just as loud Thursday night. So I need you guys to get those voices rightÂ  But they're going to be unbelievable Thursday night as wellÂ  Those guys, everyone, they were amazing.",
        "5": "I mean, I'm not okay with itÂ  I'm not okay with it, but I'm so outside the box right nowÂ  I went seven straight seasons with improving my efficiencyÂ  Seven straight into this year, the previous seven seasons, seven straight seasons with improving my efficiency as far as shooting. But this is a different challengeÂ  This is a totally different challengeÂ  I've never played where two Allâ€‘Stars were outÂ  So it's a different challenge for myself, and it's outside the box, but it's not too farÂ  It's not far for me to go grabÂ  I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to helpÂ  I know you guys keep hearing me elaborate on whatever it takes, but that's what I'm trying to do. I'm highâ€‘volume shooting, but it's not like I'm going out there and I'm highâ€‘volume shooting and I'm not doing anything elseÂ  I'm doing everything for our team to help our team win, and that's all that matters.",
        "6": "No, I mean, I don't think those guys lacked lifeÂ  I think they came in and we just tried to put pressure on them like we've done the first three games, the first two games and then tonight. But those guys, they got a rhythm in the fourth quarterÂ  Part of it is because we allowed them to get into a rhythm in the start of the fourthÂ  We had some costly turnovers as wellÂ  We let Steph shake three, but some of Steph's threes were some he made in the fourth quarter, were some of the same he missed in Game 2 or earlier in the game tonightÂ  We had some heck of a contest, but he was just â€‘â€‘ he let them go. But for us we've just got to continue to put the pressure on themÂ  Try to keep them below their averagesÂ  They're going to make great shotsÂ  They're a great team, great players, great coaching staffÂ  We'll just live with the results.",
        "7": "It's not satisfying when they end the game with 91Â  We hold them to 55 points for three quarters and we allowed them to break off with 36Â  That's not satisfying at allÂ  We've got a lot of film to watch tomorrowÂ  We're a young group, and we have to learn from our mistakesÂ  We had a lot of mistakes in the fourth quarterÂ  I think everybody's going to remember the turnovers we had lateÂ  But it started from the beginningÂ  We have to learn from those things. We're a young group, and like I told the guys, it's okayÂ  It's okayÂ  We haven't been in a lot of these situations, if any, with this group. But the best teacher in life is experienceÂ  We experienced it tonightÂ  We're going to watch a lot of film tomorrow on ways we can get better, close out games the best way, and we'll be ready for Game 4.",
        "8": "I think our relationship continues to grow every dayÂ  To have a guy like that who has been around the game of basketball for so many years, he wants the best out of his teamÂ  He wants the best for himself as well and his coaching staff and to be able to be the leader of the teamÂ  I just try to give it all back to him. My mind is always working throughout the gameÂ  Sometimes I'm able to say it verbally, sometimes I'm just thinking the game and hoping the coaching staff and players and the guys and Coach Blatt know whatever I'm doing, it's for the best of the teamÂ  And he's allowing me to do that, and I respect that a lot.",
        "9": "We just can't afford any more injuriesÂ  We just can't, especially from a guard perspectiveÂ  I just thought about his shoulderÂ  As soon as it happened, I knew exactly which shoulder it was, and I was just hoping for the bestÂ  When he came back on the floor with his shoulder wrapped and knowing that he wasn't at a hundred percent, which is his body out there, and still competing, it means everything to the teamÂ  It means everything to meÂ  It means everything to him as wellÂ  As you can tell, he came back out there. But, yeah, we just can't afford any injuries right nowÂ  We're already depleted.",
        "10": "A scarier opponent in our league?Ã‚Â  I mean, we have some very great basketball players in our league, and Steph happens to be one of themÂ  His ability to shoot the ball is probablyâ€‘â€‘ I've never seen someone that can shoot the ball off the dribble like himself, everÂ  So he's always keeping you off balanceÂ  Every game is differentÂ  He caught a rhythm in the fourth quarter tonight and hit some big shots. But for us we just try to continue to make it tough on himÂ  He's a great playerÂ  He's a league MVP, and that's all you can askÂ  Our defense, we held this great team to 40 percent shootingÂ  It's not just about one guyÂ  Even though he's going to get it going, we've just got to make sure we do a good number on the rest of those guys.",
        "11": "Well, the regular season can never compare to a playoff gameÂ  Just because we play so many games throughout the regular season, and you're going from city to city, players to players, different systems to different systemsÂ  You don't have much time to really get into the books and get into the tendencies and things of that nature. In the postseason you're able to kind of not get a rhythm, but know what's going to go onÂ  Because once the playoffs start, not many teams are going to changeÂ  You've worked so many months to work a system that that's what you're going to see. For us, for our coaching staff to be able to put us in a position where we feel like this is best for us to win, as the players, we just try to go out and execute it the best way we can by playing hard, competing, making them take tough shots and also attacking them on the other end. The playoffs is definitely a great way to just lock in on a certain team and not worrying about having to fly out and be in another city here or be in another city there or see another opponent the next night.

      "questions": {
        "0": "Your bench just got nine points in Game 1 and got 21 points todayÂ  What do you think about that?",
        "1": "LeBron, what is the next day and a half or so going to be like for you thinking about playing an NBA Finals game back in Cleveland?",
        "2": "What did you do after the shock of losing Game 1 and the news about Kyrie to get the team's spirits up heading into this game?",
        "3": "Have you ever played with a guy like Matthew Dellavedova before?Ã‚Â  And what was going through your mind when he was at the freeâ€‘throw line?",
        "4": "And about the free throws?",
        "5": "Your coach said that you guys were the underdog and you were written offÂ  You guys were written off coming into this gameÂ  How much is that a personal motivation for you and how important, how good does it feel to get a rareâ€‘â€‘ to get a lossâ€‘â€‘ to get a win in Golden State?",
        "6": "LeBron, just take us through Delly's performance on Steph CurryÂ  It's one of Steph's probably worst shooting performances in his career.",
        "7": "You've talked about different versions of this team this yearÂ  What is the identity of the team right now, and when did you discover that maybe it could be a grittier team than you had anticipated?",
        "8": "If you go back and look through just at all your games, all your performances, I don't think, especially in the playoffs, you've ever done what you've pulled off personally the last two gamesÂ  There are a number of different ways you can answer this, but where is it coming from?",
        "9": "You mentioned I believe yesterday, you said you could play 41, 42 minutesÂ  You played well over that tonight and still playedâ€‘â€‘ you were a force each and every minute on the court. Ã‚Â The next question everybody's going to ask is can this continue?Ã‚Â  Are you built for this?",
        "10": "Just piggybacking on that, two overtime games, 90â€‘something minutes for youÂ  How much are you feeling it right now?Ã‚Â  And did you come into tonight's game with a little bit different edge knowing you didn't have Kyrie to lean on a little?",
        "11": "Byron Scott used to talk about the injured dog theory; that an injured dog is the most frightening dogÂ  Do you guys feel like that's where you're at right now?",
        "12": "LeBron, I think you would prefer not to have to shoot 38 or 34 shots a gameÂ  What's it like for you to play this way and know that you do have to go out there and do this?",
        "13": "You obviously won four of these, but this is the first Finals win in Cavaliers historyÂ  You obviously are a man of historyÂ  What's this mean to you?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, our bench was big for us tonightÂ  We needed everything that we got from themÂ  They came in and did an excellent job of contributing offensively and defensivelyÂ  They were pretty good.",
        "1": "Well, it's going to be the same as it has been being out hereÂ  Roundâ€‘theâ€‘clock treatment, get my body, get my mind ready for the game. I get an opportunity to go homeÂ  I haven't seen my wife, seen my kids in four or five daysÂ  Give them some big hugs, big kisses, and then I'm going to lock back inÂ  So it's the same thing for me.",
        "2": "Just letting them understand and telling them about the moment, the moment that we're in, not about the gameÂ  I think the game is such a small thing, when you think about the moment and compare it to the momentÂ  We have a chance to be a part of history, but it's the small steps that you take to get to that point. So mentally, physically, just having those guys ready, throwing things in their ears to try to let them understand what this is all about, and they responded very well.",
        "3": "No, I think he's unique in his own wayÂ  Obviously he's a guy that's been counted out his whole lifeÂ  Probably people have been telling him he's too small, he's not fast enough, can't shoot it enough, can't handle it good enough, and he's beat the odds so many times. The confidence that we have in him allows him to be confident in himselfÂ  He goes out and he just plays his tail off, and when a guy like that does that, he gets great results.",
        "4": "Well, he was very calmÂ  Before you get to the free throws, just to follow up on the missed three by J.J., usually when J.J., J.R. and Mike Miller shoot, we don't rebound, because most of the time they make themÂ  So for us, for Delly to be able to crash in and get that and go up there and knock two free throws down, that was huge.",
        "5": "Well, I mean, I don't need any extra motivationÂ  I think our guys love itÂ  Our guys love the fact that we've been counted out and come into the series being an underdogÂ  They're pretty much saying that especially after Kyrie got hurt and the series was overÂ  I think our guys are using that as motivationÂ  I use a little bit of it, but I have a lot of motivation already to just be a part of greatness and be a part of this and be a part of this atmosphere. My motivation is to make sure my guys are ready and prepared every night we step on the floorÂ  And I have some other motivation that I won't talk about right now, but I have so many different things to worry about than being an underdog or guys counting us out.",
        "6": "It had everything to do with DellyÂ  He just kept a body on StephÂ  He made Steph workÂ  He was spectacular, man, defensivelyÂ  We needed everything from himÂ  When Steph shoots the ball, you just automatically think it's going in because he shoots the ball so wellÂ  I mean, he stunned me on one in the fourth quarter where he just took an inâ€‘andâ€‘out dribble and raised for a three and he nailed it and that wasn't on Delly. He just did a great jobÂ  Just trying to make it tough on StephÂ  That's all you can doÂ  You make it tough on himÂ  You get a contest, and you live with the results, and I think Delly did that.",
        "7": "Yeah, that's what it is, it's the grit squad that we haveÂ  It's not cute at allÂ  If you're looking for us to play sexy, cute basketball, then that's not usÂ  That's not us right nowÂ  Everything is toughÂ  You know, we're going to come in with an aggressive mindset defensively and offensively. And for us to win a Finals game shooting 32 percent from the field, it's just a testament of how gritty we can beÂ  It has to be that for the rest of the series, no matter how many games it takes.",
        "8": "(Laughing)Â  It just comes from the work ethicÂ  When the 20,000â€‘plus fans aren't there and you guys aren't there, I mean, you see it because you're probably with me every day and some of your other guys or some of our other beat writers, you guys see how much work I put into my craft every day, before, after practice. When you put that much work in there, you live with the resultsÂ  For me to be able to go out on the biggest stage and to be able to make plays happen for my teammates is the ultimate feeling for myselfÂ  That's why I take my profession, I take my craft very seriously.",
        "9": "Well, am I built for it?Ã‚Â  Well, of course I'm built for it (laughing)Â  I mean, it's a maximum of five games left in the NBA seasonÂ  So I'm ready for whatever.",
        "10": "Did you see how I walked in here?Ã‚Â  I'm feeling itÂ  I'm feeling it right now for sureÂ  That's why I've got one of the best trainers in the world in Mike Mancias who will make sure I'm ready for Game 3Â  We already have started on my rehabÂ  Already started on my sessionÂ  I will get rehab on the planeÂ  We've got a fiveâ€‘hour flight back home, and we've got allâ€‘aroundâ€‘theâ€‘clock treatment tomorrow and get ready for Game 3Â  I'll be ready.",
        "11": "I mean, all we can do is go out and play hardÂ  We're undermannedÂ  I mean, we're without two Allâ€‘Stars, and I don't know any other team in this league that would be able to do that, to be able to be without two Allâ€‘Stars on their team and compete the way we compete and be a forceÂ  So the guys are taking that very personal. For us mentally we can't allowâ€‘â€‘ the one thing we can't allow is what everyone is saying about us affect what we need to do out on the floor, because that's just smoke and mirrors of what everybody else says about us or what they think is going to happen with the seriesÂ  What truly matters is what we have as a game plan and how we go out and execute itÂ  That's all that matters.",
        "12": "Well, the good thing about tonight, I took 34 shots, but I had my 11 assistsÂ  Once again, I was knocking on the 40 door againÂ  So they let me score 40 againÂ  That felt prettyâ€‘â€‘ I'm happy I'm able to do that in a winÂ  So just to go outâ€‘â€‘ I'm not a highâ€‘volume shooterÂ  I've never been in my careerÂ  But things have changed on our team where the shots that Kevin and Kyrie would have has now been placed on myself and the rest of the guys as well. It's what needs to be done to help our team winÂ  Am I going to be in the 30s every game or things of that nature?Ã‚Â  I'm not sureÂ  I would not like toÂ  But if that's what the case has to be to help us win, then I don't have a choice.",
        "13": "It means everythingÂ  It means everything to be able to be a part of history and to get this win for this franchise, for our city, for all the Cavs fans all over the world. And if I can leave my fans with something, these fans here are pretty loud, pretty good, really goodÂ  I'm looking forward to seeing our fans and I can't wait to see our fansÂ  I've heard our fans pretty loud beforeÂ  A couple instances my first postseason appearance was really loud, and me coming home against the Knicks at the start of the season was pretty goodÂ  But I know we can be much, much louder than any fan base in this league. I know they're getting ready, and I can't wait to see them. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, I guess I'll ask you, when did you first find out about Kyrie's situation?Ã‚Â  I know you guys have been through this before with him being out, but is there a difference it being at this stage against a good opponent like this?",
        "1": "LeBron, as far as your Finals challenge with Kyrie's injury, is this as challenging as 2007 or most challenging thing you've had to try to overcome in your Finals experiences?",
        "2": "Do you feel like you've got to be more aggressive or more a facilitator with this injury?",
        "3": "How many minutes can you play in a 48â€‘minute game?",
        "4": "Yeah.",
        "5": "Coming into this series obviously people thought the Warriors were the favoriteÂ  Now, I don't think I've ever seen a team you're on being written off the way you areÂ  Is it motivating or is it annoying or are you just kind of down about the way the situation is, that this is going to be such a tough challenge?",
        "6": "J.R. was telling me that he used to play basketball with you in Akron in the summers early in his careerÂ  Can you tell me about that and how that came about and what your relationship was like from all the way back to those days?",
        "7": "Steph Curry is your opponent in these Finals and you're going after the same common goalÂ  Only one of you guys can win itÂ  But are there any ways you can relate to him being now the MVP, the face of the league, and all the pressures that goes along with that?",
        "8": "Why do you play so well here, and is there something about Oracle that you seem to like?",
        "9": "It came out that you and Steph Curry were born in the same hospital 39 months apartÂ  Got any reaction to that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I found out about it yesterday when everybody else found out about it on our squadÂ  It's a tough pill to swallowÂ  Obviously, we've been in this situation, but we always knew at some point he'll come backÂ  Knowing that he's out for the rest of The Finals and out for a period of a long time, first of all, it sucks for him personallyÂ  It's a huge blow for our team, especially at this stage. You want to try to be as close to full strength as possible throughout these games, especially when you're going against a worthy opponent like we're facingÂ  So it's a tough situation for our team, and guys have to pick up in his absence.",
        "1": "You know, I said it's going to be one of the most challenging seasons of my career from the beginning, and this just adds on to itÂ  You know, we're undermanned right nowÂ  But we've got guys in the locker room that are ready for the challenge, and we look forward to the challenge tomorrow night.",
        "2": "Well, if I get more aggressive than 36 shots (laughing), I might have about 58 of them things tomorrow nightÂ  I don't know how much more aggressive you want me to get at this point.",
        "3": "At a Finals?",
        "4": "40, 41, 42Â  In regular season pace, I can give you all 48Â  I play extremely hard throughout the postseason, and I'd be cheating my team if I said I could go out and play 48 minutesÂ  I think that's impossible.",
        "5": "Well, first of all, I don't really know what the noise is outsideÂ  I haven't heard about anything, obviously, besides just Kyrie being outÂ  That is the only thing I've heardÂ  Understand that we was the underdog coming into the series, and with Kyrie being out people are writing us offÂ  So, I mean, that's fineÂ  That's fineÂ  I'm motivated to get our guys ready to go tomorrow, and we will be ready.",
        "6": "Well, I saw a gifted kidÂ  I've always had an openâ€‘gym policy for young guys that are trying to get betterÂ  He was one of those guysÂ  Just seeing the talent that he had at such a young age, you know, we've had our friendship and that's gone a long way before, obviously, getting to this point in The FinalsÂ  Now we're teammates. He's had a heck of a career to this pointÂ  He's been misunderstood throughout his careerÂ  But this year he showcased and showed who he is and who he truly wants to be known as in this league, and that's a great teammate, a knockdown shooter, a guy who competes and plays to winÂ  It's been great to have him as part of this team.",
        "7": "I don't think there's much pressure on him at allÂ  I think he's had an unbelievable seasonÂ  Got the MVP, rightfully soÂ  Led his team all year longÂ  I don't think it's much pressure on him, thoughÂ  You know, for him to just go out there and play his game, he has a great supporting castÂ  He has a great team. But I think he just goes out and playsÂ  I don't think anybody has put too much pressure on him to do anything besides what he's been doing all year.",
        "8": "I don't know, manÂ  First of all, I loveâ€‘â€‘ I always said I love the road much more than I love homeÂ  I don't knowÂ  I get excited to be on the road and trying to take the crowd out of it and make big shots with the crowd going crazy and things of that nature. It's a great fan base hereÂ  They know the game of basketballÂ  They know so much history of the gameÂ  They've had so many greats come in here either from opponents or their respective teamÂ  I just try to be remembered when I'm in this building at the end of the day.",
        "9": "I think it's pretty coolÂ  You know, it's the true definition of It's a small world for sure, being in this situation today and knowing that we were born in the same hospital, not too far apartÂ  So it's pretty cool for our city, for the city that I stand for every single day when I wake upÂ  To know a great guy like that was born in the same city, it means a lot to us.

      "questions": {
        "0": "You got 16 shots in the paint, 22 shots outside the paintÂ  You hit 11 in the paint, 7 outsideÂ  Do you need to get more shots in the Lane, and what can you do to do that?",
        "1": "This team is back in a situation where you don't know Kyrie's status againÂ  How confident are you that somebody else, one or two of your teammates, will be able to do what they did in previous rounds?",
        "2": "Just talking to J.R., and he was talking about your last shot in regulation and you're kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't and people used to criticize you for not taking that shot, now you take it in rhythm and people are criticizing you for that as wellÂ  What did you think of the look?Ã‚Â  Does that matter to you what peopleâ€‘â€‘ how they analyze your shot selection?",
        "3": "Two questionsÂ  The Warriors have talked about Harrison Barnes, Iguodala talked about they're okay with you getting your points as long as everybody else is not getting theirsÂ  How do you combat that?Ã‚Â  Number two, why the early workout?",
        "4": "Going back to that last shot in regulation, when you're going through the decision whether to drive or take the shot like that, at the end of the game when you go into the lane and there is congestion, do you sometimes look more for the jumpshot because you know you can get that look clean?Ã‚Â  Whereas if you go into the lane, it seems like other things can happen, obviouslyÂ  That way you can ensure to get the shot off if you're taking the jumper?",
        "5": "LeBron, I know injury is part of the game, but for you personally you've gotten to The Finals a few times, going back to your first time in Cleveland when one of your most important players was below 100 percent and couldn't be himselfÂ  Do you get discouraged that this keeps sort of happening at this time of the year?",
        "6": "You've been in this situation not only, of course, in these playoffs losing Game 1, but throughout your career losing Game 1 of The FinalsÂ  Can you take us through just sort of I guess the mindset when you lose a Game 1 and what you have to fight through to get ready for Game 2?",
        "7": "It looks like, sort of following up on that, that they'll let you have 40 and you would prefer to pass, how do you deal with that?Ã‚Â  Also, do you think Shumpert's shot was in at the buzzer?",
        "8": "CorrectÂ  Correct.",
        "9": "LeBron, Draymond remembers when he was a rookie the first time I think he faced you when you were with the Heat in 2012Â  There was a play in the post that you kind of abused him and you said, You're too smallÂ  He said that motivated him to this day; he still thinks about itÂ  Do you remember the moment, and what do you think of the way he's evolved since that moment in his rookie year?",
        "10": "What is your point of view on the Warriors' defense and how they're approaching you?Ã‚Â  And when you survey the court, what are you seeing?",
        "11": "I know that you like to not take as much shots and distribute to your teamÂ  You just said thatÂ  How are you going to get that done?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I'm going to continue to mix it upÂ  Whatever the defense or the game presents itself, I'll be ready to adjustÂ  I'll play both inside and outside, and I like to keep the defense off balance.",
        "1": "The good thing about it, we've been in this position beforeÂ  If he's not able to goâ€‘â€‘ we're not quite sure right nowÂ  But if he's not able to go, it's something that's not new to usÂ  So next man up, and guys will be ready for the challenge.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, when you take a shot and you miss you have so many different thoughts in your mind saying okay, I should have done this or I should have done thatÂ  When you take a shot and you make it, there is really nothing else to think aboutÂ  But for me I got to a spot where I'm comfortable making the shotÂ  Stepback going left, that's a shot that I'm very capable of making obviously in rhythm, which I wasÂ  It just didn't go down for me. I really don't hear the criticism and things of that nature because I don't read anythingÂ  I don't see anythingÂ  I don't watch anythingÂ  So that stuff reallyâ€‘â€‘ it never gets to me really, so it doesn't bother me at all.",
        "3": "Well, we still had a chance to winÂ  When guysâ€‘â€‘ myself, Kyrie, Mozzyâ€‘â€‘ you know, we did a good job of putting points on the board, and every addition that we had was big for usÂ  We've got to do a better job, obviously, of getting guys involvedÂ  But at the same time, we put ourselves in position to winÂ  The answer to that question is it's not earlyÂ  It's not early at all.",
        "4": "I don't predetermine what I'm going to doÂ  I can get to a spot where I'm very comfortable with or I driveÂ  I've made game winners on jumpersÂ  I've made game winners on layâ€‘upsÂ  So I don't really predetermine what I'm going to doÂ  Just the shot that I was very comfortable with going left presented a stepback for me, and that's just going against â€‘â€‘ or going with the things that I work on and things that I'm confident with making. It's not like I'm predetermined when I'm coming out of the huddle saying, okay, I'm going to driveÂ  I'm going to drive or I'm going to shootÂ  It's just the rhythm I'm in.",
        "5": "Well, there are a few things that you would love to have going late in the seasonÂ  That's being healthy, having a great rhythm, and then you need a little luck as well. We've had a great rhythmÂ  We haven't had much luck, and we haven't been healthyÂ  But I haven't gotten discouragedÂ  I understand the moment that I'm in, and I'm not too much worried about the gameÂ  I'm worried about the momentÂ  I'm happy with the momentÂ  I'm excited to be in this moment once again, and I'm going to stay strong for my team, no matter who is or is not in the lineup.",
        "6": "It's not a great feeling, for sureÂ  I didn't get much sleep last nightÂ  You just playâ€‘â€‘ your mind just plays with you so much throughout the course of the nightÂ  Different plays, different scenarios, different points of the game where you could have made a play here, could have made a play there to help your team win. So the mind never lets you at easeÂ  So it's always a tough 24 or 48 or whatever case, how many hours it isÂ  But at some point you get to the film room, which I've already started, and you start to prepare yourself mentally on what needs to be done going into Game 2.",
        "7": "Well, first of all, you can't let me have 40.",
        "8": "Yeah, yeahÂ  You don't let me have 40Â  I go get 40Â  It's not like they're just getting out of the wayÂ  So those guys aren't saying we're okay with letting him have 40Â  You don't let me have 40; I'm making those shots. From my angle, it did look like it had a great chance of going in, and it just didn't fall.",
        "9": "Well, if you knew Draymond, he started the trash talking first in that gameÂ  I'm not much of a trash talker, but he started it first his rookie yearÂ  So don't let him try to start up a story on why he's motivated because I said somethingÂ  He started it, and I finished it (smiling).",
        "10": "Well, they had differentâ€‘â€‘ they mixed it up last nightÂ  Sometimes they didn't dig in the postÂ  Sometimes they let me play oneâ€‘onâ€‘oneÂ  Sometimes Bogut was over on the tilt and brought two defendersÂ  They switched sometimes on pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  Sometimes they went under. So they were giving me everythingÂ  They're not just giving me one steady dosage of we're going to just let him playÂ  NoÂ  That's what they want to get out to you guys, but that's not what's happeningÂ  Yeah, I see it all throughout the course of the gameÂ  They've given me different matchâ€‘ups, just trying to keep me off balance. But I've seen it all, and I've got to do a better job as well getting my other guys involvedÂ  I'm okay with getting big numbers and things of that nature, but I feel much better when I'm able to get my guys in rhythm and get them guys some more looks. So I think one of the things is trying to stay at home on a lot of my shootersÂ  They didn't give James Jones as much air spaceÂ  J.R. got a couple good looks, it just didn't go downÂ  He had one where Kyrie kind of fell, pitched it to him, he had a threeÂ  He had one in the corner in overtime that kind of went off the side of the backboardÂ  But he's capable of making that shotÂ  We've got to get those guys involved as well.",
        "11": "I'm going to just go play the gameÂ  Just go play the game and see where it takes youÂ  It's notâ€‘â€‘ sometimes it's notâ€‘â€‘ it's not rocket scienceÂ  You just go out and see what the challenges of the game presents itself. At the end of the day I've been playing basketball for a long time and I've seen it allÂ  No matter what the circumstances are, you go out and play as hard as you can and you live with the results.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, I wanted to ask you about your mindset on the final possession in regulation?Ã‚Â  You obviously made jumpers throughout the game, but you had great success getting in the paintÂ  I was just wondering if you were anticipating a double coming, and you might have to give up the ball and not be able to take the last shot yourself?Ã‚Â  Is that why you shot a jumper?",
        "1": "In the overtime, what happened in the overtime?Ã‚Â  You got just two points?",
        "2": "Last time you guys lost in the playoffs was in Chicago Game 3, reeled off seven wins since thenÂ  Do you think you guys learned anything from that experience, and can you lean on it in this situation?",
        "3": "Up until that final minute, Kyrie had had such a good gameÂ  How tough was it to see him go down, and how concerned are you about him?",
        "4": "Adding to that, LeBron, if Kyrie is limited at all and he can't do what you need him to do, the bench numbers were so lopsided, do you have enough you can find without him?",
        "5": "Coach Blatt said that you had a great performance, obviously, 44 pointsÂ  But the guys around you are going to need to be betterÂ  Your thoughts on how your teammate played tonight?",

        "7": "Were your guys getting tired?",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, my mindset was we're either going to go out of here with a win or going into overtimeÂ  I'm going to get the last shotÂ  Actually, Shumpert was able to get another look at it, but I got to where I wanted to get, step back, made them beforeÂ  We had our chances.",
        "1": "I mean, you just said itÂ  We couldn't get a good lookÂ  We couldn't get nothing to drop, including myselfÂ  J.R. had a really good look on the three at one point, but they just ramped it up a little bitÂ  They got to the freeâ€‘throw line, and we didn't get itÂ  I mean, we really only had zero points, and I got the layâ€‘up at the end, but that didn't mean much because they did a good job closing it in overtime.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, we had a lot of miscues tonightÂ  I think they would say the sameÂ  We had a lot of breakdowns, a couple of transition threes they made that we kind of pinpointed on saying we don't want to give those upÂ  But at the end of the day, we gave ourselves a chance, manÂ  I missed a tough oneÂ  But we had so many opportunities to win this game, and we didn'tÂ  It's up to us now to look at the film, watch and make some adjustments, what you need to do and be ready for Sunday.",
        "3": "It was very tough to seeÂ  I just see how hard he worked these last eight days just to get himself to play at this level tonightÂ  Seeing him walk out of the locker room on crutches just now, that's a tough blow for our team.",
        "4": "Well, I mean, it's the next man upÂ  If Kyrie can't go, Delly's number is going to be called and everyone else has to pick each other upÂ  They outscored us 35â€‘9 on bench pointsÂ  But, you know, we still had a chance to winÂ  We had a few miscues defensivelyÂ  Had a couple of turnovers offensively, but we were right thereÂ  Like I said, they just made a couple more plays than we made.",
        "5": "We all have to be better, including myselfÂ  I don't think I was greatÂ  I've got to do better things out on the floor to help us be more precise offensivelyÂ  I've got to communicate a little bit more defensively to help our team get over the hump. It's not about meÂ  It's not about the next guyÂ  It's about all of usÂ  We have toâ€‘â€‘ we're going to watch the film and get better for Game 2.",
        "6": "What do you mean?",
        "7": "I mean, I think everyone was out there just playing through it, just trying to fight through itÂ  Both teams have been off for so many days that fatigue may have set inÂ  But both teams were fighting and both teams wanted to win really bad.",
        "8": "Well, they expect for me to make playsÂ  It's nothing I did tonightÂ  It's nothing different than what I've been doing all postseasonÂ  That's just been our game planÂ  Guys have been able to step up and make shots and make playsÂ  So it has nothing to do about beast mode or whatever the caseÂ  It's our game plan, and our game plan workedÂ  We put ourselves in a position to win, we just didn't come through."

      "questions": {
        "0": "When you got to Cleveland and you came back to Cleveland you asked people to be patient, and now you're here on the cusp of another championship, are you feeling the pressure to deliver?Ã‚Â  What do you think the Cleveland people expect from you at this point?",
        "1": "When you came back to Cleveland, I think many people were quite moved of the heartfelt nature of itÂ  When you talked it came from your heart, wanting to win a championship for the city and bringing a championship to the cityÂ  What's it mean to you to have this goal to bring the championship to Cleveland?",
        "2": "How much has it grown outside the court for you?Ã‚Â  Can you even be yourself?Ã‚Â  What are the pressures like and things you've got to take care of?Ã‚Â  I'm sure you can't get a meal, can't walk anywhereÂ  How do you manage all that and how big everything has become?",
        "3": "How are you feeling with the pressures that come with you?",
        "4": "I was going to say my sister said she saw you at BurgerFi the other dayÂ  You've talked all playoffs about how much you love playing on the roadÂ  And as you know, of course, the Warriors are really good hereÂ  Does it take something extra to win a game in The Finals like this against a team that good at home?",
        "5": "When you look back at your first trip to the Finals in Cleveland and then the first one you won in Miami when you had Dwyane Wade who had won a championship, Warriors have zero experience in The Finals, you're going into your fifthÂ  How much do you think experience plays a factor on this big stage?",
        "6": "You've had, as you know, two buzzer beaters almost the identical spot on the floor hereÂ  Does that mean anything to you?Ã‚Â  When you step into this building, do you call upon those vibes?",
        "7": "LeBron, your six Finals, I assume you've gotten here relatively healthy other than wear and tear of a long seasonÂ  Can you appreciate what Kyrie is facing right now being here for the first time not being a hundred percent healthy?Ã‚Â  What can you say to him or what will you say to him?",
        "8": "As a student of the game, you've seen some great ball handlers during your timeÂ  We've got two incredible ones in this seriesÂ  Can you kind of talk about what they both do so well when they handle the ball, and kind of compare and contrast Kyrie and Steph Curry?",
        "9": "LeBron, what's it like for you to be back here in Oakland?Ã‚Â  I know you had some ties to Oakland as a youthÂ  What would you like to say to folks here in Oakland?",
        "10": "I saw you said the other day that you thought you were playing better now than at any other pointÂ  Is that because of sort of intellectually the way you see the game?Ã‚Â  What goes into your feeling that way?",
        "11": "There's a lot of excitement at home because of the Australian involvement in this gameÂ  What difference do we bring to the game, do you think, as players?Ã‚Â  And also a lot has been said about Delly being dirtyÂ  Are we tough players?Ã‚Â  Is that what we're all about?",
        "12": "Not on your nelly."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "All I can guarantee is that we're going to play hardÂ  We're going to give everything that we've got in these two gamesÂ  Coaches will give us the proper game plan to go out and execute, and it's up to the players to go out and do it. For me as leader of the team, it's my job to lead the guys and to perform wellÂ  At the end of the day, win, lose or draw, that's all I can ask out of myself and ask out of my guys, and we'll do that.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, it's part of my motivationÂ  I understand the drought our city has been in as far as a major championship, so it's a huge motivation inside of meÂ  And it's helped me get to this point, but I'm not doneÂ  I've still got a lot left in me in this season, and I'm going to command a lot out of my guysÂ  I'm going to command a lot out of myself, and hopefully we're able to come through.",
        "2": "Well, I'm able to pick and chooseÂ  I do normal stuff, I guessÂ  I went to the movies last week at a regular movie theaterÂ  I went to go seeâ€‘â€‘ I forgot the name of the movieÂ  But I went to go seeâ€‘â€‘ what is the movie with the girls and they're singing?Ã‚Â  Pitch Perfect 2, which is unbelievableÂ  Fat Amy is awesomeÂ  I love herÂ  Wherever you are, you're awesome. I sat out at an outdoor burger place and had a burgerÂ  Last night I went out and had a great dinnerÂ  I do normal stuffÂ  I think I do.",
        "3": "I've been in front of this since I was a 15â€‘yearâ€‘old kidÂ  Obviously it wasn't broadcast in as many countries as it is now 15 years later, but I've been dealing with this since I was 15 years oldÂ  Getting questioned by you guys, obviously not you guys, but my local city newspaper or when I was traveling playing basketballÂ  So it's something I've been dealing with for half of my lifeÂ  So I think I've done a pretty cool job.",
        "4": "You don't put too much more pressure on itÂ  It's a court and it's basketball, and it's ten guys on the court, it's three referees, and it's 20,000â€‘plus fansÂ  It doesn't changeÂ  These fans here are amazingÂ  They've been amazing all year and for the last past few years. But for me, I don't put too much pressure on itÂ  I've heardâ€‘â€‘ I've been in so many loud arenasÂ  This is going to be one of themÂ  I've played in OKC in The Finals to start off the seriesÂ  I've played in BostonÂ  I've played in Detroit when they were in their heydayÂ  I've played in Chicago in 2011 to open up the Eastern Conference FinalsÂ  I've played in San AntonioÂ  So I've been in some very loud buildings, and this, obviously, I know tomorrow is going to be one of them. But I don't add too much pressure on itÂ  You just go out and you just try to playÂ  You've got to commandÂ  Sometimes you've got to have some hand signals depending on how loud they getÂ  But for the most part, you just trust what you've been able to do.",
        "5": "I don't knowÂ  I mean, it's just basketballÂ  I don't like to put too much experience into itÂ  Those guys have been playing championship basketball all yearÂ  So why would they change?Ã‚Â  We've been playing championship basketball over the last two and a half months, so we're not going to change either, just go out and play. Actually going to my sixth FinalsÂ  That's five in a rowÂ  But who's counting (laughing).",
        "6": "Well, if I get that opportunity again, I'm going to be very confident in my ability, and I know the fans will probably remember me hitting two buzzer beatersÂ  So if we're fortunate enough and it's a close game and we have the ball, I definitely would like the ball in my handsÂ  Not saying I'm going to shoot itÂ  I'm going to make the right play to help our team winÂ  But if I get a good look at it, I believe it will go down.",
        "7": "I can appreciate him just fighting through itÂ  I know he sat out two games in the Atlanta series, but he's been fighting through it since the second game of the Boston seriesÂ  It's difficult on him for sureÂ  We want the bestÂ  Whatever he can give us, it's going to be great for our teamÂ  Kyrie at 50, Kyrie at 60, Kyrie at 70 is better than Kyrie at zero. His presence on the floorÂ  When that No. 2 Irving steps onto the court, he's a presenceÂ  And the defense has to be aware of him, has to account for him just because of his abilities to make playsÂ  But you definitely can appreciate it. Any guy that is playing through injuries, I mean, we all are at this point, but he's dealing with something that's even more challenging, so you definitely commend him.",
        "8": "Yeah, they are two of the best ball handlers that this league has ever seenÂ  Their ability to make shots off the handle, Steph's ability to use his handle to get off shots, three step backsÂ  Kyrie's ability to be crafty, use his ability to get into the lane and make shotsÂ  When you have a handle like that, you can pretty much get any shot you want, and they both show you thatÂ  With their speed, their change of pace, their ball handling, and then their ability to shoot the ballÂ  They can absolutely just shoot the rock. When you have a handle like that, it just keeps the defender, keeps the second line of defense, third line of defense so off kilter because you don't quite know exactly where they're going to be.",
        "9": "I don't knowÂ  I have a couple guys hereÂ  I spent some time when I was a youth and playing some AAU ball hereÂ  It's always good to see some friends that you spent time with when you were youngerÂ  I know you're rooting for the Warriors, and that's coolÂ  But, you know, hopefully you were cheering for us throughout the Eastern Conference.",
        "10": "If I was to say just my game, I wouldn't think soÂ  I haven't shot the ball wellÂ  I've had some highâ€‘turnover games in the postseasonÂ  So as far as just going out on the floor, I wouldn't say this is the best I've played in a stretch runÂ  I would think '09 I had a pretty good run when we lost to Orlando in the Eastern Conference FinalsÂ  I believe I averaged like 37, like 50â€‘something percent shooting in that roundÂ  High rebounds, high assists, and I felt really goodÂ  Just couldn't get our guys over the hump. But I think now when you put my whole body of work, as far as how I approach the game mentally as well as my game, I'm very, very confident in my ability to be able to see the game even before the game is played.",
        "11": "Can you play ball?",
        "12": "Oh, man, I was going to ask Coach to pick you upÂ  We need another Australian on our teamÂ  I love our Australian that we haveÂ  I love DellyÂ  What he brings to our team brings just toughness and grit, determinationÂ  Just tries to beat all the oddsÂ  He's been great for us, and I know he's happy to be back here too, playing college ball hereÂ  I know he's excited being back, and should be very funÂ  But, yeah, I love you Australian guysÂ  You guys are cool.

      "questions": {
        "0": "Your teammates have been talking lately that this may be the best basketball you've played in the postseason, just from what they've watched as a fan to now being your teammateÂ  Where do you weigh in on that?",
        "1": "Do you feel like you're playing that way?",
        "2": "You like to keep things lighthearted and keep things loose, but in the playoffs it seems like you're really focused and in tuneÂ  Is that something you feel like you have to have that type of zonedâ€‘in mindset going?",
        "3": "Are were you able to figure out anything technical with your threeâ€‘point shot?",
        "4": "Your game has been scrutinized since you were in high schoolÂ  Because of that experience, does that give you some empathy for what Coach Blatt experienced this year?",
        "5": "Does he maybe deserve more credit than he's gotten?",
        "6": "You're shooting almost 50% inside the arc in the playoffsÂ  Do you have to keep taking the three or they'll just zone you up or what?",
        "7": "Short sometimes more than anything?",
        "8": "Over the course of your career most teams only have one guy that can realistically try to stop you and try to guard youÂ  How do things change and does your approach change at all when guys throw multiple people at you that aren't matching you subâ€‘forâ€‘sub and then kind of rotate?",
        "9": "Do you feel like when teams have done thatâ€‘â€‘ I can't think of too many opponents that have tried to do thatâ€‘â€‘ but do you feel like it's an attempt to try to fatigue you a little bit by throwing multiple bodies at you?",
        "10": "Do you feel like the league is shifting in that direction, in part, to try to figure out how to guard you and players of your strength and size?",
        "11": "If you could go back to July with your letter and then August with the reception at AkronÂ  What was your perception of how the fans reacted to you coming back?Ã‚Â  Was there anyway that you shared feelings with those fans, like you had the same feelings?",
        "12": "What do you think about Wade down in Miami and how that may change things?",
        "13": "Wade is talking about opting out down in Miami because they don't want to match whatever the contract was?",
        "14": "That's what people are saying.",
        "15": "That's what the reports are saying?",
        "16": "The first time you saw Steph, I think in person, maybe you had seen him before, it was at Ford Field and you were pronounced in your belief that he would be a good player in the leagueÂ  A lot of people thought he was too frailÂ  What did you see even then?",
        "17": "How is this team different from the team that went to the Finals in '07?",
        "18": "The regular season matchâ€‘up with the Warriors you went for 40â€‘plus, and you hold Steph Curry to 15 (No Microphone)Â  After you got that win, did you think of how significant that would be if you meet them later on?",
        "19": "Along the lines of what you were asked earlier, when you combine where you're at physically and mentally, and all the experience you've gained, are you at the best you've ever been right now?",
        "20": "Can I ask you about Mozgov's game since you've become teammates, and what was your impression of him before?",
        "21": "When you went to Miami, how much attention did you pay to these guys with a 26â€‘game losing streak and all that was doing wrong?Ã‚Â  I know you had your own issues to worry about in Miami, but you're also a student of the game?",
        "22": "How different is Golden State in terms of, I guess Atlanta is a good preparation for it, but in terms of recognition and helping and realizing who is left out there on the perimeter and who you can really leave?",
        "23": "Are you happy with the preparation this week and where you guys are at right now?",
        "24": "Can you describe the mood of the team?",
        "25": "You're not supposed to read it.",
        "26": "How much has the layoff helped Kyrie?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't knowÂ  They see me every day, and I happen to be alongside those guys, and I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to help our team winÂ  It's great to know your teammates appreciate what you do, and I'm just trying to give it all back to them the best way I can.",
        "1": "I don't knowÂ  I've had some great playoff runs beforeÂ  I don't know if this is the top right nowÂ  We'll see in less than a month.",
        "2": "It's a switch that I have during the postseasonÂ  The regular season is so long, being intense and stoneâ€‘faced during the regular season, it's too longÂ  There are too many games, too many road trips, and it can make the game very staleÂ  But during the postseason I understand it's a different season, and it's a different approachÂ  This is how I approach it.",
        "3": "No, I just haven't been in a good rhythm and shooting the ballÂ  But it hasn't stopped me from doing what I need to do as far as helping our teamÂ  The threeâ€‘point shot is something that if I was a player that needed that shot to be effective, then it would affect my game, but it doesn't. I mean, if I make a few, I'll take themÂ  But if I don't, I'll stop taking themÂ  I'm able to do other things and still be effective.",
        "4": "Well, any time someone is scrutinized really for nothing, I'm able to relateÂ  For him in his instance, obviously, we knew there were a lot of people that were going to say things that didn't mean much, but that's just what they have to doÂ  That's what helps sales. People love reading the negative things more than the positive things, and I think he's handled the situation unbelievably being a rookie coach in the NBA and being able to take this team to the Finals, I think he's done a hell of a job.",
        "5": "I don't think he cares about thatÂ  It shouldn't matterÂ  Getting credit from other people?Ã‚Â  Who caresÂ  It's all about how we credit each other that's on these floors every day in this practice facility, game, film sessions, things of that nature, so it shouldn't matter what everybody else says.",
        "6": "No, you know, you keep your defense off guardÂ  That's what I want to doÂ  If I haveâ€‘â€‘ it's not like I'm taking crazy threeâ€‘point shotsÂ  If the shot is there, I'm taking it and shooting it with confidence.",
        "7": "Oh, they've been shortÂ  They've been long, they've been left, and they've been rightÂ  They haven't been inÂ  But I've gotten some great work in this week, so we'll see what happens.",
        "8": "It doesn't changeÂ  Still got the same uniform onÂ  It don't change at allÂ  My approach doesn't change no matter who is guarding me.",
        "9": "No, I think it's a luxury that can have multiple bodies that can defend any offensive playerÂ  In Golden State's case, they have multiple bodies they've shown this year and in the past, even when I was playing in Miami, to able to go to Iguodala, Harrison Barnes, Draymond, Klay, to have multiple bodies that they would put on meÂ  But it doesn't affect what I need to do.",
        "10": "If they are, the league ain't doing a good job of it (laughing).",
        "11": "I think the letter speaks for itself or spoke for itself at the timeÂ  I understood what I mean to this community, what I meant to this State with northeast Ohio and the fans here and the people hereÂ  I just want to try to give it all back to them the best way I can, both on the floor and off the floor as a role model, as a basketball player, as a father, whatever the case may beÂ  I think they recognize my passion, not only on the floor but off the floor, and I recognize their passion as wellÂ  So it's mutual.",
        "12": "What happened?",
        "13": "He said that?",
        "14": "Did he say that?",
        "15": "I'm not commenting on itÂ  If Dwyane Wade didn't say I'm opting out, then I'm not commenting on that.",
        "16": "I saw a kid who didn't care how big someone was, how fast someone else was, how strong someone else wasÂ  He just went out and playedÂ  He wasn't going to let anything, as far as the analytics when it comes to sides, power, strength, speed, stop him from what he was able to doÂ  It was great to see someone like that who doesn't get caught up in people going after guys who can jump higher and run faster and run through a wall harder and things like that. He was just out there playing free and loving the gameÂ  He had a bunch of guys on this team, I don't know if I can name one of them right nowÂ  I don't think you guys could either (No Audio)Â  And that's something that I definitely caught on to.",
        "17": "That's so long agoÂ  You know, we were much younger as far as experienceÂ  We have a more experienced teamÂ  This is a much older group of guysÂ  I think this team is probably a little bit more athletic, and probably a little more fire power offensivelyÂ  What kept us in the game in '07 was how well we defended. We defended very, very well, but we always got at some point throughout the game just half scoring lulls where we couldn't score the ballÂ  Now we definitely have more offensive power here.",
        "18": "NoÂ  There are a few teams in the West that I thought if we could take care of our business here, that we could match up with themÂ  They were one of them, along with San Antonio and the Clippers. So when we went against those guys here, and I wasn't playing at Golden State, obviously thoughts come to your mind if you face them in June how great it would be to compete against them.",
        "19": "I think if you put it all together, yeahÂ  If you put everything togetherÂ  As far as my mind, my body, my game, you put everything in one bottle, it's probably the best I've been.",
        "20": "Not much impression of him beforeÂ  He was too in and out of the lineup in Denver, so you didn't really get a full glimpse of himÂ  In New York his stint was shortÂ  When he got here, the first thing I recognized was how mobile and agile he was from baseline to baselineÂ  That is the one thing that impressed me from the beginning.",
        "21": "I paid attention to itÂ  I saw what was going onÂ  You know, you're just hoping at some point they'd be able to win some ballgames. But at the same time, what I was going through my first year in Miami, I couldn't really pay too much attention to anything elseÂ  Just trying to get through the mud that I was trying to get to and figure out a way to be productive.",
        "22": "Well, you can't really leave anyoneÂ  Coach Kerr does a great job of putting guys on the floor that can make plays no matter who it isÂ  You can't really leave anyoneÂ  They're highâ€‘motor guys, and you can't relax for one second defensively or they'll make you payÂ  It's almost like playing San Antonio. San Antonio can shoot the ball as great as those guys did, even though Danny Green and Patty Mills, and even Kawhi got it going at timesÂ  But their motor and it starts with the point guard, Tony Parker and Steph Curry, their motor, getting the ball into early offense and getting those guys moving is something you can't coach and something you have to be aware of defensively at all times.",
        "23": "Yeah, absolutelyÂ  We've still got three days leftÂ  Two and a half tomorrow, Wednesday, and probably Thursday, and we'll be ready to go.",
        "24": "RestlessÂ  Yeah, we're restlessÂ  We're ready to goÂ  But we're not going to discredit these next few daysÂ  We still have to get in the lab and go over our preparation and still prepÂ  But we're restlessÂ  We don't like this much time offÂ  I don't think anyone, the fans, you guys, I don't think you like this much time offÂ  You're all writing the same things every day now.",
        "25": "I'm not readingÂ  I'm just guessingÂ  I'm just guessing.",
        "26": "Well, I mean, every day helpsÂ  Whatever we can get out of himÂ  I think he's going to play Game 1, whatever we can get out of him is a plus for usÂ  He's been dealing with injuries throughout the whole postseason. He's been working, getting some good work in, off to the side at timesÂ  He's played a little bit with us, but not muchÂ  So whatever we can get from Kyrie is a plus.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, when you came back, you said you had a plan, you had a missionÂ  Obviously, that's almost accomplished, but can you just talk to me about your emotions and what it's like to actually be in this position right now afterâ€‘â€‘ you know, even before you came here, you knew you had something going.",
        "1": "LeBron, you yourself, I think, had said last summer that you kind of tried to lower expectations and you couldn't expect a ton in year one, and obviously there were a lot of changes, tooÂ  This was basically a brand new team on opening nightÂ  Did you think you could do this this quickly?Ã‚Â  And where does this accomplishment rank amongâ€‘â€‘ I mean, it's five straight Finals, obviously, but where does this one rank in relation to the rest?",

        "4": "LeBron, how did the journey of the season prep you to get here?Ã‚Â  As you mentioned, if you guys didn't lose games early, maybe you don't make radical tradesÂ  If you guys don't have injuries throughout the course of the season, maybe you don't realize the potential of all the guys on your rosterÂ  What about the path to where you are?Ã‚Â  How has that steeled you for these Finals?",

        "12": "LeBron, from now until when The Finals start, the championship drought, it's going to come up again and againÂ  It's such a weighty issue here in Cleveland, of course, 50 yearsÂ  When you wrote the letter, of course, you kind of tried to connect back to the people here, and your Nike commercial connected you to everybodyÂ  Now that you're here, do you embrace kind of that 50â€‘year drought?Ã‚Â  Do you use that to fuel what you guys all need to do or do you have to separate yourself from that pressure to be able to win?"

        "0": "My emotions, it's very emotional to be back in this cityÂ  When I made my decision to come back here, I knew what I wanted to do, but I knew it wasn't going to be easyÂ  It's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication, and it's going to be the toughest task for me to try to get this team back to The Finals. I've had to step up my leadershipÂ  I had to be very patient, which I'm not very patientÂ  I'm not a very patient guy, but I knew I had to work on that. To be able to sit at one point during the season and see us at 19â€‘20 and watching my team struggle and me sitting out two weeks, they wanted Coach Blatt fired, saying we needed another point guard, will LeBron and Kyrie be able to play together?Ã‚Â  So many story lines was just happening at that point in timeÂ  For us to be sitting at this point today being able to represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals, this is specialÂ  It's very special.",
        "1": "Obviously, from the time I decided to come back to now, it's a totally different teamÂ  When I decided to come back, we had a No.1 pick, and we drafted Andrew WigginsÂ  I understood that we were going to have a very, very young team, a very unexperienced team, and it's going to take a lot of patience and a lot of hard work to get to where I wanted to get this team back to. Obviously, things happened throughout the season, throughout the offâ€‘season, that allowed us to acquire Kevin Love, and as the season started, to acquire J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov and Iman Shumpert that brought our team to a place where I felt that we could compete. But I still thought we had to be very patient, I had to be very patient, being the leader of the team, but I knew we had the pieces that we can compete. Where this ranks as far as my last four Finals appearances, I mean, it's special just because I think it's today, it's tonight, and to know how far we've come as a group, to know how unexperienced we are as a unit playing together, I think that's special in its own rightÂ  No matter what happens from here on out, to see what we've accomplished being a firstâ€‘year team together that's had different changes throughout the course of the season, that's faced so many obstacles throughout the seasonâ€‘â€‘ injuries here, transactions here, lineups hereâ€‘â€‘ it's something we can be very proud of to this point.",
        "2": "I'm a guy who believes in unfinished business, and I understood what these people were going through, the people here not only in Cleveland but in Northeast Ohio and all over the world who love and bleed wine and gold. I also knew there were a couple of guys here that were very special, in Tristan Thompson here to my left and also in Kyrie Irving at the time, that could help me get to a point where I've been before. So to be at this point tonight sitting up here talking to you guys, like I said, it's very emotional and veryâ€‘â€‘ just somethingâ€‘â€‘ I don't knowÂ  Could I foresee this?Ã‚Â  At the beginning of the season, I couldn'tÂ  I couldn't foresee us being in The Finals at the beginning of the season because I just knew that we just had to get better and I just saw how young we were and how youngâ€‘minded we were at that point in time, but I knew I had to lead these guys, and if they just followed my leadership, I knew I could get them to a place where they haven't been before.",
        "3": "It's a hardâ€‘working city, and if you work hard for this city, they work hard for youÂ  They give everything back to youÂ  That's what J.R. Smith to my right, Tristan here to my left, and the rest of the 12 guys in the locker room, we're just trying to work hard for the city, and they give it all back to us, as you saw tonight with 20,000â€‘plus fans.",
        "4": "I don't know how many chapters we have in the book as far as this season, but there's at least fiveÂ  Just from the start of the season to us making the transaction to acquire this guy to my right and then Shump and then Timofey, to us having injuries, to us getting to the postseason, to Kevin Love being out for the postseason, to Kyrie getting banged up and being out for playoff gamesâ€‘â€‘ we have so many different chapters to this season that's defined who we are. But one thing we haven't got caught up in is feeling sorry for ourselvesÂ  It doesn't matterÂ  If someone is out, the next man upÂ  If someone is not 100 percent, then as a brother, you pick that guy upÂ  That's what it's aboutÂ  That's what it's aboutÂ  That's what teamwork and trying to accomplish a dream is all about, being able to sacrifice yourself and what you can do for the better of the teamÂ  That's what's got us to this point. Don't ask me another question until you ask one of these guys a question too, by the way. J.R. SMITH:Ã‚Â  I'm outÂ  I'm done. LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  Don't say, hey, LeBron, I'm from channelâ€‘â€‘ don't ask me a questionÂ  Ask these guysÂ  Give me a break. J.R. SMITH:Ã‚Â  I could have stayed in the back. LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  But you look goodÂ  You fit. J.R. SMITH:Ã‚Â  I've never worn one of these before.",

        "12": "For myself, I think we all here know how long it's been since a champion has been in this cityÂ  I mean, you can try and not focus on itÂ  You can try to say, okay, well, it's not about thatÂ  But we all know it. The one thing that we can guarantee as a team, as a group, 15 guys, our coaching staff, people that travel with us on the road, whatever the case may be, that work every day, is we will give our best shotÂ  No matter who comes out of the Western Conference, either Golden State or Houston, we're going to give it our best shotÂ  Our coaching staff will prepare us the best way they can, and I will as a leader have our guys ready for it. Win, lose, or draw, because you can't predict the future, you don't know what's going to happen, we will give our best shotÂ  That's all from myselfÂ  That's all I can ask of my teammatesÂ  That's all I can ask of the coachesÂ  And I hope everyone here understands that it's not easyÂ  It's not easy to even get to this pointÂ  It's so hard just to win an NBA game, and the fact that we've won three playoff series so far, it is very, very difficult, and if you've never been in this situation, you don't know how difficult it isÂ  The only people who can talk about itâ€‘â€‘ one of my best quotes or favorite quotes of all time is Theodore RooseveltÂ  It's called the Man in the ArenaÂ  I suggest everyone read it. It's basically about, if you've never sweat or bled or been in an arena and having the dust go up in your face and never battled, you have no idea what it takes to be in the arenaÂ  So for me as a leader, all I can do is lead these guys, which I will doÂ  The coaching staff will give us the greatest game plan they can to win against Houston, to win against Golden State, but as far as guarantees, I cannot guarantee anyoneÂ  I can't guarantee the championshipÂ  That's not what I'm here forÂ  I'm here to leadÂ  But I will guarantee that we will play our asses offÂ  We will, from the first minute to minute 48, or if it's overtime, 53Â  We will do that. At the end of the day, that's all I can ask forÂ  That's all we can giveÂ  But we will be in The Finals, I can guarantee thatÂ  Appreciate it. J.R. SMITH:Ã‚Â  By the way, that Nike commercial, I wasn't in itÂ  They can add me in or something. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "3": "Are you, at this point in the season right now, do you feel like you're more banged up than you were previously at this times?",
        "4": "Obviously, (inaudible), but how good would it feel for to you get this city back to The Finals?",
        "5": "What's the key to closing out a series like this?",
        "6": "Can you describe the level of treatment you're getting?",
        "7": "LeBron, have you thought the quicker you can get this series over with, the more rest you can get going into the finals?Ã‚Â  But at this point in the season, does six or eight days or four or six days make that much of a difference?",
        "8": "How much can the group help you conserve energy (inaudible)?",
        "9": "Could someone cover your man for stints or help you out that way?",
        "10": "You guys were up 10 with about ten minutes to go and you needed overtime to win itÂ  Can it sometimes be a better thing to get a win that doesn't go by (indiscernible) versus one where Game 2 you kind of like handled it?",
        "11": "How do you feel now compared to when you had to go away for 10 minutes?",
        "12": "Feel better now?",
        "13": "LeBron, last night you touched on the fact that Matthew's been asked to do more than he's used toÂ  How do you think he's responded to the challenge on the court in that role?",
        "14": "Even before last night, you always spoke highly of himÂ  What makes him sort of a good teammate to have in your corner?",
        "15": "The Hawks seem to be insinuating that he's a dirty playerÂ  Are you tired of that kind of talking?",
        "16": "LeBron, how would you quantify Tristan's value to this team, to you, and his evolution from earlier in the season to what he is right now?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Yeah, I got extensive treatmentÂ  I'm not going to elaborate on exactly what I gotÂ  Just right after the game, just started trying to prepare my body and get ready for Game 4.",
        "1": "Well, I'm not concerned really in what other people have to say about what I do on the floorÂ  I know what I bring to the gameÂ  I know how much I work on my craftÂ  When you give everything and you work on your game and you give everything to the game, there's nothing really anyone can say to you that can really bother you.",
        "2": "I felt it would be, and it isÂ  We just haven't been whole since the first round, obviously, and then our Allâ€‘Star point guard goes downÂ  It's been a tough task for the guys that have been in the lineup, but they've done a great job of accepting the challenge. For me, I just try to lead those guys the best way I know how every single night.",
        "3": "I don't knowÂ  I've been banged up going into the postseason, going into round after round after roundÂ  I don't knowÂ  I would say yes because I just feel my body right todayÂ  But it's allâ€‘â€‘ I think, when you want to win, you've got to sacrifice your body feeling goodÂ  I've been fortunate enough to play until May a lot lately the last few years, and my body has sacrificed feeling goodÂ  That's just what it's about.",
        "4": "It's been my goal since I got back here, not only to get back, but to win, win the whole thingÂ  That's my goalÂ  It's part of my driveÂ  That's what it's aboutÂ  Obviously, we've got an opportunity to go back to a place where we haven't been in a whileÂ  So I'm looking forward to the challenge.",
        "5": "Just play like you played the last few games, the first three winsÂ  You don't add much more pressure to itÂ  You just go out and trust what you've been doing the first three wins and apply it to the fourth one.",
        "6": "Well, it gets to a point where you get sick and tired of seeing Mike ManciasÂ  He's almost moved in with meÂ  We have a very tight bond at this pointÂ  So it's okay.",
        "7": "You don't really put your mind into let's get this series over so we can get restÂ  You think, let's play this game so we can winÂ  And whatever the reward is after the series, then you take it.",
        "8": "I've had to, with the share with Delly, had to hand the ball off more than I would like toÂ  With Kyrie being out, that's just what it isÂ  It happened a lot in the Chicago seriesÂ  It's happened in this series since, obviously, Kyrie hasn't been in the lineup. That takes the wear on your legs throughout the course of the gameÂ  You have to handle not only a fullâ€‘court situation but halfâ€‘court situationÂ  So that's taken a little bit of a toll. Also at the same time, it's the playoffsÂ  The playoffs should take a toll on your body where you feel exhausted at the end of itÂ  That's just how I playÂ  That's how I've learned, when you go and play in the postseason, you shouldn't feel great playing a playoff game everÂ  A lot of intangibles going into how my body feels right now.",
        "9": "No, I don't let no one take my man.",
        "10": "Last night we put them on the freeâ€‘throw line after we got up 10Â  They stopped the clock and got into a rhythm and started making free throwsÂ  We put them on the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  We didn't make shots even though we had great looks. It's always great toâ€‘â€‘ it doesn't matter how you win a game, no matter if you win by ten or by three or by one, but the way we won it last night, defending once again, got stops, got timely stops, got timely baskets, and it's a great learning experience for our young group.",
        "11": "I feel better than that.",
        "12": "Yeah, I thinkÂ  I don't knowÂ  I don't know.",
        "13": "He's been greatÂ  Obviously, if he isn't our backup point guard, we're not sitting here with a chance to go to The FinalsÂ  It's just that simple.",
        "14": "He's a guy who's a true professional, comes to work every single day, learns every day. Ã‚Â He wants to learn, and he plays his heart outÂ  You can definitely be excited and happy for a guy like that.",
        "15": "Obviously, that's far from what he isÂ  He's a guy who beat the odds, who no one thought could play in this league, and now he's starting in the Eastern Conference Finals for a team that has an opportunity to go to The Finals. So as far as guys that play hard, as hard as he does, for him, some people try to tarnish what he does, to put a dirty label on it, it's an injustice.",
        "16": "Tristan should probably be a Cavalier for his whole careerÂ  There's no reason why he shouldn'tÂ  This guy is 24 years oldÂ  He's played in 340â€‘plus straight games, and he's gotten better every single seasonÂ  It's almost like what more can you ask out of a guy even though we ask for more out of him. He's a young guy, but he's a professional that loves to come to work every dayÂ  He plays his heart out every single night, and he has zero sense of entitlement in this leagueÂ  All he cares about is coming into workÂ  Whatever is given to him, he relishes the opportunity, and he's a great teammateÂ  So he'll be here for a long time.

        "0": "LeBron, after Mack misses the second three there, you drop to the floor and kind of slap the floorÂ  What was going through your mind at that point?",
        "1": "LeBron, you started 0â€‘forâ€‘10 tonight but still had an amazing stat lineÂ  Can you just take us through the slow startÂ  What got you going?Ã‚Â  And if you could, compare this to Game 5 in Detroit in '07.",
        "3": "LeBron, also, how are you feeling now?Ã‚Â  And what do you do to recover from what happened today?",
        "4": "LeBron, I've heard it said in the past, Larry Bird used to say that rebounding was mostly willÂ  You had 20 rebounding opportunities; you grabbed 18 of themÂ  Could you tell me about your will to rebound.",
        "5": "LeBron, Blatt described your injury as crampsÂ  I know you grabbed your leg several times during the gameÂ  Was this similar to what you had gone through in Miami in The Finals last year and previous years or something different?",
        "6": "For either of you, when you're out there, what responsibility do you have for the safety of the other nine guys on the floor?",
        "7": "In terms of style play, do you have to be mindful of whether it's running into a guy, whether you're going up for a foul, hard foul?",
        "8": "LeBron, that corner three has been pretty good to you these playoffs so farÂ  Is there anyâ€‘â€‘",
        "9": "Is there any story behind Tristan Thompson suggested that perhaps Damon Jones deserves some credit?",
        "10": "You tell us.",
        "11": "LeBron, would an earlier version of yourself have been able to handle an 0â€‘forâ€‘10 start as well as you did?Ã‚Â  Would it have affected you more a few years ago?",
        "12": "LeBron and Matthew, first of all, Matthew, DeMarre Carroll said that a player should never dive at another player's feetÂ  Okay to dive for a basketball but never to dive at another player's feetÂ  In the case of Korver in Game 2, in the case of Horford tonight, did you feel that you were guilty of doing any such thing?",
        "13": "Since you brought that up, Bron, when you talk about Antic, do you feel there's some things that the Hawks are doing that maybe Delly is getting some of the criticism for your team in general?",
        "14": "Can you guys talk about being a game away from making it to The FinalsÂ  And what needs to happen for you guys to get it done here?",
        "15": "LeBron, is that more pain than you've ever played through at any point in your career?Ã‚Â  And how do you do that when you're hurting and you just keep pushing through even when you're about to break?",
        "16": "LeBron, could you talk about Shump and J.R., how big they were tonight, how big they've been to the CavsÂ  The defense they play, the big shots they hit, maybe the emergence of Matthew also, especially in the light of Kyrie and his absence and what they've meant to you guys."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I gave it everything I had tonightÂ  My teammates didÂ  Played our tail off, and to be able to win the game like this, with so many ups and downs and so many lead changes, it's a huge win for our team.",
        "1": "I was struggling earlierÂ  I missed a lot of shots that I know I'm capable of making, obviouslyÂ  Missed a lot of layupsÂ  Missed a couple threes, and my teammates kept me afloat. I think I was 0â€‘forâ€‘9 at the end of the first quarter, but it was 21â€‘24 at the end of the first quarterÂ  We were in the game because of my teammatesÂ  They picked me up, and I just tried to do some other things while we were struggling offensively as far as shooting. For me, offense, as far as scoring, doesn't define my gameÂ  I've always wanted to be a triple threat in this league, being able to rebound and to assist and also to scoreÂ  So when I wasn't scoring and those guys were picking me up, I was able to do other things to help us go. Every game is different as far as the Game 5 in DetroitÂ  Compared to this game, it's so much differentÂ  It was a 2â€‘2 series at that point being in DetroitÂ  Tonight is a 2â€‘0 series being back homeÂ  This is much different, but the win feels great.",
        "3": "How am I feeling?Ã‚Â  I've been betterÂ  It will be aroundâ€‘theâ€‘clock treatment, as usual, to get my mind, get my body ready for Tuesday.",
        "4": "Well, we needed it tonightÂ  We gave ourselves 19 offensive rebounds, extra possessions when we weren't shooting the ball wellÂ  For me, we played a lot of small ball tonightÂ  But even when we're big, I just try to help our bigs out, try to help reboundÂ  It's good offense for us when I'm able to rebound, able to push the break. Just being in that mindset that I tried to get every rebound possible that was in my laneÂ  One or two I could have got, like you said, but just being in the mix and just helping us get extra possessions.",
        "5": "No, it's probably, it's the same thingÂ  I play to exhaustionÂ  I play hard and I give my teammates, and I give myself as much as I can giveÂ  Sometimes the body just kind of shuts down at times, and that's what happened tonight at one point. Even in the overtime, I asked to come out, but I had a second thought, and there was no way I can goâ€‘â€‘ I wouldn't have felt right about the situation, win, lose, or draw, if I'd have went to the bench and not being out there for my teammatesÂ  So it was mind over matter at that point.",
        "6": "What does that mean?",
        "7": "Well, you just play the game the right wayÂ  At this point, you try to do whatever it takes to winÂ  You don't want to hurt nobodyÂ  No one, I think, in our league goes around trying to hurt people, but you don't take the aggressive nature out of the game. I think in the case ofâ€‘â€‘ ever since you were a kid, the ball on the floor, the first man to the floor usually gets the ballÂ  There's no difference between what Delly did to Kyle Korver last game and 18 guys diving on the floor late in the game tonightÂ  It was like six or seven guys diving on the floor for that loose ballÂ  Delly was on the floorÂ  J.J. was on the floorÂ  Mike Scott was on the floorÂ  Shump was on the floorÂ  J.R. was on the floorÂ  Just no one got hurt. There's no difference between me boxing out or Al Horford boxing me out and Delly boxing someone outÂ  That is a fundamental boxâ€‘outÂ  That's all it isÂ  And we all know thatÂ  We don't never want to play with the integrity of the game and try to get people hurtÂ  That's not what it's about because we all want brotherhood at the end of the day, NBA familyÂ  But I play to win the game, and you play aggressivelyÂ  That's what it's about.",
        "8": "I need to shoot more from the corner (laughter)Â  No other three has been good to me, basically, is what you're saying.",
        "9": "Which side of the credit?Ã‚Â  The I'mâ€‘notâ€‘shootingâ€‘soâ€‘well credit orâ€‘â€‘",
        "10": "I mean he does, for sureÂ  We work every day, just trying to get the ball up there and not think about it too muchÂ  First of all, the offensive rebound by Doubleâ€‘T was hugeÂ  I seen in his mind that he wanted to go back up for that shot, and I yelled his name probably as loud as I could yell it because I wanted another opportunity. I just seen Paul Millsap running a little out of control, just gave him a pump fake, and I just stick to my routineÂ  Things that I worked on all year long, make or miss, and I would be satisfied with the result.",
        "11": "Well, not a few years agoÂ  A few is probably like three or fourÂ  I was still going to The Finals at that point. Probably 23, 24, 25 maybeÂ  I think just because I've had experienceÂ  It's not about the younger LeBron or anything like thatÂ  I've been able to have experience over the years that's helped me to get to this pointÂ  I really don'tâ€‘â€‘ my game is so much better than it was when I was younger, and I just try toâ€‘â€‘ everything that I've worked on over the course of years and the mental side of the game, I just try to incorporate that on the floor, no matter if I'm making shots or missing shots or whatever the case may be.",
        "12": "I got it. MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA:Ã‚Â  I can answer if you wantÂ  I saw the ballÂ  I dived on the floorÂ  If I stay on my belly, it's going to be a jump ballÂ  So I protect the ball and kick it out to a teammate. On the other one, I'm boxing him outÂ  He's pulling my left arm downÂ  I'm trying to stay up, and he's just pulling me downÂ  I mean, the tape's there. LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  There's noâ€‘â€‘ in Game 2, when Antic twoâ€‘hand shoves me out of the airÂ  The fact that I'm still playing, we don't talk about it, but he twoâ€‘hand shoves me in the airÂ  So what are we really talking about?Ã‚Â  Are we going to talk about us trying to win basketball games or about those guys trying to figure out a way that Matthew Dellavedova is this type ofâ€‘â€‘ this guy, he works his tail off every single dayÂ  He beats the odds, and he comes to play as hard as he can every single night. If they're focused on Delly, then they're focused on the wrong thing.",
        "13": "That's not really our concernÂ  Obviously, I'm a little bit off about it because this is my guy, this is my teammate, and this is a guy that goes out and works his tail off every single night, and people are trying to give him a bad rapÂ  He doesn't deserve it, and I don't like itÂ  But I'm not going to get involved in anything that's outside of basketballÂ  That's not my place. What I care about is how we prepare every single night, how we prepare in the film session, which we will have another one tomorrow, and how we go about trying to win a basketball gameÂ  That's going to get 99.9 percent of my mentalÂ  But I will protect my guys for sure.",
        "14": "Just got to doâ€‘â€‘ we defendÂ  Our coaching staff will give us a game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute itÂ  We had a lot of mistakes tonightÂ  We did some things well, but we had a lot of mistakes tonight that we can clean up onÂ  If we come in with our defensive mindset, as we've had the whole playoffs so far, we give ourselves a chance to advanceÂ  If not, then there will be a Game 5.",
        "15": "It's current, so I would say yeahÂ  I don't remember how I felt two years ago in a certain situation, but I'm playing through a lotÂ  It doesn't matterÂ  I don't want any sympathyÂ  There's no rest for the wearyÂ  If I'm putting on a uniform and I'm on the floor, I have to make things happen for our teamÂ  It's that simple. I'm not the only guy that's limpingÂ  I'm not the only guy that's crampingÂ  I'm not the only guy that's hurtingÂ  There's a lot of guys out there that's playing as well, and I'm one of them as wellÂ  So I've got to go out and help our team win, no matter where I'm at.",
        "16": "Those three guys, obviously, J.R. and Shump, to answer the first part of your question, they were huge tonightÂ  J.R. gives us a doubleâ€‘double, and no one talks about itÂ  Gives us 17 and 10Â  And obviously, what Shump does, he rebounds, he defends whoever you need him to defend, and he gives us 15 points tonight as well. And the guy next to me, he's been thrown into a situation that he wasn't thrown in all season for the most part, and that's starting, being our starting point guard, with Kyrie being absent the last couple gamesÂ  And those three guys have answered the callÂ  They've played exceptional basketballÂ  They've defendedÂ  They've done everything we need them to doÂ  We need them to do it a little bit more. It's just every game is going to be challengingÂ  As hard as it was to win tonight, Game 4 is going to be just as hard as it was tonightÂ  But those three guys are playing unbelievable basketballÂ  Without them, we wouldn't be sitting here at this point.

      "questions": {
        "0": "(No microphone) not to get lulled into a false sense of security when you win on the road like that?",
        "1": "I would assume that's been your message to the guys already?",
        "2": "You preached defense all year long, and there were times when that wasn't really a strength in your groupÂ  But during the playoffs it's defense first that really matteredÂ  What's changed, or what do you like about the defense right now?",
        "3": "LeBron, last night you indicated you didn't know you'd get there defensively at times during the seasonÂ  At what point did you realize you could get there?",
        "4": "How does Kyle Korver being out affect anything you guys do defensively?Ã‚Â  Does it change your game plan at all?",
        "5": "What's the most important thing to keep the ball from getting thrown inside the way they like to do?",
        "6": "In February, when you first said that this team was maybe good enough to win a Championship, you guys didn't play defense like you play nowÂ  Then were you wondering, thinking that you could get there or hoping you could get there?",
        "7": "Are you aware at all about the verdict in the policeâ€‘â€‘ in the 2012 police shooting case from this morning?",
        "8": "Getting away from the actual verdict, downtown right now it's very calmÂ  With everything going on in the city now and then just kind of the temperament of the country in general, do you have any kind of message on just the community at large remaining calm?",
        "9": "Do you believe that the success of any team, a mature team in these rounds, can have any tangible, meaningful impact on a city that's going through a crisis like this?",
        "10": "Is that part of theâ€‘â€‘ all of the reason for you to come backÂ  But is that something that you also felt about, not just this trial specifically, but just this can help the city in some way?Ã‚Â  Whether you can articulate it or notÂ  Do you know what I mean?",
        "11": "They had you mic'd last night up at the end, and you told Kyrie, I've got your backÂ  We talked the last couple of days about playing through injuries and, if you're at 50 percent, you're out thereÂ  What message did you have for him or what, I guess, were your thoughts on him resting last night?",
        "12": "When you were here the first time, it felt like you had to do it all by yourself a lot of timesÂ  You articulated thatÂ  It would appear, by losing Kevin and by losing Kyrie, that you might have those same feelings, but it looks likeâ€‘â€‘ did you ever feel that way?Ã‚Â  Obviously, you've had a ton of guys step up at different times this time around, but did it ever feel like you were back having to do it all by yourself again?",
        "13": "Is it just from growing up?Ã‚Â  Was that from anything specific in Miami?Ã‚Â  How did that expand?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "NopeÂ  We're just as desperate as we were in Game 1 and Game 2Â  We've got a lot to continue to prove to ourselves what we can accomplish, and we look forward to our challenge tomorrow.",
        "1": "They know my messageÂ  They know where I standÂ  They know how I approach each and every gameÂ  It's not about winning two, it's about winning oneÂ  And tomorrow protecting our home court, which we've been very successful with doing so far, but that's not a guaranteeÂ  That's nothingÂ  We've got to show up and show that we can play and play at a high level.",
        "2": "It's the commitment, the commitment to the game plan, first of all, that the coaches give us, and we go out and we execute itÂ  We execute at a high levelÂ  We cover for one anotherÂ  It's not always perfect, but we're communicating and flying around and helping each other, and that's resulted in us being in the position that we're in today.",
        "3": "I think the additions that we added definitely helped us be able to be more dynamicÂ  Adding J.R. and Shump and those guys in there, we kind of changed some of our defensive schemesÂ  I think our coaching staff did a great job of doing that and seeing what better fits our team at that point in time. From that point, we just startedto get a rhythm of how we wanted to play defensively, how we wanted to cover for one another, but it all started with communication, and the communications continue to get better and better every month, which is how comfortable we're getting with each other.",
        "4": "Not at allÂ  Not at allÂ  No matter who's in the lineup for them, we're going to approach the game the same way we did in Game 1 and Game 2, try to attack them defensively, try to make them do things that they don't like to doÂ  Even though they're a great offensive team, we just try to keep them off balance, keep pressure on them, make them take contested shotsÂ  When they drive, contest the shotÂ  Versus a high powered offense like them, you really can't stop them, just try to contain them, try to make it tougher on them than they usually see.",
        "5": "I guess you try to put pressure on the ballÂ  That's allÂ  They're very precise with their passingÂ  We know thatÂ  And they've been that all yearÂ  They've been that throughout the postseasonÂ  We just try to make it a little bit tougher when the ball is moved from one side to the other. We know they're going to emphasize thatÂ  That's where they've been successful all yearÂ  We know thatÂ  If it happens, that's okayÂ  We just have to be thereÂ  If the ball gets from one side to the other, we have to be there to contain both sides of the floorÂ  We've been doing that so far.",
        "6": "I think with the pieces we had, I felt like, if we continued to get better, we could compete for a ChampionshipÂ  I really truly believe that, and I've always preached that around hereÂ  If we work our championship habits both on and off the floor, we give ourselves the best possible chance to competeÂ  Obviously, I still think that today. We have a great group of guys that just love to play, that love to work, and true professionals about what it means to come to work every day and be great. Ã‚Â It's helped us on our floor be better.",
        "7": "I am aware of the verdictÂ  I'm not fully aware of all the detailsÂ  I'm not going to elaborate or comment too much on it because I don't speak upon something that I'm not fully knowledgeable aboutÂ  It's not where I standÂ  Obviously, I'm going to take a look at it and read upon it, and if I get more knowledge about it, then I may give a statementÂ  I may say something. But all I saw today was the verdict, and that's all I know about it.",
        "8": "Violence is not the answer, and it's all about trying to find a solution, for good or for badÂ  In any case, anything that goes on in our world, the only people we should be worried about is the families that's lost loved onesÂ  You can't get them backÂ  You can never get them backÂ  We should worry about the families and how they're doing and things of that nature. For the city of Cleveland, let's use our excitement or whatever passion we have for our sport tomorrow, for the game tomorrow nightÂ  Bring it tomorrow nightÂ  As our team, we try to do our best to give it back to them.",
        "9": "I think soÂ  I think sports in general, no matter what city it is, something that's going through a city that's very dramatic, traumatizing or anything of that case, I think sports is one of the biggest healers in helping a city out. Sports just does something to people, either if you're a player, if you're a fan, if you just have something that has anything to do with that city, you just feel a certain way about rooting for a team that you love that can get your mind off some of the hardships that may be going on throughout your life or in that particular time periodÂ  It just does that.",
        "10": "Well, I know my positionÂ  I know my powerÂ  I know my responsibilityÂ  I take it very seriouslyÂ  So whatever ways I'm able to affect anyone's life for the greater good, I'm blessed, and I'm happy I'm able to do thatÂ  I don't take it for granted.",
        "11": "I mean, for Kyrie, he has toâ€‘â€‘ obviously, he didn't feel like what he was going to be able to do was going to help the teamÂ  He felt like he was going to hurt the teamÂ  That's the only reason he would sit out, he felt like he was going to hurt the team. So I told him before the game, that's why we're a teamÂ  That's why it's next man up, and that's what I'm here forÂ  I got your back, and whatever decision that you decide to make, know that we're ready for you whenever you decide to come back, whenever you're ready physically and mentally to come backÂ  That's what it was about.",
        "12": "I never felt that I had to do it by myself, even in the pastÂ  Mentally, I just wasn't who I am todayÂ  I wasn't asâ€‘â€‘ my hard drive wasn't as big as it is today in the pastÂ  That's all it comes from. I'm able to handle a lot of situations that I wasn't able to handle at 24 and 25 and 23 years oldÂ  I letâ€‘â€‘ I just tried to do it by just playing the game of basketball, by just going out and just playingÂ  That's such a small dosage of what the game is all aboutÂ  The mental side is way more important than the physical and going out and playing basketballÂ  So that's where it comes from.",
        "13": "Just growthÂ  Just every experience that you have in life is the best teacherÂ  You go through so much, you just know how toâ€‘â€‘ the next time it comes upon you, you know how to approach it. Just like I told you guys in Game 1, I hated the way I play isolation basketballÂ  I wouldn't do it againÂ  I was put in the same position in Game 2 where we got up big and the ball was going to be in my hands in the fourth quarterÂ  I did not play isolation basketballÂ  It's just growth.

    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "1": "LeBron, what goes into those kinds of passes and how difficult are they, and how have you perfected that over the course of time?",
        "2": "LeBron, you guys collected more than a quarter of your shots today via offensive reboundÂ  How valuable was that for building the lead?",
        "3": "Atlanta was collapsing early on your drives to the basket and then we saw later in the game an uptick of you driving and then dishing outÂ  Was that an adjustment made based off how they were collapsing on defense?",
        "4": "LeBron, I guess it's sort of along those lines, but if you go back to after Game 1 of the Chicago series, it was your first game without Kevin, and you said with less offense on the floor you had kind of decided you would need to shoot more and play a certain wayÂ  When you come in tonight and Kyrie's not out there either and you have this game that you had with 11 assists and dishing it all over the place, just what made you switch again to playing, I guess, more of the point forward, distributor?",
        "5": "Earlier in the season when you passed Pippen for the allâ€‘time assists by a forwardÂ  You told us the assist is your favorite play in basketballÂ  I wonder if you could elaborate on why that is and the feeling you get when you help these guys score.",
        "6": "LeBron, two nights ago, you said you had the No. 1 defense in the postseasonÂ  It's hard pressed to find too many stretches of the year where you guys were a top ten defenseÂ  Why now?Ã‚Â  What's going on that has made you guys so good in the playoffs?",
        "7": "What are you all doing at halftime?Ã‚Â  You come out in the third quarter the last two games and shut them downÂ  What adjustments and what have you all seen in your game plan?",
        "9": "LeBron, both of you guys talked about what you've done defensivelyÂ  They've talked a lot about how they haven't played Hawks basketballÂ  They've played more iso than they typically playÂ  How much do you think what you guys have done, in terms of stopping their initial actions, has had to do with forcing them to play that way?",
        "10": "LeBron, do you ever think about just some of the guys that these last couple of games, you always, when you come up to the podium, you've got different guys joining you every timeÂ  What does that say about your team?",
        "11": "LeBron, how important was it in the third quarter to keep the pedal down, build that lead up, and maybe not just for this game, but for momentum purposes going forward?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "I've just seen every coverage that defenses can offer me, and I always try to be a triple threat on the floor, being able to score, to rebound, to pass, whatever the case may be, however the game presents itselfÂ  Just get my confidenceâ€‘â€‘ I give my teammates the utmost confidence that when I throw them the ball, to shoot with confidenceÂ  I just try to put it exactly where they need it to be, where all they've got to do is catch and shoot or catch and drive and make things happen. So it's something I learned when I was a youngster, understanding how important a pass is and how important it is giving your teammates confidenceÂ  When you have guys like the guy next to me and Delly and J.R. and the rest of the guys on down the line, I'm able to do what I love to do best.",
        "2": "Well, for us, offensive rebounding is part of our gameÂ  Threeâ€‘point shooting is a part of our game as wellÂ  We get 30 looks at the threeâ€‘point line, and we had 11 offensive rebounds that converted into 13 secondâ€‘chance pointsÂ  That's all a part of our game, it's part of our DNAÂ  When we do that, we're very successful.",
        "3": "I'm able to make adjustments throughout the game, just knowing how the defense read and reactÂ  Obviously, when you've got guys like here, who shot the ball extremely well tonight, the defense starts to go further and further away from the paint, and I'm able to see creasesÂ  When they react to me, I'm going to find my guysÂ  I'm going to know exactly where they're going to be every single time I driveÂ  That's just a repetition we have through our practices and watching the film and knowing where your guys are going to be, and they have outlets, and they make themselves presentable, and I just try to put the ball right where it needs to be. I'm able to gauge the game and watch the game and able to replay it back in my mind and understand what I can do to help us win.",
        "4": "That's how the game presented itselfÂ  When I was attacking, I was seeing guys openÂ  When they were bringing two to me, I was seeing guys openÂ  Like I said, I have the most confidence, the most confidence in my teammates to make shots and make plays. For me, that's my job is to put energy behind that ball when I'm finding themÂ  All they need to do is catch and shoot or catch and drive or make a play, and the game presented that tonightÂ  I was able to be aggressive at times getting to the rim, and then there was times where they brought two and three guys towards me, and I was able to find my guys, and they knocked them down.",
        "5": "Why that is, for me, more than scoring, you always get the excitement of two guys being able to benefit from a passÂ  If I score the ball, if I'm in an iso situation where I score the ball, it's just me, and I've always been accustomed to team basketballÂ  When I'm able to put pressure on the defense and then make a pass to a teammate and he's able to knock it down, I've always got the excitement of that more than anything. But I have a gift, and that's why I'm able to keep defenses off guard because, you know, they say, okay, we're going to make him score or make him passÂ  They really can't make me do what I don't want to doÂ  I go out, and I play the game the right wayÂ  And whatever that moment, that possession presents itself, I try to do what's best for our team at that very moment.",
        "6": "We've gotten smarterÂ  We've ramped up our communication to a level that, at times throughout the season, I didn't know we could get to, and we're flying around, and we're just helping one another in time of need. It starts with this guy, first of allÂ  Look at those allâ€‘defensive teams, and obviously he has a small window with us, but he will be on the allâ€‘defensive team in this league very soonÂ  It starts with him, his approachÂ  I love the defensive sideÂ  You have a guy like Dellavedova, who he takes a challenge and Doubleâ€‘T protecting the rimÂ  Mozzy as well in the starting lineup tonightÂ  And everyone else, everyone takes it seriously. We understand that ultimately, if we want to win long term, we have to defendÂ  It's going to give us the best possible chance to win because the ball don't go through the rim all the time, and you have to be able to get stopsÂ  We've been able to do that thus far in our 4, 10, 12 games in the postseason.",
        "7": "It's a total 360 from our last seriesÂ  We were terrible in the third quarter versus the BullsÂ  We understood, if we want to be really good, we have to come out with a little bit more sense of urgencyÂ  We have to play more pedal to the metal in the third quarter. Defensively, we've been locked inÂ  When the ball is entered, either if it's their possession or it's our possession, we've just been very, very in tune with the game plan, and that's allowed us to get some leads in the third quarter and push the game out of reach.",
        "9": "(Laughing)Â  How do I want to answer this question?Ã‚Â  We're the No.1 defensive team in the postseason for a reasonÂ  Obviously, it's a great offensive team that we're playing againstÂ  You can't stop a great offensive teamÂ  You just try to make it tough on themÂ  That's all we're trying to doÂ  We're just trying to make it tough on them every nightâ€‘â€‘ contest all their jump shots, be in tune with the game plan, keep a body on a guy like Korver, who can break open a game by himself. And that's allÂ  That's all we can doÂ  They're going to make shots, which they did tonightÂ  They still made some shotsÂ  There were some possessions where we thought we could have been a little bit more in tune, but we just try to make it tough on themÂ  That's all we can ask, and our coaching staff gives us the game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute it, and that's what we've been doing so far in these first two games.",
        "10": "It's next man upÂ  Guys are just taking the challengeÂ  It means everything to me to be able to share this podium with multiple teammatesÂ  On every given night, Delly and Shump and J.R. and Ky and TristanÂ  It could be James Jones nextÂ  It could be anybody. It means a lotÂ  It means that, first of all, what they do, they do it very wellÂ  I got teammates that they don't try to outdo what they can doÂ  They do what they do at a high level, and for me, I just try to lead themÂ  Lead them the best way I can, and they go out and work for me, and I try to do the same for them.",
        "11": "Well, we learned from Game 1Â  In Game 1 we had a big lead, and we started to play the clock, and that was my faultÂ  I took that straight to the headÂ  I knew, if I got that opportunity again, I wouldn't let that happen again. So we happen to have the same thing happen today, and we just kept our foot on the gasÂ  We had early shots in the shot clock, we took themÂ  If not, we executed, and we were able to continue our roll and continue to defend as wellÂ  That was very important."

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, coach just called you a modern day Superman in terms of your ability to constantly bounce back from injuriesÂ  Of all the things you've done in your career, is that at or near the top of your list.",
        "1": "LeBron, you've rolled your ankle like that dozens of times over the course of your careerÂ  When you do it, what goes through your mind right at that moment as you limp off the court in pain?",
        "2": "You've been very fortunate in terms of not missing too many games with your injuriesÂ  Is there any one that sticks out that you played through that's particularly difficult or caused you a lot of discomfort?",
        "3": "Was it like swollen or strained?",
        "4": "How much of coming back into a game after you roll it badly is just pure threshold of pain tolerance and how much is will?",
        "5": "LeBron, when they put a bigger defender on you, does it change your approach at all?Ã‚Â  Like when DeMarre went out and they ended up putting Millsap on you, does it change your approach?",
        "6": "Earlier reports are DeMarre, no structural damageÂ  He might actually be able to continue in the series, possibly even tomorrow nightÂ  What are your thoughts just on the injury not being as serious as what it seemed?",
        "7": "LeBron, last night you shared a chuckle when J.R. said he has a hard time passing the ball when his shots are going down like thatÂ  How have you grown to appreciate a shooter like that?Ã‚Â  Have you played with anyone who shot like that?Ã‚Â  How do you balance knowing that it's not always the most high percentage shot on the court but it's going in?",
        "8": "He had three assists.",
        "9": "Nobody's ever done thatÂ  Make eight and eight.",
        "10": "I'm talking about the reboundsÂ  He's never done that.",
        "11": "First team Allâ€‘NBA againÂ  What does that mean to you?",
        "12": "You talked about Kyrie last nightÂ  Coach Blatt just said hopeful that he'll play tomorrowÂ  Any doubt in your mind he'll be out there?",
        "13": "You said in the past we need everybody to step up, especially with Kevin Love being downÂ  Are you surprised that every night it's somebody different and the fact that the leastâ€‘â€‘ the guy that you least expect to do it is the guy that ends up coming up big for you guys?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I take my body very seriously, and it's not what you see on the floorÂ  It's what I do off the courtÂ  The days off and in between games, where I take care of my body and take it very seriouslyÂ  I mean a lot to this team, and I don't want to have to have an injury. Obviously, I can't predict themÂ  You don't know if they're going to happen, but if you take care of your body beforehand, sometimes it makes the process easier to come back from.",
        "1": "Not againÂ  That's the first thing that comes to my mindÂ  I just try to get a feel for itÂ  I try to start stretching it out, tie my shoe even tighter to see if I can give it a goÂ  I've been fortunate enough that I've been able to do it.",
        "2": "I'd probably say my right elbowÂ  I think it was in '09 or '08, when we were making our run here in Cleveland my first stint. It's just I couldn't shoot the ballÂ  I couldn't extend the ballÂ  I don't know where it came fromÂ  Right after the season, it went awayÂ  It's the most frustrating thing I've been through while trying to make a championship runÂ  That's the one I can kind of go off the top of my head with.",
        "3": "It wasn't swellingÂ  I don't know what was going onÂ  I took multiple MRIs, got it checked, nothing they could findÂ  Must have been a lot ofâ€‘â€‘ just workedÂ  It stopped me from doing a lot of things.",
        "4": "I think it's a combination of all of itÂ  My trainer says I've got a high tolerance for painÂ  So what may keep some guys out, I'm able to come back fromÂ  Also, it's just a will to be out there with my teammates and just give them that presence on the floor, no matter if I'm able to do what I do normally or just give them half of what I can do.",
        "5": "No, it doesn'tÂ  I just try to stay in attack mode and put pressure on their defenseÂ  Last night I got too much away from what we needed to do offensively as a teamÂ  Because he was in foul trouble, I was trying to get him in even more foul trouble, but I've got to do a better job of keeping the ball moving from side to sideÂ  But my approach doesn't change no matter if it's a smaller guy on me or bigger.",
        "6": "That's great news not only for DeMarreâ€‘â€‘ that's the most important, for himâ€‘â€‘ but for their teamÂ  If he's able to go tomorrow night, I'll be very surprised, but it would be good to see him back on the floor at some point because you just don't want someone to end their season over something that looked like it was a season ending.",
        "7": "When a guy has it going like that, you don't mind him taking a couple of offâ€‘balance shots, a couple of contested shotsÂ  He's 8 for 12 from the threeâ€‘point line and should have took four or five more. I think all of his shots was in rhythm for himÂ  His in rhythm is different for a lot of in rhythmÂ  Those shots are not in rhythm for myself, but for him, those are in rhythm shots, and you can see the rhythm that he hadÂ  They were barely touching the net.",
        "8": "And eight reboundsÂ  So more energy to shoot the threeâ€‘pointer.",
        "9": "So he did pass the ball a couple of times.",
        "10": "Yeah, rightÂ  It was big time.",

        "12": "We're all hopefulÂ  I don't have any doubt right nowÂ  I don't think he's gotten worse from last night to todayÂ  He just needs to continue his treatment and continue the things that need to be done to get to this point, and hopefully he can get ready for Game 2.",

    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "1": "You and DeMarre seemed to be jawing a bit in the first half, but after he went down, you seemed to share a momentÂ  Can you share what you said to him?",
        "2": "LeBron, could you tell us the difference or which, I guess, the group of shooters that you played with in Miami and compare those to this group you have now because both can explode.",
        "3": "LeBron, can you talk about the play in the last 37 seconds, when you went for a dunk.",
        "5": "LeBron, when the organization first approached you and said, we can make a move to get J.R. Smith but we have concerns, what was your idea about the importance and the value of getting a player like this in your franchise?",
        "6": "You said you planned to take care of it?",
        "7": "LeBron, what worked for you for the team defensively against the Hawks against their threeâ€‘point shooting?Ã‚Â  And for J.R., how important was it for you to keep things rolling after you got hot early?",
        "8": "LeBron, you touched on it a little bit, but two quick questions:Ã‚Â  What was it that you saw in J.R. that made you very in favor of bringing him to Cleveland?Ã‚Â  Number two, what type of satisfaction do both of you get after having a game like this against the Hawks?",
        "9": "Two questions:Ã‚Â  One, could you take us through what happened in the third quarter, I think when you stepped on the camera guyÂ  And then, two, after some really good quarters offensively, second and third quarter, you guys seemed to get out of rhythm a little bit in the fourthÂ  What happened there until you finished with that dunk?",
        "10": "LeBron, what Kyrie's going through right now, can you say anything to him?Ã‚Â  Is this something that he has to become resigned to the fact that maybe the rest of the playoffs he'll be laboring through these injuries?",
        "11": "LeBron, you mentioned the defense in the postseason for you guys, giving up 51 to Atlanta in the first half and then 38 the rest of the wayÂ  What changed in the second half for you?",
        "12": "LeBron, you mentioned the iso ballÂ  Do you know, in the midst of it, in the middle of the game, can you feel it slowing down?Ã‚Â  Can you feel you're doing it too much?Ã‚Â  Or is it only after the game when you can kind of decompress a little bit and look at the numbers?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "At the end of the day, we're all a brotherhoodÂ  NBA is a brotherhood, and you never want anyone to get injured, even in combatÂ  So that's what went through my mindÂ  Obviously, I love competing versus anybody who loves to compete as wellÂ  He's one of those guys that was competing throughout the night, throughout the postseasonÂ  I'm not sure the severity of the injury right nowÂ  But I hope he has a recovery, whatever it isÂ  You just don't want nobody to get hurt like that.",
        "2": "I've been fortunate enough to play with some shooters to help spread the floor for myself and what I do best, and that's being in attack modeÂ  To be able to play with one of the allâ€‘time greats in Ray Allen, and also play with Mike Miller and Shane Battier and James Jones still, and then you get a guy like J.R. Smith, who's able just to shoot the ball and have the extreme confidence that every time they let it go, that it's going inÂ  I've been blessed to play with guys like that. When you have guys like that, you have to utilize them while they're on the floor.",
        "3": "Coach drew up a play, and we just try to run it to perfectionÂ  He drew up a play, and Doubleâ€‘T came up and set a screen and rollÂ  I was able to get to the middle of the floorÂ  The ability, the way we were shooting the three ball tonight, kind of kept those last two defenders at bay, and I was able just to turn the lane and make a big play for our team at that time.",
        "5": "Get him here, and I'll take care of it.",
        "6": "Yeah, I got himÂ  You get him here, I got himÂ  Yeah, I got him (laughter).",
        "7": "We have a great coaching staff, first of all, that gives us a game planÂ  We kind of, throughout these six days, we've kind of been balancing ways we can try toâ€‘â€‘ not stop what they do, but just try to limit some of their touches, limit some of Kyle Korver's touches and some of their other threeâ€‘point shooters. We're the number one defensive team in the playoffs, and it has a lot to do with when we go out, as a coaching staff, they give us the game planÂ  And for us as players, we go out and execute itÂ  For us to win ultimately, we have to defend. Tonight we shot 44 percent from the field, but we defendedÂ  We gave ourselves a chanceÂ  When you defend at a high level, you give yourself a chance to win every night. J.R. SMITH:Ã‚Â  I just try to just roll with the punchesÂ  I mean, once the team pretty much starts closing out, just try to get in attack mode, and at the same time, try to find my teammatesÂ  It's kind of hard, hitting the shots I was hitting, to try and pass the ball, but you've got to figure out a way.",
        "8": "Me and J.R.'s history go back long before he came into the NBAÂ  Before he came into the NBA, he came to my hometown, and we worked out multiple days, multiple timesÂ  For me, as a leader of a team, you always just want to try to give someone an opportunityÂ  With the talent this guy presents, I knew the man he was, and I didn't really care about what everybody else thought about him. Obviously, our front office, they have the last say so, and for me, they have the last say so, but when they made it and said they were going to do it, I was definitely all for itÂ  I felt like, for me, we were getting a great piece, not only on the floor, but off the floor, as well, because I'd known him before he even got to this point. To answer your second question, to be able just to make plays to help your team win is all that matters for meÂ  We have a guy like this that was shooting the ball extremely well, who broke the game open, but also the contributions from Delly off the bench again, and the two bigs, both of them having doubleâ€‘doublesÂ  That was big time.",
        "9": "Like you said, in the third quarter, I went to contest DeMarre Carroll's threeâ€‘point attempt, and the cameraman, I guess his foot was out further than it should be, but I stepped on his foot and turned my ankle. I'm happy that it didn't cost me the rest of the gameÂ  I was able to go out there and make a few plays. I think, to answer your second question, we can't worry about how many points we're up or how many points we're down; we have to continue to play our gameÂ  It starts with meÂ  I take all the responsibility for itÂ  In fourth quarter, I played way too much isolation basketball, oneâ€‘onâ€‘one basketball, a lot of defenses set, and I was letting the clock run down way too muchÂ  I just had to take the shot or I was giving it to my guys late in the shot clock, and they couldn't do nothing with it besides shoot it or turn the ball over. So I will do a better jobÂ  I'll probably watch the game over again tonight, as I try to get my body ready for Game 2Â  So it starts with me.",
        "10": "It's tough, and I know it sucks for himÂ  This is the moment he's been waiting forÂ  This is the biggest stageÂ  Physically, he's not capable of doing what we all know he's capable of doing, and it's starting to, I guessâ€‘â€‘ hopefully, it doesn't continueâ€‘â€‘ or hopefully it doesn't get into his mindÂ  For me, that's my role at that point, to let him know when he's on the floor, no matter what he's going through, we need him to be aggressive, as aggressive as he can be with the injury, and not worry about things that he cannot control; only worry about the things that he can control. Like I said, that will be my job to help him understand, no matter what he's going through physically, never let it creep into his mind where it affect him mentally.",
        "11": "We started to get kind of a rhythm of what they wanted to do, but we also just put pressure not only at the point of attack, but when the ball was moved from side to side. Like I said, our coaching staff gives us a game plan, and it's up to us to execute itÂ  They're going to make shotsÂ  They're one of the, if not the best with Golden State, best offenses we have in our leagueÂ  We just try to make it tough on them.",
        "12": "I kind of sense itÂ  I sense it during the game a little bit, and it's tough sometimes with our main ball handler not being on the floor, and that's in KyrieÂ  That's something that I'm not happy with, something I'm not really comfortable with doingÂ  I can do it, but I don't like to play that much isolation basketball late in the gameÂ  I'd much rather get the ball moving from side to side and get a good look after that. So like I said, I'll be more conscious about that in Game 2, if that opportunity presents itself, where at least I can get the ball moving to start and then maybe at the back side, or like the third option I can get it back at the endÂ  At least we got the defense moving instead of them just watching me pound the ball for 24 secondsÂ  That's not good basketball."

        "2": "LeBron, how does that feel when you play in The Garden, and in front of the great friends in the Allâ€‘Star Game?",
        "3": "LeBron, you talked a lot about kind of where you are in your career right nowÂ  As you go against some of these younger guys that are in the game right now, how much do you enjoy that and still showing what you can do at this level?",
        "4": "LeBron, now with the extended Allâ€‘Star Break, how eager are you to get rested and rejuvenated for the second half?",
        "5": "If you can give Russell Westbrook one piece of advice that would make him a better basketball player, what would that be?",
        "6": "What do you mean by that, \"stop caring about what everybody else thinks\"?",
        "7": "LeBron, the way you felt Thursday night coming into the weekend, you were kind of unsure how you were going to approach this oneÂ  When did you decide and know that you were going to attack the way you did?",
        "8": "LeBron, you've expressed your appreciation and affection for The Garden quite a lot in recent days and recent years, yet it appears you never came close to signing hereÂ  Why is that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Don't get no better, man, you play in The Garden in front of these fansÂ  They know the game of basketball and to be able to go out and represent my team and represent this league at the highest levelÂ  It means everything. Any time you're in the conversation with a great is very humbling. Ã‚Â It's an honorÂ  And I just got to keep getting better and better hopefully, and keep understanding how I got here and why I'm here.",
        "1": "I think Westbrook came for it from the startÂ  He's unbelievableÂ  He's an unbelievable talent in our leagueÂ  His motor, his athleticism, his demeanor about how he approaches the game, it's all greatÂ  And it's great for our leagueÂ  And he showed that tonightÂ  Showcased it on a big stageÂ  And it's great. To answer your second question, anytime I get an opportunity to be with my brothers, Dâ€‘Wade and Melo and CP is always greatÂ  We don't take these moments for granted.",
        "2": "It feels greatÂ  I love it.",
        "3": "You definitely enjoy itÂ  I was one of the young guys at a timeÂ  I was seeing the older guysÂ  And you try to make your markÂ  And now being in the reverse role, you just know that our league is in good handsÂ  I'm going to try to continue to do what I need to do to represent this league with the utmost respect both on the floor and off the floorÂ  But our league is definitely in good hands with the young group of talent that we have that's playing great basketball right now.",
        "4": "I'm excitedÂ  I'm excited what our team can accomplishÂ  We entered the break playing some really, really good basketball; winning 14 of our last 16Â  I'm going to take these next couple of days off and get back in the gym on Wednesday a little bit, go hard on Thursday and get ready to play Washington on Friday.",
        "5": "Be Russell WestbrookÂ  Stop caring about what everybody else thinksÂ  So he doesn't have to change.",
        "6": "Just be yourselfÂ  Just be yourselfÂ  That's allÂ  That's all that mattersÂ  Russell Westbrook is one of the best gifted talents this game has ever seenÂ  And he goes out every night and proves that and shows itÂ  I don't need to tell him anythingÂ  He's doing great.",
        "7": "Just the feelÂ  I understand that my fans and our fans for this great game voted me in for a reasonÂ  They wanted to see me playÂ  They wanted to see me do what I've been doing this yearÂ  And that's why they voted me inÂ  It's my obligation and my responsibility to go out thereÂ  If I'm feeling 80% or 85% or 90, to go out there and give my fans somethingÂ  Give my fans what they wanted to seeÂ  And hopefully I did that",
        "8": "I don't knowÂ  Just didn't work out that wayÂ  I spent my first seven years in ClevelandÂ  When I became a free agent in 2010, I felt what was best for me was to go to MiamiÂ  And when I became a free agent once again this past summer, I thought what was best was going back homeÂ  My family was feeling very comfortableÂ  And that's how it go.

        "1": "To improve the game?  I think the game is at an all-time high right now in our league.  I don't see us improving the game or anything right now.  I think the league is great.  Both conferences are doing extremely well.  We just want to continue to grow.",
        "2": "Well, I think the problem sometimes in sports is everyone -- they want instant success.  And I understand, being a part of the process before, that it takes time.  It takes time for a team to gel.  Especially a new team to gel and come together and build camaraderie.  That's exactly what we're going through. We were going through early season struggles because we didn't know each other both on the floor and off the floor.  But over the last month or so it's clicked.  And I think it has a lot to do with us gaining each other's trust and learning each other, and we've played some really good basketball, winning our last 14 out of 16 before the break.",
        "3": "Every day we get closer and closer.  I think he's great.  He's handled his first stint in the NBA extremely well so far.  And I'm happy to be playing for him.",

        "5": "I think the three pieces we have to start with, J.R., he's given us a knockdown shooter and a defensive guy.  He's very underrated defensively and very underrated with his passing.  Shump is a true professional and only cares about winning.  And that defensive grit he has, we don't have many guys like that in our league.  And that's just added to our success.",
        "6": "Consistency.  You have to do it over and over and over.  Every year.  It's not just doing it one season or one month.  You have to do it year after year after year.  And you know when teams gun for you and you're still able to produce every single night, I think that's what defines it.",
        "7": "Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Winning is everything.",
        "8": "It's obvious; they're winning because of those two guys.  Their motor, their ability to make shots, their ability to have fun, and they -- you can tell they play with so much chemistry and camaraderie because they love each other.  From outside looking in obviously I don't know, but it looks that way.  And everyone just follows their lead.",

        "6": "Yeah, the 23rdÂ  So at the 23rd mark, if he comes aboard and he signs, I can tell you I'm going to be very excited, very excited to have himÂ  He's one of those guysâ€‘â€‘ I don't even care about the 26 and 12Â  I care about the basketball IQÂ  His basketball IQ is very, very high I had the opportunity to spend 32 days with him on the 2012 Olympic teamÂ  I always told himâ€‘â€‘ it's funnyÂ  I always told Kevin Love, like you're very good, manÂ  Like he always thought I was likeâ€‘â€‘ I got kidsÂ  I can't reallyâ€‘â€‘ blowing smokeÂ  I don't even know if I should say that with the kidsÂ  Gassing him a little bit I always told him how he is going to be a reason why we won the gold medal, and he played a huge role for us being undersize as a big with just Tyson, myself, Melo, and Kevin Love I'm looking forward to itÂ  Hopefully, it happens, and everything is done right from a league rule and standardÂ  But he's a great piece.",
        "7": "That is true.",
        "8": "I think, first of all, just my presence alone will give back to the cityÂ  These kids are going to get most of it When I get on the floor, that's when the city will benefit from me being back because I play the game at a high levelÂ  I respect the game at a high level, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to help us win As far as what I do off the court, I'm going to help these kids and lead these kids to become greater than maybe even some of the people in their own household think they can become I think my presence alone will raise everyone's excitement, and not only in Cleveland, but in Akron and Northeast OhioÂ  But these kids is more important, as far as what I do off the court.",
        "9": "Well, for me, growing up in a single parent household, everything was earned, and nothing was given to my motherÂ  The way she approach life is she doesn't care about anything as long as her son benefits from everything and get whatever she grinds for That's basically where it came fromÂ  I seen my mother struggle a lot, and as I saw her struggle, I never wanted for anything. Ã‚Â I have no idea how she did it Me beingâ€‘â€‘ me having a wife and grandparents around and other helpers around every single day, it's still difficult to be a parent myself, and I got so much assistance and financially assistance as well that my mother nowhere near had, and she was able to do it by herself So that's where it basically comes from, that everything in our life was earned and not given.",
        "10": "Besides off the court, I gave you what means the most to meÂ  On the court, that's what means the most to meÂ  It's my driveÂ  It's my only drive Obviously, I understand that it's going to be a processÂ  I'm going toâ€‘â€‘ you know, I've returned home, but it's a different situation than when I left itÂ  The team that I left, we had been through the grindÂ  We had been through the strugglesÂ  We had lostÂ  We had wonÂ  Never got to the mountaintop, but we've been through so muchÂ  This is different So many great pieces on the team, but none of the guys, besides Andy, at this point, even if you include Kevin Love, you know, has been in pressure games in the NBAâ€‘â€‘ and Kevin Love has won a gold medal, I don't discredit thatÂ  Kyrie has done some great things, but there's not many guys on our roster besides myself, Andy, J.J., and Mike Miller that's done some great thingsÂ  So I'm going to have to teach and lead and inspire those guys But my number one goal is to win a championship hereÂ  I think it will be the greatest achievement in my life, as far as on the courtÂ  Hopefully, Iâ€‘â€‘ that's my goalÂ  I've been back in the labÂ  So when I get focused, I really go inÂ  So I'm looking forward to the challenge.",
        "11": "It's not going to changeÂ  It's still a processÂ  Even my first year in Miami, we went through a process and went through some tough timesÂ  We were 9â€‘8 at one time, and things didn't look like they were going to get right, and we figured it out, but we still ended up losing The FinalsÂ  I feel like that catapulted us to win backâ€‘toâ€‘back championships Even with the veterans that we've brought in, even if we're able to acquire Kevin Love in the two weeks from nowâ€‘â€‘ or less than two weeks, whatever it isâ€‘â€‘ it's still going to be a processÂ  I know thatÂ  I know that firsthandÂ  It was a process when I was here in Cleveland to even get to The Finals in '07, get to the Eastern Conference playoffs, get to The Finals in Miami, and we went four straight times, but it was always a process each and every year no matter what you go through So it's going to be a challenge for us because, like I said, a lot of these guys that's going to be playing big minutes for us haven't been through itÂ  They haven't been through itÂ  In order to be successful, you've got to have some pitfalls, and I knowÂ  I know firsthand To answer your second question, it was just Coach Blatt heard that I was in New York two weeks agoÂ  I was shooting a movie, and he stopped by, brought his daughters with himÂ  I got an opportunity to meet his daughters and meet him and just sit down and just kind of talk about a little bit of everything, the team, how was the movie goingÂ  He actually was on set and watched a little bit of the movieÂ  He said, I hope you're notâ€‘â€‘ I hope I don't say this, but you might be a better actor than you are a basketball playerÂ  So that made me get in the gym So I think he's going to be coolÂ  I think Coach is going to be greatÂ  Obviously, I'm going to spend some more time with himÂ  But the first thing I did when I decided to come back, I went online, and I looked up David Blatt's offense because I heard he was an offensive guyÂ  I watched all his clips from him coaching at Maccabi, and I kind of broke them down to see how I fitÂ  Obviously, I can fit in every position on the floor, so I just watched it Not only Coach Blatt, but also Coach Lue and James Posey and the rest of those guys and Phil HandyÂ  There's so many guys on the coaching staff that I'm looking forward to kind of being around You dropped somethingÂ  That's a Samsung too, by the wayÂ  I'll tell you, it won't break I'm looking forward to itÂ  That's my next phaseÂ  I'm looking forward to getting with Coach Blatt and getting things goingÂ  I wish it wasâ€‘â€‘ what is it right now?Ã‚Â  August 8th?Ã‚Â  I wish it was September 8th and camp was starting in 20 daysÂ  But I've got a little bit of time, and I'm not going to rush it"

        "1": "To followâ€‘up, obviously, you have a very big decision coming upÂ  How will this game impact that decision, and what do you think your potential timetable will be on your decision?",
        "3": "You came to Miami to win as many titles as you canÂ  Do the Heat have â€‘â€‘ Wade, Bosh, everybody, do they have enough in the tank to win more going forward as constituted now?",
        "4": "A real quick followâ€‘up, did you notice, by chance, the swirlingâ€‘â€‘ even Chandler Parsons was talking about what you were going to do this weekÂ  Everybody's been talking about you, you, you, you and CarmeloÂ  Have you heard that stuff and what do you think about that stuff if you've heard it or not?",
        "5": "In those first six minutes, was that the kind of basketball you were hoping for?Ã‚Â  Did you feel at that point like you guys were going to be able to make a standpoint?",
        "6": "Chris Bosh described thisâ€‘â€‘ the Spurs as the best basketball team he's ever played againstÂ  How would you characterize what you ran into in the Finals?",
        "7": "As a leader of this team, what do you tell your teammates, specifically the younger ones and the new ones, about dealing with a loss like this and how can they help you in the future?",
        "9": "LeBron, what are your thoughts about what you've learned over the years from management, coaches, just how the organization has treated you?",
        "10": "Kawhi Leonard is Finals MVPÂ  Could you talk about what you saw from him especially over these last three games and how much he's grown from last year?",
        "11": "LeBron, you said in February you couldn't picture yourself leaving MiamiÂ  Do you still feel that way?",
        "12": "How do you handle this loss at this point in your career compared to the other two times you lost in the Finals?",
        "13": "If you guys do return intact next season, the big three and a few other players, what do you need to add, change, to beat this Spurs team, if you were to meet them again?"

      "answers": {
        "0": "Oh, I mean, mixed emotionsÂ  Started off very well as a teamÂ  We had a great first quarterÂ  But from that point on, they were the better team, and that's why they're the champions in 2014.",
        "1": "I haven't even really thought about that just yetÂ  Not disappointed in any of my teammates, just wish we could have came through, played a better series, but obviously we ran up against a better team this year. Like I said, I haven't even thought about it yet.",
        "3": "I'm not even nowhere near at that pointÂ  You know, we went to four straight Finals in four yearsÂ  You know, we're not discrediting what we were able to accomplish in these four yearsÂ  We lost one, we won two, and we lost another one. Take 50% in four years in championships any dayÂ  Obviously, you want to win all of them, but that's just the nature of the gameÂ  You win some; you lose someÂ  You've just got to come back the next year and be better as an individual, as a team, and go from there. But I know me and D. Wade and C.B., not proud of the way we playedÂ  All three of us, that's the last thing we're thinking about is what's going on this summer.",
        "4": "I haven't heard itÂ  It really doesn't matter to me what people say at all.",
        "5": "Just wanted to try to inspire my teammates and came out very aggressive, made some shots, got to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  Tried to inspire my teammates to try to get a winÂ  Obviously, I didn't do enough.",
        "6": "I would agreeÂ  They were the much better teamÂ  That's what team basketball and that's how team basketball should be playedÂ  You know, it's selflessÂ  Guys move, cut, pass, you've got a shot, you take it, but it's all for the team and it's never about the individualÂ  That's the brand of basketball, and that's how team basketball should be played.",
        "7": "I mean, it's hard to say anythingÂ  I mean, everyone is going through their own emotions right nowÂ  Everyone deals with it a little differentlyÂ  For me, I keep my head highÂ  I understand the position I've been able to put myself and put this team in since I got here, so my head stays high and I'm going to stay positive and use this as another opportunity to get better next year. But everyone is different.",
        "9": "I mean, I play for my teammates every single nightÂ  I don't really get involved in management and all of thatÂ  That's not my jobÂ  I play for my teammatesÂ  I try to lead my teammatesÂ  I try to inspire my teammatesÂ  I let guys do their job and I do mine.",
        "10": "Very efficientÂ  I mean, he's very efficientÂ  The first two games he didn't play so wellÂ  I thought he attacked more in the last three games, shot the ball extremely wellÂ  Every year you gain more and more confidenceÂ  Guys give you confidence, and he played extremely well. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  Yeah, it's like he just played freeÂ  You could tell after the first two games, it seemed like his teammates went to him and said just play basketballÂ  He not only took what the defense gave him, he took what he wanted at times as well. So he's a young player who is growing up in this league, and everyone knows what Coach Pop says:Ã‚Â  He's the future of this teamÂ  And he did an unbelievable job of playing the role they needed him to play.",
        "11": "I mean, I will deal with my summer when I get to that pointÂ  Me and my team will sit down and deal with itÂ  I love MiamiÂ  My family loves itÂ  But obviously right now that's not even what I'm thinking about. You guys are trying to find answersÂ  I'm not going to give you oneÂ  I'm just not going to give it to youÂ  When I get to that point, I'll deal with it, and when it gets to that point.",
        "12": "First time I lost, as a team we were excited to get thereÂ  We were more excited to get there than to winÂ  You know, obviously, we would have loved to win that game and win that series, but the Spurs were more dominant than usÂ  They were more seasonedÂ  They had been there a few years and they took advantage of our youth and inexperience. Three years ago, our first year here, that was probably more hurtful than this one in the sense of we had put so much into it, we were going through so muchÂ  That Dallas team was the better team in that series as well. Obviously, they all hurtÂ  This year they dominated us from every facet of the gameâ€‘â€‘ offensively, defensivelyÂ  I mean, they all hurt, but I've been able to be a part of five of them, and I would love to sit up here and say I was 5â€‘0, but I'm notÂ  I'm 2â€‘3Â  But a lot of guys don't get this opportunity to even compete for a championship, and I've been blessed to compete for five of them in my 11 years so far.",
        "13": "I don't think it's just the SpursÂ  It's the whole leagueÂ  The whole league continues to get better every single yearÂ  Obviously we would need to get better from every facet, every positionÂ  It's just how the league works. The Spurs continue to get betterÂ  Obviously, they kept those three guys intact, but they continue to put guys around them, highâ€‘basketballâ€‘IQ guys around them, highâ€‘energy guys around them that fit into the system of what Pop wanted to do. Obviously, it's not just about the SpursÂ  It's about the whole leagueÂ  The whole league is excited about returning next season, and we'll see what happens. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "Look at your numbers in these Finals, 28 points, 60% from the floor, 61 from threeÂ  I know you're harder on yourself than anybody else, but has there been a point in the last couple days where you ask yourself what more you can really do at this point?",
        "1": "So what has your message to these guys been over the last 36 hours then?",
        "2": "You mentioned team basketballÂ  You haven't been the problem in the series, obviouslyÂ  What more do you need out of your teammates?",
        "3": "Dwyane just came out and said yesterday he went to the gym by himself to get a feel for the ball and smell the gym after what happened in the last game for himÂ  What do you expect from him in the next game, and how motivated do you think he is right now?",
        "4": "You talk about how you guys all get together well and talking about that for three yearsÂ  You do emote at times on the courtÂ  Are there times when a star teammate maybe doesn't get back on defense, isn't doing the right thing, where you might be more vocal than we see?Ã‚Â  And might there be a need to do that more often amidst a period of desperation like this?",
        "5": "As the Finals have progressed, a lot more speculation about the future of the big three has occurredÂ  Knowing that major decisions need to be made this summer, does that add to the motivation of getting the job done knowing that the team may not be the same as it is right now?",
        "6": "And do you think about your decision that needs to be made over the summer as well?",
        "7": "What have you done to get the problem with the cramps under control?Ã‚Â  I know you're drinking coconut water right nowÂ  What have you done since Game 1 to get a handle on that?",
        "8": "Was it really just an issue with the temperature inside the arena?",
        "9": "What's been the main problem for you guys defensively when it comes to fighting through or sorting out their screens?",
        "10": "You mentioned your ankle the other dayÂ  When did that happen and what is the status of it now?",
        "11": "Is it a sprain?",
        "12": "Energy has been a problem it seems like later on in Games 3 and 4Â  Is there anything you guys can do differently to conserve energy other than not falling behind so quickly?",
        "13": "Is there any major adjustment at this point that can be made?",
        "14": "You seem to be in a pleasant moodÂ  Are you angry, disappointed over the last couple days?Ã‚Â  What is your frame of mind like?",
        "15": "You seem to have a peace of mind maybe more than you did a few years ago about taking losses and the ups and downs.",
        "16": "You talked about sometimes you guys play good defense and they score, sometimes you don't and they scoreÂ  You guys had some defensive slippage this season in the regular seasonÂ  Do you feel like bad habits have come back to bite you at all in this series, or do you feel like even if you were playing your best defense in these last few years you'd still be in this hole?",
        "17": "Ever since I guess maybe throughout the entire playoffs it seems like you've always been the last voice that the team hears before they come out for warmâ€‘ups and with a million TV cameras around, we see some of thoseÂ  What will you end up saying tomorrow night, or is it always totally organic off the top of the head?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I haven't evenâ€‘â€‘ I haven't looked at my numbers because it's meant one win, and that's what it comes down to for us and for me personallyÂ  I feel like I haven't even looked at the numbersÂ  I had no idea what I was shooting from the field or what I was averaging. I've been telling myself I need to do moreÂ  Is it too much to ask myself?Ã‚Â  I don't knowÂ  I don't knowÂ  I need to do more because what I'm doing isn't enoughÂ  You know, it's just what I put on myselfÂ  If you told me I was averaging 28, shooting 60% from the floor and 61 from the threeâ€‘point line and we'd be down 3â€‘1, I would never give you another interview, Tim, and I like you (laughing). But that's what the team is all aboutÂ  It's team basketballÂ  But I put a lot moreÂ  I need to get to 32, and 65 and 65 from the field and threeÂ  It's just the pressure I put on myself, manÂ  It's what I've come to.",
        "1": "Well, just we need to win one gameÂ  That's all we can think aboutÂ  We can't think about forcing a Game 7Â  We have to win one gameÂ  Game 5, being here in a hostile environment, we know if we lose, the season is over. For me, it's like you either don't make the playoffs or you win a championshipÂ  There's no in betweenÂ  I don't want no firstâ€‘round victory, no secondâ€‘round victory, no Eastern Conference FinalsÂ  Either I don't make the playoffs or I would rather get my two months off, get my body rested or win the FinalsÂ  I don't want no in between. Obviously, we have a tall task, a tough task, but we're here, we're in the moment, and do your bestÂ  Just go out and perform, play basketball at a high levelÂ  Something you've been doing your whole lifeÂ  Live with the results, man, and go from there.",
        "2": "I just want my teammates to be themselves, manÂ  You know, I feel like I need to do more tooÂ  It's how I amÂ  My teammates are everythingÂ  Obviously I wouldn't be sitting up here with this, the NBA Finals thing behind me, without themÂ  You know, and they've been there all year, and I still believe in themÂ  The guys that are struggling, I believe they're going to have a big game tomorrowÂ  The guys that haven't been in a rhythm, I feel like tomorrow's going to be the best rhythm they've been in. Tomorrow might be the game where I need to be picked up like I was in Game 1 where I caught a crampÂ  I believe in them, and I ride with them no matter what.",
        "3": "Well, you expect everyone to be greatÂ  This is the biggest moment of the seasonÂ  But the game has to play itself outÂ  I expect for him to be greatÂ  I expect all our guys to be great or put themselves in a position where we can succeed. But that's why you also have to play the game as well and see what happens throughout the course of the game and then after the gameÂ  We can all wonder what may happen tomorrow or whatever the case may be, but you have to live in the moment.",
        "4": "It's easy to say that now being down 3â€‘1 in a seriesÂ  How I'll lead is how I believe a guy should leadÂ  How I believe is how I think I should leadÂ  I mean, you may be different, someone else may be different how they leadÂ  So I won't change my approach. I hold guys accountableÂ  I don't let things slideÂ  I hold guys accountable and I want guys to be great while they're out on the floor and do what's best for the teamÂ  If you do that, you put the team before yourself, then I can live with thatÂ  So my leadership approach is different from others and I live with it.",
        "5": "No.",
        "6": "No, no, not reallyÂ  I don't need any motivation about the summertime or whatever something that's going on after the factÂ  I live too much in the momentÂ  I can't worry about what goes on after this series is over withÂ  Win, lose or draw, I live now and worry about the future once it's upon me.",
        "7": "I just try to stay hydratedÂ  I haven't changed muchÂ  I've got the two and a half bags of IV after Game 1, and that got me above the curve, so I just kind of stayed in the same regimentÂ  I drink a lotÂ  I drink a lot of fluids, water and drinks, and hydrate all day long. So I haven't done anything that was kind of like out of my character or anything of that natureÂ  It's just something that I've had a few times in my career, and something that may happen again in the futureÂ  Hopefully, it's not the near futureÂ  I can't have it happen tomorrowÂ  Somebody's going to have to really come get me tomorrow if that happensÂ  So I'm just staying above the curve, that's all.",
        "8": "Well, I don't knowÂ  I don't knowÂ  Both teams were playing extremely hardÂ  It was obviously something I'veâ€‘â€‘ I haven't played in conditions like that since I was a kid where you had no choice but to play in conditions like thatÂ  But I caught cramps in the Finals game in our first time we won against OKC in Game 4Â  That took me out of the game for a little bitÂ  I don't remember it being extremely hot, but it is Miami, so it could have been a little warm in there. So it was extreme conditions in Game 1Â  But nothing I could have done about it.",
        "9": "Well, it's not the screensÂ  I think it's the motor that they're playing withÂ  It's the second situations, the third situations, the fourth situations, and we've watched film where we've been on top of exactly what they're doing and they've still made shots. We played â€‘â€‘ I think it was Game 3 at the end of the first quarter, we played the pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll, the second situation extremely wellÂ  Manu got the switch on Bird, we played exactly how we wanted to, he shot a step back three and it went in off the glassÂ  So it's the ones where you actually don't play it exactly how you should, and they still make you pay. You know, this is the No. 1 team in the league that they'll make you pay when you're right on top of what they're doing, and they'll make you pay when you make a mistake, and we have to limit the times that we're making mistakes when we're on defense.",
        "10": "I turned my ankle in Gameâ€‘â€‘ it happened Game 2Â  I fouled Manu, I believe, in the third quarter, and I kind of fell on the ground right in front of our benchÂ  Yeah, I think that was Game 2 in the third quarter and I turned it at that point or in the fourth quarter, and it's kind of been \"ahh\" for the rest of the series.",
        "11": "I don't want to say a sprainÂ  I turned itÂ  It's a little sore, but it hasn't limited me muchÂ  As the night goes on, it gets a little worse and worse, but I'm okay.",
        "12": "I actually think the energy has been bad from the startÂ  From quarter 1 we haven't matched their intensityÂ  Second quarter we've played some okay ballÂ  Third quarter our energy has been the best in the third quarters where we've tried to work and work to get back. When you exert that much energy versus a team like this who continues to move, who continues to get into their sets, continue to use the 24 seconds and move the ball, and move the ball, and move the ball, and they make those shots at the end of the shot clock, it takes a lot of energy from you doing that. We haven't played even basketballÂ  We haven't played good basketball since Game 2Â  So they've taken a lot of energy away from us because we've played catchâ€‘up.",
        "13": "I'm not the adjustment guy to askÂ  That's not my question (laughing).",
        "14": "Of course, of courseÂ  I'm extremelyâ€‘â€‘ I was extremely upset, sad, very emotional to myself after 3 and 4Â  I mean, you ask me, all the bad emotions you could have. Today is a new dayÂ  I have another opportunity to help this team keep our season goingÂ  But I also know thatâ€‘â€‘ I don't know, manÂ  I'm in a good place in my lifeÂ  It's basketballÂ  I understand it's the media and the sport is the greatest sport in the worldÂ  I love itÂ  It's done so many great things for me, but it's just basketballÂ  It's just basketballÂ  So I let itâ€‘â€‘ I go all into itÂ  I give everything to this game. But right after Game 4 I was in the ice tub in the locker room, and my two boys coming running in there talking about let's play some more basketballÂ  I was like, If y'all don't get away from meâ€‘â€‘ it's the last thing I want to do right nowÂ  But it puts things in perspective, and I'm able to have a clear head about it.",
        "15": "Well, I mean, two championships helps thatÂ  It helps it, for sureÂ  But understanding what means a lot to me. Ã‚Â Understanding what's important and understanding what's not important allows me to kind of just live in the moment and not focus on what's happened in the past. I can't control the pastÂ  I can't redo itÂ  I can live in the present, try to affect the future and live with the results while I'm in it.",
        "16": "Well, I mean, in the regular season I got frustrated a lot, but it was a lot because we have guys in and out of the lineupÂ  I'm all about chemistry and habits, and it affected our teamÂ  There were guys that didn't know if they were playing, did know they were playing, and it affected our team a little bit. I don't believeâ€‘â€‘ I believe when we got into the playoffs we got everything that we needed to happenÂ  We got guys healthy, and we got defensively exactly where we wanted to beÂ  Great offense beats great defense any dayÂ  But at the same time, we've had some mistakes, you knowÂ  And if we limit our mistakes, we give ourselves a good chance to win itÂ  If we don't, then it will be over tomorrow night, if we don't limit our mistakes, and it's just that simple.",
        "17": "Yeah, it isÂ  I have no ideaÂ  It would be in the range of:Ã‚Â  Why not us?Ã‚Â  Why not us?Ã‚Â  History is broken all the timeÂ  And obviously we know we're against the greatest of oddsÂ  No team has ever come back from a 3â€‘1 deficit in the Finals, but there was a point where no team came back from a 2â€‘0Â  There was a point where no team came back from a 3â€‘0Â  There was a point where no team came back from a 3â€‘1 deficit in the Western Conference Finals, and then Phoenix did itÂ  One of our teammates was on that team, James Jones. There is a point where no team came back from a 3â€‘1 or 3â€‘0 deficit in the ALCS, and then the Red Sox did it against the Yankees. So history is made to be broken, and why not me be a part of it?Ã‚Â  That would be greatÂ  That would be a great story line, right? But we'll see what happensÂ  I've got to live in the moment, though, before we even get to that point. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you left just before the start of the game, came back, and then left in the first quarterÂ  Was there any illness or injury or something that might have held you back tonight?",
        "2": "Obviously, it's not over, but you know the numbers as well as anybody in the leagueÂ  You know that nobody in the Finals has ever come back from 3â€‘1 downÂ  What is the attitude right now?Ã‚Â  Is it just about Sunday?Ã‚Â  Is it about making history?Ã‚Â  Is it something else?Ã‚Â  What is it right now?",
        "3": "LeBron, you got going with the big third quarter scoringâ€‘wise, what was it like at the end of that to look up and see that you had actually lost ground on the scoreboard during that?",
        "4": "Erik said this was surprising tonight, and Chris said overall it was kind of blindsiding what happened in these two gamesÂ  What was your reaction at the end when you were watching the last few minutes on the bench?",
        "5": "Have you ever in two games had a team be more successful moving you strong to weak, getting the ball to the weak side and finishing plays as San Antonio has the last two games?",
        "7": "LeBron, as a followâ€‘up, is there any real doubt creeping in at this point that they just may be better or is it something you still feel like you have to figure out?",
        "8": "LeBron, you talked about their ball movement a little bit, is it just about doing things harder or are there tactical adjustments that need to be made in your guys' view?",
        "9": "No, not really.",
        "10": "You guys have not faced a deficit like this since you came together as a group, but also you personally you haven't been down 3â€‘1 in a series since '09 in OrlandoÂ  Is there anything in the memory banks you can call on from that experience?Ã‚Â  How does your approach have to change facing this kind of desperation?",
        "12": "LeBron, how difficult is it to defend a team like the Spurs when they can get five or six guys to score in double figures every night?",
        "13": "When you go back home in the next couple of days, having two days off, it's a long time between games, and a lot of time to thinkÂ  How will you guys roll this around in your mind?Ã‚Â  What kind of soulâ€‘searching has to take place, and how much will that help you come back for Sunday strong?",
        "14": "LeBron, at times it seems as if the offense is struggling and stagnant, asking you to go oneâ€‘onâ€‘one, shoot deep threes, be amazingÂ  Can you talk about that pressure and how it might be mentally taxing on you after four years now?",
        "15": "Is it mentally exhausting?Ã‚Â  I don't think in any of the games you guys have had a lead in the first quarter, to have to come back from so many deficits and all of that on your shoulder?",
        "16": "Coach Spoelstra said that it's time to just look under the hood and no stone should be unturnedÂ  At this point are all of the stones already unturned going into tonight's game?",
        "17": "Trying to find any option to win the game."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, first time I left I went to go get retaped, retape my ankleÂ  It's been kind of bothering me for the last couple days, but I felt okayÂ  Second time I went back, I just had to use the restroom.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, man, we put ourselves in a position where it is about making historyÂ  But all we can do is worry about Game 5Â  We've got to worry about Sunday firstÂ  Try to go up there in a hostile environment, where we were able to steal one in Game 2, and try to get another one and go on from there. Obviously, I do know the numbersÂ  It's never been done before, but we're still a confident bunch, even though our heads are lowered down right nowÂ  Of course, being down 3â€‘1, and losing two straight games at home, that's just human natureÂ  But we've still got to go out and play on Sunday.",
        "3": "That didn't mean nothing, you knowÂ  If it's not helping us get into the game, it didn't mean nothingÂ  I tried to will us back into the game, but they continued to executeÂ  I continued to make shotsÂ  I had a huge third quarter, but it meant nothing.",
        "4": "I mean, they smashed usÂ  Two straight home games, got off to awful startsÂ  They came in and were much better than us in these two gamesÂ  It's just that simple.",
        "5": "I mean, coming into the series we knew that that's what it was going to be aboutÂ  They're a highâ€‘oil machine and they move the ball extremely wellÂ  They put you in so many difficult positionsÂ  If you're not right on time, right on target, they're going to make you pay for it.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, the series is not overÂ  We've got guys with too much pride to even start thinking about thatÂ  At the end of the day, our focus will be, how do we get better than we did in Game 3 and Game 4 here at home?Ã‚Â  We're going with that bunker mentality in Game 5. Like D Wade said, we'll get away from it tomorrow physicallyÂ  Mentally it will still be lingering aroundÂ  Saturday you start to get back into the flow of things, and then Sunday you go out and play and see what happens.",
        "8": "That sounds like a setâ€‘up question.",
        "9": "Not really?Ã‚Â  Man, they move the ball extremely wellÂ  They put you in positions that no other team in this league does, and it's tough because you have to cover the ball first, but also those guys on the weak side can do multiple thingsÂ  They can shoot the ball from outside, they can also penetrateÂ  So our defense is geared towards running guys off the threeâ€‘point line, but at the same time those guys are getting full steam ahead and getting to the rim, too. The challenge is as well, with them, implementing Diaw into the lineup has given them another point guard on the floorÂ  So Manu, Tony, and Diaw and Patty Mills on the floor at once, they've got four point guards basically on the floor at onceÂ  So all of them are live and they all can make plays. Ã‚Â So it's a challenge for us all.",
        "10": "No, because I didn't even remember that until you just told meÂ  Obviously, I'm a guy who always just kind of lives in the moment, manÂ  One thing you can't do is control what happened in the pastÂ  You can only focus on the present and hopefully you can do better in the future from your present time. For me, I'm here at this pointÂ  I'm here with the 3â€‘1 deficit, and me as one of the leaders of the team, I have to figure out a way to get us to a 3â€‘2 deficitÂ  And you worry about that, and everything else that's happened before you, you can't control it at this point.",
        "12": "Well, I mean, they're a difficult challengeÂ  Like I said, I stated it before because they have so many guys that can do multiple thingsÂ  Any little mistake you make, they make you pay for itÂ  So we have to go back to the drawing board once again, figure out ways we can slow down on the mistakes that we had and get better from it on Sunday.",
        "13": "Soulâ€‘searching, there won't be much of thatÂ  There won't be much of that at all for meÂ  Crazy thing is my two boys are running around in the locker room after the game was over, so I had no time to even think about the game anymoreÂ  They want to know what's going on right when we get homeÂ  So having my boys around will allow me to get away from the gameÂ  But I will still be in tune with what I need to do to help our team win, and that's my mindset. But as far as soulâ€‘searching, we're a veteran ballclub that's won a championship, that's won a couple championships, that's been to four straight FinalsÂ  We know what it takes to winÂ  We've just got to go out and do it. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  I think the biggest thing you can do is first individuallyÂ  There's no \"I\" in teamÂ  There is an \"I\" in individualÂ  You have to look at yourself and see what you can bring better to the game to be able to help this teamÂ  Then as a team we've got to continue to trust and believe in each other, like we've done for four years here, like we've done all seasonÂ  I'm confident that we will do that. I mean, you've just got to look at yourself first, and then after that, we look at each other and see how we can all help each other get better.",
        "14": "I don't really get caught up in what pressure is all aboutÂ  I mean, just go out and play basketball, play as hard as you can and live with the resultsÂ  For me, I do whatever it takes to help our team winÂ  If it's me going oneâ€‘onâ€‘one to try to help us win, if it's me getting guys involved and taking threes in rhythm, then I'll do itÂ  But I don't really get caught up in the pressure.",
        "15": "You definitely don't want toâ€‘â€‘ it's not on my shoulderÂ  It's notÂ  I understand I get a lot of the limelight in the press and all that, but it's not all on my shoulderÂ  I take a lot of it, but I do it for my teammates and I want them to put a lot of pressure on me in that sense. But going into the first quarter is how you start games off, and you don't ever want to go into the second quarter being downÂ  But it is what it isÂ  That is the way the series has played out thus farÂ  You know, we have another game on Sunday to kind of right the ship and get better from it, and not be down like we've done in these first four games, because it's not been a successful ingredient for us.",
        "16": "I don't even know what that means (laughter)Â  I got an engine underneath my hoodÂ  I have no idea what that means.",
        "17": "I mean, that should be the goal from the start, you knowÂ  Whoever can make plays and put your teammates in position to win, all the stones should be unturnedÂ  That shouldn't happen in The FinalsÂ  That should happen from day oneÂ  You come into training camp and you find guys, you put guys on the floor to complement each other, and you put guys on the floor, and we all help each other on the floor from the coaches to the playersÂ  So shouldn't wait until you get to The Finals for that. Thanks for clarifying that, too, because I had no idea what you were talking about (laughing). FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, this was some of what an uneven seasonÂ  Defensive struggles along the way, trying to find rhythm, some losses that were unexpectedÂ  Are you surprised that some of the problems you had during the season could resurface this late in the game like the defensive struggles, some of the uneven bench play, and how much of a concern is that?",
        "1": "Do you think some bad habitsâ€‘â€‘ you spoke about this during the season, maybe too many bad habits set in and maybe they came to roost a little later now in the playoffs?",
        "2": "How was a twoâ€‘hour film session like with Coach Spoelstra?",
        "3": "The way The Finals obviously is and how crucial every loss is, when you think back to Game 1 and the circumstances of that one and you think about Game 3 and how you guys came out, does that make those losses even more painful thinking about it?",
        "4": "Have you ever been a part of a game that it seemed like the other team was just making everything, like the Spurs were last night?",
        "5": "Is that because they were just hot or your mistakes more so?",
        "6": "How do you guys keep Mario from â€‘ he said just now this is a tough Finals for him and his confidence is starting to shiftÂ  How do you keep him up because you guys are going to need him?",
        "7": "You guys haven't lost backâ€‘toâ€‘back playoff games since 2012Â  What is the process like of bouncing back in the playoffs?Ã‚Â  Is it fair to say that you're comfortable in this situation, though you'd rather not be in it?",
        "8": "You've had your share of guys who attempted to challenge your talentÂ  Indiana, Paul George, and Lance StephensonÂ  Could you talk about the challenges of Kawhi Leonard, playing him and the game he had last night?",
        "9": "Erik talks about it owning mistakesÂ  What is that process?Ã‚Â  How are mistakes owned in the video session?",
        "10": "Chris's touches were way down yesterday from the first two gamesÂ  Is that just a product of the game kind of getting scrambled and you guys trying to will it back?Ã‚Â  Or was there something happening early in the game, too?",
        "11": "When did you realize at what point of your career that it was not wise to talk back to coaches in film sessions?",
        "12": "You said a few minutes ago you're not too concernedÂ  Do you ever get concerned or what would concern you?",
        "13": "You said you had to fix some things but you're not too concerned.",
        "14": "What's going on right nowÂ  What happened last night.",
        "15": "I wrote it downÂ  I don't remember the question exactly.",
        "16": "Is Rio the type of guy that you have to get in his head or do you let him figure whatever it is out kind of through his own or in his own way?",
        "17": "He said that's kind of where it's goingÂ  He just said that out thereÂ  But at the same time he said that's got nothing to do with the summer, the contract, free agency, what might happen to him, what might happen around hereÂ  Do you believe that that isn't at least in some way playing some role with what's going on?",
        "18": "You guys have a mustâ€‘win game tomorrowÂ  Are you going to do any special preparation like yoga?",
        "19": "Before Game 1 in San Antonio I asked you about the factor of Micky Arison picking a team to come to years agoÂ  You said the first priority for you was playing with Chris and Dwyane, and then it was looking at Riley and SpoelstraÂ  When you evaluate your future, are you going to prioritize in that kind of order, who I can play with and then from there who is building the team, who is owning the team, et cetera?",
        "20": "In that vein, what defensive adjustments did you guys have to make?Ã‚Â  Or was that one of those games that you just got hot and you lived with it?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Oh, well, I mean, we have to fix some things for sure, but I'm not too concernedÂ  I believe in our system, believe in our teammates and we have to for sure play a better game than we did in Game 3Â  We learn from our mistakes and we have to bring a better approach or better physical mindset into Game 4.",
        "1": "Well, you hope notÂ  I don't believe soÂ  I believe we've played pretty good basketball throughout the postseason, so I don't believe they'll come backÂ  That was something we were going through the regular season and we've pretty much cleaned up.",
        "2": "It's pretty demanding, for sureÂ  He gets up under us and we've got to own our mistakes, and that's what it was all about.",
        "3": "No, I mean, a loss is a loss in the postseason, and a loss is a loss in the FinalsÂ  I mean, they're all painful no matter if you lose by 30 or you lose by 1Â  They're all painfulÂ  That's what it's about when you get to this point in the season.",
        "4": "Not that I can recallÂ  I've been a part of some really good shooting teams, playing against themÂ  But obviously, it's still fresh in my mindÂ  So not that I can recall.",
        "5": "It was a combination of both.",
        "6": "Well, I mean, we doÂ  He's been our starting point guard in our backâ€‘toâ€‘back championship runs and he played a key role in itÂ  And he can't lose confidence in himself. We can giveâ€‘â€‘ at the end of the day, you can give a guy as much confidence as you want, but when a guy loses confidence in himself, it can be all downhill, and that's one thing he can't doÂ  He can't lose confidence in himself or his abilities. We need him out on the floor to make playsÂ  He's our point guardÂ  He puts us in our sets and we need him to make shotsÂ  But more than anything, we need him just to demand being a point guard and being reliable offensively, being reliable defensively, and putting himself and our teammates in position to succeed, and that's what it's aboutÂ  You can't lose confidence in yourself more than anything.",
        "7": "No, you're not comfortableÂ  You never get comfortable in a playoff series everÂ  You're always on edge throughout the whole series until it's over, either with a win or a defeatÂ  So you're never comfortableÂ  You just try to learn from your mistakes that you made in the previous game, and not make the same ones the next game.",
        "8": "Well, Kawhi had a really impactful game last nightÂ  It started off with him going to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  That always helps you get a free throw or a layâ€‘up, and then he got a breakaway dunk and a transition three, and that kind of got him into the flow of things, so he kept it going. He's a really good talent, and he's a big piece of their puzzleÂ  So it's challenging, for sureÂ  But at this point, it should be.",
        "9": "Well, don't talk back to the coach is how it's ownedÂ  Let him make his point, whether he's right or wrong, and you live with it and move onÂ  That is the number one keyÂ  I've learned that over the years.",
        "10": "Yeah, I think soÂ  I think the game was getting out of controlÂ  We're trying to get in some driveâ€‘andâ€‘kicks for threes, things of that nature and it kind of got lostÂ  We hate when that happens because he's too big for our team for him to ever get lostÂ  He didn't miss a shot last night, but he didn't take manyÂ  He only took four shots and we can't allow that to happen for us to be successful. So I believe everybody was a little out of rhythm just because of the fact of how they jumped on us, and it was all scramble mode from that pointÂ  So we all have to do a better jobÂ  But not only seeing Chris, getting Rio, myself, everyone has to be in a good rhythm.",
        "11": "Quite a few years ago when you realize that it wouldn't change anythingÂ  You know, the coach is going to believe â€‘â€‘ you know, the coach is always rightÂ  It's like a teacher, they're always rightÂ  And that's fineÂ  That's fairÂ  They make the rules, and we've got to live by them.",
        "12": "Concerned with what?",
        "13": "I don't rememberÂ  What was the question?Ã‚Â  Concerned with some of ourâ€‘â€‘",
        "14": "Did I say that?",
        "15": "You don't remember the question?Ã‚Â  I think that was coming off Ira's question, him saying am I concerned about our bad habits we had in the regular seasonÂ  And I said I'm not too concerned about that because we played some good ball over the postseasonÂ  So that's different from am I concerned about us losing last night or losing another game. You're always on edge in the postseason, but I don't want to be concerned at this pointÂ  For us we have to make the adjustmentsÂ  We owned, like I said, what we had to do today in the film session and we'll come in with a better mindset tomorrowÂ  But that doesn't mean it results in a win, tooÂ  But we have to play with a little bit more focus and a little bit more challenge.",
        "16": "Obviously, it's weighing on himÂ  It's in his head right now, I thinkÂ  He hasn't said muchÂ  I don't know what he said to you guysÂ  I haven't heard many of his clipsÂ  Obviously, I don't read the clips, I don't hear themÂ  So his confidence may be a little shakenÂ  I'm not quite sure, but he can't lose confidence in himself. As a leader, I'm going to give him as much confidence as I can, and I'm going to stay on himÂ  Obviously, I've been aâ€‘â€‘ maybe I need to get back on him like I used to do in the past when you guys used to see me really get on himÂ  I've kind of laid off of himÂ  Maybe that wasn't the right thing to do. But he can't lose confidence in himselfÂ  That is the number one thing, and as teammates, we'll make sure we keep him up.",
        "17": "I mean, I would hope not, but I'm not Mario Chalmers and I'm not sure what goes through his mindÂ  I mean, this is the NBA Finals, but also it is his livelihood that he's playing for as well, you know, with him being a free agent this summerÂ  So I'm not quite sureÂ  All I can do as a leader of this team is try to maintain and let him know what the job is at handÂ  I understand that he's a point guard on a championship team and we need himÂ  We doÂ  I mean, he's been key for us throughout these runsÂ  But obviously right now he's been struggling a lotÂ  But the number one thing is he can't lose confidence in himselfÂ  Before we can give him confidence as a teammate, he has to believe in himself that he can make plays and just be out there and be reliable.",
        "18": "No, probably notÂ  I'll follow my same routineÂ  Get up for morning shootaround and start preparing in the afternoon and get back here and start preparing for the game. I don't plan on it unless something changes.",
        "19": "I don't know how I'll prioritize it this summer or in the futureÂ  That's kind of like on the back burner right now, me figuring out how I'm going to prioritize Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard and Duncan, and Danny Green and Ginobili, Patty Mills and Boris Diaw and Tiago Splitter, and the list goes on and on, Matt Bonner, Gregg Popovich, and Ime Udoka and those kind of guysÂ  That is the last thing I'm thinking about right nowÂ  Not prioritize me going into the future.",
        "20": "Some of it was mental breakdowns, and the mental breakdowns happened earlyÂ  Then it was an avalanche, and they started to get hotÂ  Against the Spurs, any little minor mistake you make they'll make you payÂ  And when you let them get in such a groove like they had last night, even when you are on top of things, once they got to the groove, there was no slowing them down.

        "0": "Lebron and Dwayne, was it a lack of effort defensively in the first half or execution?",
        "4": "Considering the stakes, is this about as frustrating of a loss you've had this season?",
        "5": "Was this one of those games where, was it the defense or where it was like, man, they're hitting everything?",
        "6": "LeBron, you were in such a great rhythm in Game 2Â  Really played well in Game 1Â  But tonight you committed a Finals record 7 turnoversÂ  How disappointed were you in your own performance?",
        "7": "And for a team that is now in its fourth Finals, how do you explain coming out with such a lack of urgency in a game at home?",
        "9": "You guys obviously probably don't expect Mario and Norris to have to match Tony and Patty MillsÂ  But what can you get from those guys to be more consistent in this series?Ã‚Â  What do you expect from that position?",
        "10": "LeBron, it seems like even when they're missing they're getting good, quality looksÂ  What is it about that offense that's so tough to defend?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Oh, they jumped on us, and they were the aggressor tonight, and they had us on our heels from the beginningÂ  This is something that at this point in the season shouldn't happen, but they were more aggressive an us and they got off to that 41â€‘25 lead at the end of the first.",
        "4": "Well, I mean, of courseÂ  I mean, it's The Finals, so everything is magnifiedÂ  You want to win at this point in the season but for us, we will get better from tonightÂ  We hate the performance that we put on, but it's 2â€‘1Â  It's not 4â€‘1Â  It's 2â€‘1, and we have to make some adjustments tomorrow. We're going to come in and learn from our mistakes, as we always do after a loss, and get ready and prepared from the beginningÂ  You know, this is the last team in the NBA that you can dig yourself a hole againstÂ  You just can't do it, and we learned from that tonight.",
        "5": "I think it was a little bit of everythingÂ  It was a cumulative of everythingÂ  Some possessions we played extremely well and they hit shotsÂ  Some possessions we weren't quite there and they hit shots as wellÂ  One thing about this team, if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay, and they made us pay more often than not tonight from some of the mistakes that we made defensively.",
        "6": "I was in a pretty good rhythm tonight as wellÂ  I just turned the ball over way too muchÂ  I had two at halftime, I had five in the second half, and some of them were trying to make some plays to my teammates, and some of them were just overdribbling at times. So I've got to do a better job with that for sureÂ  It's not surprising that I have a Finals record for something I don't want to have, you know, so there we goÂ  It's a new storyline for LeBron.",
        "7": "I don't think we had a lack of urgencyÂ  Just they were very aggressive and we didn't match thatÂ  They came in with a desperation that we just didn't match. Just because it's our fourth Finals doesn't mean anythingÂ  That doesn't guarantee you a winÂ  It doesn't guarantee you that you'll be more urgent or less urgent than the next teamÂ  You just have to prepare for each and every gameÂ  We've got to have a better performance in Game 4, for sureÂ  We definitely can't get behind this team like we did tonight.",
        "9": "Well, we want them to run the offense and we want them to defendÂ  When they get open looks, we want them to take them with confidenceÂ  When they have an opportunity, we want them to be aggressiveÂ  Obviously, with Tony and Patty, those guys are very high motors, so we want them to match that effort. One thing you can't control in the game of basketball if a shot goes in or not, but you can control how you defendÂ  You can control how much energy you bring to the game, how much effort you bring to the gameÂ  If our two point guards do that, we can be okay with thatÂ  I know our two point guards, they're very passionateÂ  They've got a lot of prideÂ  And I know they're looking forward to learning from what they did tonight, and trying to be much better in Game 4.",
        "10": "Well, they spread you outÂ  They have multiple guys that can make playsÂ  It's kind of like usÂ  They share the ball extremely well, and those guys are always in the right spotÂ  I mean, if they ran the set and closed their eyes, they know exactly where the guys going to be atÂ  It's a system they've been inÂ  They do a great job of feeling one another outÂ  And every guy that's on the floor can make a playÂ  You know, it's very challenging mentally and physically for a defenseÂ  So you always have to be in tune."

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, for all the heat that you've taken at times for the \"right basketball play\", how rewarding was it that C.B. knocked down that three?Ã‚Â  And how did you see that play develop?",
        "1": "LeBron, because you beat the Spurs in The Finals last year and won two in a row, do you think seeds of doubt creep into their minds, especially late in the game and in the fourth quarter?",
        "2": "What made you decide to take on the scoring duties in the third quarter and what made you not try to win it on your own in the fourth?",
        "3": "You dressed a little differently tonight than you did in Game No. 1Â  Can you talk about the decision process and how that affected you on the court?",
        "4": "How big did the basket look to you?Ã‚Â  You hadn't taken a jumpshot until the third quarterÂ  How big did the basket seem once you started putting that up?",
        "5": "LeBron, what got you going in the second quarter after your slow start in the first quarter?",
        "6": "After those two offensive rebounds in the second quarter how physically drained were you?Ã‚Â  It looked like you asked to come out of the game.",
        "7": "LeBron, after what you were dealing with the last 48 hours, at what point in the game did you know that your legs were there for you and were going to respond?Ã‚Â  And did you do anything else differently to try to make sure you could get through this game?",
        "8": "I assume that was not hot yoga.",
        "9": "When you were able to come out of the game tonight, how did it feel to have air conditioning?",
        "10": "You dominated from the perimeter in the second half. Ã‚Â Was that an adjustment you made at halftime from what you saw or did you just take what the defense gave you essentially?",
        "11": "In the last couple of days have you had any fans send any remedies, things to avoid cramps, things of that nature?",
        "12": "After Tim and Tony missed those four free throws, you score five straight. Ã‚Â In a situation like that when a team misses an opportunity, do you smell blood a little bit there?Ã‚Â  What were you thinking?",
        "13": "You talked the other day about how scrutinized you are and living in this fishbowl that you've lived in for a long timeÂ  What has helped you cope with that, deal with that and live with this altered reality that you have?",
        "14": "A lot of your teammates said they have had to learn just not to care what's said about them or criticism or anything like thatÂ  Do you also have to push all that to the side?",
        "15": "Can you just talk about how big Rashard Lewis was for you guys tonightÂ  He's a player that hasn't played a lot of minutes this season but he's been stepping up big for you guys.",
        "16": "Talk about the importance of keeping them out of the paint down the stretch of the game, not only tonight but for the games going forward.",
        "17": "What has to continue as a whole offensively and defensively so you can have more success the rest of the way?",
        "18": "LeBron, Chris missed the corner three on the shot before he made oneÂ  Do you ever let stuff like that influence your decision and why or why not?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It was rewarding in that it was a huge play to help us winÂ  I just seen it develop the whole time, and I wanted to try to put some pressure towards the rim, and I caught Tim Duncan peeking at me a little bitÂ  And I was able to find C.B. in the corner in one of his favorite spots on the floor and he knocked it down.",
        "1": "That's not our concernÂ  All we worry about is what we can control and that's just how we play the game, how we approach the game both physically and mentallyÂ  And we live with the results.",
        "2": "Just play the game, try to play the game the right wayÂ  However the flow of the game is going, I just try to impose my will in some kind of way, either scoring or rebounding or assisting or defendingÂ  Put myself and my teammates in a position to succeed, and I was happy in the fact that I was able to make some plays to help us get the victory tonight.",
        "3": "Didn't affect me at allÂ  I've been going with the longer tights throughout the playoffs; decided to go with the shorter ones todayÂ  I don't know, I was watching Game 2 of our Finals appearance versus OKC in 2012, and I didn't have long tights on in that game, so that's why I didn't wear them tonightÂ  Just a little crazy on my part.",
        "4": "For me once I get into a good groove, I feel like everything is going to go inÂ  Obviously it didn'tÂ  I made a couple of shots in a row, and then missed the elbow jumpshot over Tim, and they made a run after that. But for me I just try to make plays out there on the floor, and like I continue to say, put myself and my teammates in a position to succeed and live with the results after that.",
        "5": "I just continued to attackÂ  I had a slow start, but all my misses was in the paintÂ  My first miss was a shot over Tim and Tiago; I missed itÂ  I missed a spinning layup in the laneÂ  I missed a banker over Tony ParkerÂ  I just got off to a slow startÂ  Then I drove the lane and got my foot tangled up a little bit and threw up a wild shot I started 1â€‘forâ€‘5Â  I was confident in where I was getting on the floor and I had to stick with it.",
        "6": "For me, at that point in the game, yeah, I was tiredÂ  I got two offensive reboundsÂ  Was able to go back up with themÂ  Put some pressure on their defenseÂ  So Spo was very, very consistent and great with his adjustments today as far as the personnel, in and out guys, in and outÂ  And when I asked to come out, he took me out and I was able to go back in.",
        "7": "You know, I didn't really try to think about it too muchÂ  One thing I did do differently this morning, I took an 8 a.m. yoga class at our resort that we stayed at outsideÂ  Me, and three other people and also a little kid but he didn't want no parts of itÂ  So that's probably the only thing that I did differently today.",
        "8": "Nah, it started to rain a little bit this morning, actuallyÂ  About 8:35 it started to rain.",
        "9": "Well, I mean, mentally I didn't want to even think about it too muchÂ  What happened on Thursday was ThursdayÂ  My whole focus was how was it going to help this team even the series up and just try to make some plays.",
        "10": "It wasn't an adjustmentÂ  In the first half, you know, I got into the paint, made some shots, got some rebounds, put pressure on their defenseÂ  In the second half they backed up off me and I shot it. It was that easy for me in the sense of don't overthink itÂ  They give me space, I shoot itÂ  They get up on me, I try to drive and make plays for me and my teammatesÂ  They're going to make adjustments going into Game 3, and I have to do it as wellÂ  But I don't want to cloud my mind too much with what they're doing defensivelyÂ  I want their defense to react to what I'm doing.",
        "11": "I've heard it allÂ  I've heard it allÂ  I just stay with my planÂ  Our training staff and our medical team, we do a great job of just doing what we usually do. Ã‚Â We didn't want to complicate thingsÂ  I think the two and a half bags after a game of IV helped me out a lotÂ  Like I said, I didn't try to think about it too much tonight.",
        "12": "I thought it was a tough call to start it off, with Rio getting the flagrant oneÂ  I thought it was an inadvertent elbowÂ  I didn't think it was intentionalÂ  So Tony missed two and Tim went up and missed two as wellÂ  Just wanted to capitalize off their mistakes and just try to put some pressure on their defense. We got some great looks, we made 'em tonightÂ  And the biggest thing for us, we got stops as well when we needed itÂ  That helped us win this game.",
        "13": "I've got a great supporting cast around me that allows me to vent at timesÂ  Try not to hold it inÂ  I also understand at this point in my life what's important and what's not important and what's important is my teammates, what's important is my two kids at home, my wife, my family and my friendsÂ  That's what I can control and that's what's important to me. Obviously the game of basketball has brought me so much, and I love to play this game at a high levelÂ  And without this game, I wouldn't be who I am todayÂ  But I also know what's importantÂ  Everything else kind of just fall by the wayside.",
        "14": "You have toÂ  It's very difficult at times, very challenging, but for me, I'm here and I know who I'm playing for and what I'm playing for and what I stand for, not only as a basketball player but as man and as a role modelÂ  I know what I stand for. To be able to put an NBA uniform on every single night with my name on the back, knowing where I come from, let's me know that I've done something specialÂ  I just try to give back to the game as much as I can while I'm here.",
        "15": "Rashard has been huge for us ever since he's been inserted into our starting lineup, from the Indiana series. He's been in this position beforeÂ  He's been to the Finals with Orlando MagicÂ  He's been in huge playoff games, and his experience and ability to knock down shots helps us out a lotÂ  It spreads the floor for us, and every time he catches the ball, we tell him just to shoot itÂ  Don't think about nothing else besides shooting the ball, and we live with his results.",
        "16": "I think that's a key going into any gameÂ  When a team lives in the paint, it puts so much pressure on your defense and it allows paint points obviouslyÂ  But when guys get into the paint it shrinks the defense, and they get to kick out for their threes, which they did a couple times tonightÂ  Danny Green had one, Tony hit one, Patty Mills had a coupleÂ  We got to do a better job of shrinking the floor and not allowing them to get in the paint. They will, they will get into the paint some, but as much as we can limit the penetration, it will help us out a lot.",
        "17": "Offensively we want to share the ball and not turn the ball overÂ  We're a team that shoots the ball extremely high from the field, very efficient offensivelyÂ  We get ourselves in trouble when we turn the ball overÂ  It doesn't allow us to set our defenseÂ  We're a really good halfâ€‘court defense, we're a solid pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll defenseÂ  And when we're solid offensively, we don't turn the ball over, we're going to get an opportunity to make something happen.",
        "18": "Not at allÂ  If you're on the floor at that point in time, you can make a playÂ  You can make a shot, a steal, a reboundÂ  You can do whatever it takes to help us winÂ  For me, when the ball is in my hands, I'm going to make the right playÂ  To have that trust from my teammates, they know when I got the ball, I'm going to make the right playÂ  Doesn't mean it's going to go inÂ  Doesn't mean it's going to result in a win, but they believe in my ability to do that. You know, C.B. had just missed one, got a great look, but if I draw two and his man leave him again, I went right back to him and he knocked it downÂ  I got a lot of confidence in my teammates and they got a lot of confidence in me and we live with the results no matter what happens.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, do you use today as a day to challenge and kind of test your body after the last game or do you need another day of rest, and we'll just wait to Game 2 to test yourself?",
        "1": "What is your maintenance now consistent of?",
        "2": "Bike, cardio?",
        "3": "You've had a lot of looks at the Spurs defense in the playoffs over the yearsÂ  What is it about their defense that makes it difficult for individuals to put up a lot of points on them?",
        "4": "The TV cameras caught you before Game 1 saying every game has got to be Game 7Â  I know your approach often doesn't change bought how taxing is it mentally to keep going to that Game 7 well, particularly with this opponent and these stakes?",
        "5": "Dwyane said yesterday he thinks going longer in the rotation, Spo using more guys would have helped obviouslyÂ  With Rio's foul trouble that may have broke things off a little bitÂ  Do you anticipate going nine tomorrow?",
        "6": "LeBron, you guys have won your last 12 games after a loss in the playoffsÂ  Can you take us inside the locker room?Ã‚Â  What changes with you guys coming off a loss?Ã‚Â  How is it different?Ã‚Â  And how have you been able to be so resilient in that situation?",
        "7": "LeBron, what's your definition of high basketball IQ?Ã‚Â  And with everything that goes through your mind, how do you manage it so that you don't overthink it?",
        "8": "Have you managed it better over the past few seasons?",
        "9": "LeBron, yesterday you called yourself the easiest target in sportsÂ  You're a twoâ€‘time champion, a fourâ€‘time MVPÂ  Why do you think that is?",
        "10": "Why do you think that is?",
        "11": "LeBron, Game 1 in the fourth quarter, Danny Green caught fire after struggling the first three quartersÂ  You guys saw what he can do in The Finals last yearÂ  What do you need to do to make sure he doesn't get behind the arc?",
        "12": "Boris Diaw made a good job of contesting your shots last season in The Finals in Game 1Â  How important of a matchâ€‘up is it for you personally?",
        "13": "Talking a little bit about the mental approach after you had your body not do what you want it to in a big game, then you go into the next big gameÂ  You mentioned earlier you don't want to run the tank out but you want to go all outÂ  What's the complicated balance of the mental approach when you're trying to figure out what your body can do and you know it's so important?",
        "14": "Is there any danger of getting distracted at all by, how am I feeling right now?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, I'm going to get some work done today, but there is no way to test my body for what I went throughÂ  The conditions are nowhere near extreme as they was, unless I decide to run from here to the hotel, that's the only way I would be able to test my body out. But I'm doing well, doing a lot betterÂ  The soreness is starting to get outÂ  I'm feeling better than I did yesterday and with another day, I should feel much better tomorrow.",
        "1": "A lot of treatment, icing, stretching, obviously I'm going to get some cardio in today, get the heart rate goingÂ  A lot of fluids, kind of get my body above the curve.",
        "2": "Bike and running.",
        "3": "I think Tim Duncan is very goodÂ  Probably one of the best at protecting the rimÂ  So they're able to funnel a lot of things to himÂ  He's able to protect the rimÂ  In that sense, very, very smart guy. I also think the length that they have had at the wing position helps out as wellÂ  Very active with their hands. Ã‚Â They kind ofâ€‘â€‘ they want to bait you into taking lowâ€‘percentage shots, and that's the contested twoâ€‘point shotÂ  Layups and threeâ€‘point shots in our league is the number one and two, whatever team you have, as far as the most dangerousÂ  So they kind of try to bait you into taking shots that maybe out your team's comfort zone.",
        "4": "It can be taxing but at the end of the day, it is what it is at this pointÂ  Two weeks left in the season, then we all can go restÂ  Unless some of you guys go off and do baseball or football, whatever the case may be. So you have to try to put your mind at mindset and for me I did at Game 1, and for me the tank was empty and I used the reserve tank until my body couldn't go no moreÂ  I'm going to try to do the same thing on TuesdayÂ  Obviously I don't want to go too far running my tank outÂ  I want to be able to finish the game but you have to have that mindset, there is no tomorrowÂ  But it's challenging, but for a championship you don't want it easy.",
        "5": "Every game is differentÂ  Obviously we could have used that in Game 1Â  I thought at times maybe Toney, J.J., U.D. could have gotten some minutesÂ  Take the load off some of us, but each game is differentÂ  Spo is going to coach the game the way he sees the game going and flowing and we definitely going to ride with that, the way he calls the game. And like I said, Thursday's game was extreme measuresÂ  And I don't expect that tomorrow night, but we'll see.",
        "6": "I just think experienceÂ  We have experienced it enoughÂ  Obviously we don't like experience in losses but it happensÂ  We're able to bounce back, go to the film room, take account and not just bypass the mistakes we had in the previous gameÂ  And I think it's allowed us to move on and better ourselves for the next game.",
        "7": "Well, that's the challenge, that's the biggest challenge, having a high basketball IQ because you play so many different situations in your head and so many differentâ€‘â€‘ I don't know, throughout the game that sometimes it could get into what's really importantÂ  And that's just sometimes going out and letting the game flow and just playing. But I think me having a high basketball IQ and I've been told this, that it's allowed me to see things before they happen, put guys in position, kind of read my teammates, knowing who is out of rhythm, who is in rhythm, knowing the score, the time, who has it going on the other end, knowing their likes and dislikes and being able to calibrate all that into a game situationÂ  That's very challenging, but it comes natural, and when you know you have that, it helps your team out a lot.",
        "8": "Well, it's grown more and more and more because I've experienced more. I've continued to be able to play in meaningful games every year, so that's helped outÂ  I've been able to be around a great group of guys that's helped out, that allowed me to lead themÂ  They trust my leadership, and basketball IQ comes into that leadershipÂ  It's helped out a lot having a group of guys that allow me to do it.",
        "9": "I don't think it, I know it.",
        "10": "I just amÂ  I don't knowÂ  Because I've been in front of the camera and the camera has been in front of me since I was 15 years oldÂ  You guys have seen everything from me, from being an adolescent kid just playing the game of basketball because he loves it as a hobby, to now playing as a professional, to succeeding, going to the top, to falling off the mountain, to going up to the top againÂ  You guys have seen everything that my life has had to offer since I was a 15â€‘yearâ€‘old kidÂ  I don't know if Brian Windhorst is in here somewhere, is he?Ã‚Â  He could tell you my life story almost better than my mother could (Laughter.) So I think that has a lot to do with itÂ  Half of my life I've been in front of this, so it makes me an easy target.",
        "11": "We just got at that keep our eye on him, we gave him no space last year, every time he caught the ball, he had a guy in his face and he had a guy run him offÂ  The three threes he made in the first quarter, one was off a driveâ€‘andâ€‘kick where he got the ball wide openÂ  The other one was a baseline driveâ€‘andâ€‘kick from Boris Diaw, where he swung the ball over to the wing and made a threeÂ  And the last was off an outâ€‘ofâ€‘bounds play where they set us upÂ  He set a cross screen for Diaw and Tim Duncanpinned down on him, and he was able to get a three with no contest. A guy like that you can't take an eye off of, you can't take a body off of and take account of where he is outside that threeâ€‘point line.",
        "12": "This series is not going to be defined by the LeBronâ€‘versusâ€‘Diaw matchâ€‘upÂ  It's the Spurs versus the HeatÂ  Whatever team makes the correct matchâ€‘up, the adjustments from game to game will win the series.",
        "13": "Well, for me and the situation that happened in Game 1 is like you don't know it's going to happenÂ  Obviously I felt the extreme measures, but I wasn't the only one out there on the floorÂ  So you just play and you worry about the results laterÂ  You can't think about what may happen in the third or fourth quarter, live in the momentÂ  And for me, whatever I can give my teammates if it happens again, hopefully I can make an impact while I'm on the floor and that's all that matters to me. I can live with the resultsÂ  If I'm giving my all and playing as hard as I can, I'm putting my body and my mind on the line for us to win, you know, for that guy back there in the back, it's all that matters.",
        "14": "No, they won't distract me. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  Ready to go to practice so we can get better, bro?Ã‚Â  You been talking all day, let's go! LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  Practice?Ã‚Â  Not the game!Ã‚Â  You talking about practice?Ã‚Â  All rightÂ  I gotta get to practice. THE MODERATOR:Ã‚Â  Thank you FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "Can you take us through how much you had to go through the last 12 hours and what your pain and stiffness level is right now?",
        "1": "LeBron, the county official that oversees the AT&T Center, he was at the game last night and he said that he thought media reports of the conditions were overstated; that he was actually comfortableÂ  Put in your words what you thought",
        "2": "Can you take us through what you did during the game, how you tried to deal with the heat and when you first started to notice it was affecting your body?",
        "3": "Do you make anything of social media criticism, the chatter, Jonathan Martin, the Gatorade?",
        "4": "When you made your last layup, did everything just clenched up right then?",
        "5": "LeBron, how much anger did you experience last night about not being able to be out there at the end?",
        "6": "Will you continue to get IVs?Ã‚Â  Are you finished for treatment?",
        "7": "Was there a time where you felt like you should have overridden Spo's decision, or was it just impossible to go last night?",
        "8": "LeBron, you may have just answered this, but have doctors ever told you why you may be more susceptible to cramping and why it happens to you?",
        "9": "You've obviously been educated on the science behind all this since you've been dealing with it since high school, but what exactly is the cause?Ã‚Â  Because everyone says hydrate more, drink more water, you've been taking pills or salt tabletsÂ  What seems to help?",
        "10": "The whole Sterling saga you spoke out very forcefully and early on thatÂ  Just wondering, what is it that makes you so comfortable also speaking out aboutâ€‘â€‘ willing to voice your opinion on other social issues and things that may be further away from the basketball court?",
        "11": "Is that something that four or five years ago you wouldn't have felt as comfortable speaking on?",
        "12": "What do you guys feel like you have to do better in Game 2 than last night?",
        "13": "Last night, do you sometimes feel constrained by the requirements of the products that you endorse, whether it's hydration products or some of the gear you wear?Ã‚Â  And that gear, the compression stuff, the body armor, you wear a lot of that stuffÂ  How essential is it and do you feel like it caused you to retain heat and made things worse?",
        "14": "What about the first part, the drinks versus the endorsementsÂ  Do you feel like you have to stick with the products that you're endorsing or do you feel like you can venture out and do other stuff?",
        "15": "Is there any question about your availability on Sunday?Ã‚Â  And how far from 100% are you today?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I'm pretty sore right now just from the muscles spasming up and they're starting to release, but I'm pretty sore in my legsÂ  What I went through the last twelve hours was getting up and using the restroom a lotÂ  I got two and a half bags of IV last night right after the gameÂ  So between 2 a.m. and 11 a.m. I got up about six or seven timesÂ  So obviously I got no sleep.",
        "1": "How do I answer this?Ã‚Â  They were some extreme conditionsÂ  I've never played an NBA game like it was last night as far as the heatÂ  Not an excuse but it was an extreme conditionÂ  I looked at the stands at one point and I saw every last fan having fans, double entendre, waving fans and I knew at that point, this is something different.",
        "2": "I always hydrateÂ  Every time I'm out I'm hydrating every timeout, because I know I sweat a lotÂ  But I noticed it in warmâ€‘ups, and I don't know where it came from, but I felt it get a little warmÂ  And I actually sat on the scorer's table for 10 minutes and stopped warming up, so I could cool down a little bit. I really started to feel it in the second quarter and I never really change my uniform, but at halftime I changed my whole uniform and in the third quarter I came out with I believe eight minutes to go in the thirdÂ  And I usually play the whole third quarter, so I knew the conditions was a little extreme for me personally.",
        "3": "I'm not on social media right now, obviously I hear about it, because I know you guys are going to ask me, so I need to be ready for itÂ  The medical team we have here, man, my training staff and myself we do a great job of preparing for a game. What everybody has to say, you guys should know me by now; I don't care, I really don'tÂ  I really don't care what people say about me, I don't care about that sports group, the drink group thatâ€‘â€‘ I'm not even going to say their nameÂ  I'm not going to give them a lightÃ‚Â  in The FinalsÂ  This is about the Spurs and the Heat, and it's not about everybody else, man, I don't care.",
        "4": "Yeah, just shut downÂ  My body just shut down, basically my body said, okay, enough jumping for you for the nightÂ  You've had enoughÂ  Nothing I could do about it.",
        "5": "For obvious reasons, I was angry, I was disappointed in myselfÂ  I mean, I did everything that I needed to do to prepare for this game, prepare for this moment and, you know, to feel like my body failed me last night, I was angry in the fact that I couldn't help my team get over the humpÂ  In a huge Game 1, wanting to make a statementÂ  After I made that layup, we was down two. So disappointed in myself, angry at myself that I couldn't be out there where I knew my team needed me the mostÂ  That was frustrating for sure.",
        "6": "I'm not done with treatment, but I'm probably done with the IVs right now, unless I catch a cramp sitting around the hotel or tomorrow at practice or something like thatÂ  I've been very preventativeÂ  This happened to me a few timesÂ  Happened to me a lot in high schoolÂ  I have been tested for it; all the tests came back positiveÂ  So we're always up on it, and stay ahead of the curve, and last night was one of those nights.",
        "7": "No, Spo knows the best for our teamÂ  He has the best interest for our teamÂ  And I did want to go back in the game, and he was like, \"Hey, don't even try itÂ  It's a long series.\"Ã‚Â  And I respected thatÂ  I could have gotten myself into more troubleÂ  You know, if I go out there and try to play through a cramp and pull something, it could be even worse. I left it at that time and went in and got my treatment, got my IVs and just prepared for Game 2.",
        "8": "No, no, they haven'tÂ  I've been tested and all the results came back positive, they said just keen doing what you been doing, continue to hydrateÂ  Continue to do everything you've been doingÂ  It hasn't happened a lot in my careerÂ  It's just so happened it happened twice in the NBA Finals and we all remember thatÂ  It happened in the OKC series and it happened last night. So bad timing on my part, you know, and hopefully it doesn't happen again.",
        "9": "The body just decides to shut downÂ  I mean, I hydrated as much as I could to the point where your stomach feels like it just can't take anymoreÂ  Last night it just got to a point where the body just had enough, just dehydratedÂ  Between jumping and running and cutting and sweating and a little bit of everything, exhaustion, you know, the body just hit the shutdownÂ  Nothing that you can do about it, in my caseÂ  You know, it's frustrating for sure, but nothing I can do about it.",
        "10": "For me I voice my opinion on issues that first of all, I have knowledge about and issues that I feel like I'm able to make an impact on, things that I'm comfortable withÂ  And two instances in cases was obviously the Donald Sterling piece, because I'm part of this league and I want this league to stand for the right thing, me being a part of itÂ  It should beâ€‘â€‘ this league should stand for the game, being the greatest sport the world has to offer, the greatest athletes, the greatest owners, the greatest coaches and so on and so on, the greatest fansÂ  And I spoke on the Trayvon Martin piece and it hit home for me because I have two young boys at homeÂ  And I couldn't imagine sending my boys off, and not seeing them again. So those are two issues that were easy for me to speak on while everybody else believed it was sensitive.",
        "11": "Four or five years ago, I don't knowÂ  I don't knowÂ  Could have been the caseÂ  Maybe I felt like I wasn't mature enough to speak on it, didn't have enough knowledge to speak on itÂ  When you become more comfortable with yourself, you start to feel like you can do other things as wellÂ  And for me, I speak on issues that I believe is either right or wrong and go from there.",
        "12": "We got to defend the paint a little bit betterÂ  They did a great job of moving us around and through the pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls they got buckets in the paint. We can't turn the ball over on the road. We did a great job of covering the three but loosened up a little bit in the fourth, and it was five out of six from the threeâ€‘point lineÂ  Danny had two or three, Kawhi had two and Tony had oneÂ  From our quarter so that would be six, so we've got to do a better job of getting out to their shooters as well, but we will break down the film, and I'll give you a more extensive answer tomorrow.",
        "13": "I actually don't wear a lot of it, I wear a pair of tights, underwear, jersey and shorts, socks and shoes and a headband, arm sleeveÂ  (Laughter)Â  Compared to my teammate Dâ€‘Wade, he looks like a football player compared to me. I don't really wear a bunch of stuffÂ  Like I said, we're on top of it, between the training staff and the medical staff we have here and myself, I'll be on top of Ã‚Â itÂ  It's a freak thing, I don't know, when it happens, there is nothing I can do about it, except get hydrated and go from there.",
        "14": "Listen, at the end of the day I'm here to win a championship, you know, and obviously I'm conscious about the things that I endorse, but that's not in the forefront of my mind when I'm trying to win a championshipÂ  Whatever it takes for us to win at this point that's what I'm going to doÂ  Me being out on the floor, helping our team win throughout crucial moments is more important than anything.",
        "15": "If I had to say today I would probably be out on Sunday, I probably won't playÂ  (Laughter.) No, I'll be all rightÂ  I'll be in uniform on SundayÂ  I should be 100% on SundayÂ  Obviously I'm going to take it light todayÂ  Training staff said I should take it light todayÂ  Give the body another day to recover, tomorrow I should be back on my feet full go, and I got all day Sunday to get ready for Sunday nightÂ  Don't worry, you guys can talk about me as much as you wantÂ  I'll be there on Sunday as wellÂ  I'm not hiding.

        "1": "You were going to try to give it a go?",
        "2": "Is it just frustration?Ã‚Â  Is it anger?",
        "3": "You tried to move, just saw the legs buckle on the baseline, how much pain were you in?",
        "4": "Was it just the left leg or was there more?",
        "5": "What did you try and do at halftime?Ã‚Â  Did you have any idea how much fluid you tried to get in you?",
        "6": "You have nearly three full days now before you have to play again, how thankful are you that you have the extra day in between?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I'm feeling better than I did when I came off the floorÂ  So, doing better.",
        "1": "I was going to try to give it a go and Spo said noÂ  It sucks at this point in time in the seasonÂ  You know, after I made that layup we was down two and, you know, as well as they played we still had a chanceÂ  You know, after I came out of the game, they kinda took offÂ  And it was frustrating sitting out and not be able to help our team.",
        "2": "Yeah, it's bothÂ  I mean, it's frustration and anger, but at the same time it's something that you try to prevent, you try to controlÂ  I mean, I got all the fluids I need to get, I do my normal routine I've done and it was inevitable for me tonight, throughout the conditions, you know, out there on the floorÂ  I lost all the fluids that I was putting in in the last couple of days out there on the floor. It sucks not being out there for your team, especially at this point in the season.",
        "3": "The best option for me to do was not to moveÂ  I tried and any little step or nudge, it would get worseÂ  It would lock up worse and my muscles spasmed 10 out of 10Â  Best thing for me to do was just not to move, and, you know, it was frustrating.",
        "4": "Well, no, it was the whole left leg, damn near the whole left sideÂ  I was losing a lot throughout the gameÂ  It was extremely hot in the building, you know, both teams, fans, everybody could feel itÂ  I was the one that had to take the shot.",
        "5": "Drank a lot at halftime, even changed my uniform, just tried to get the sweat up off of youÂ  Our training staff tried to do the best they could by giving us ice bags and cold towels on timeouts, keep us dry. It was an unusual circumstance, I never played in a building like that, it's been a while, like high school game or CYO and everybody is sitting on top and you feel good being in a building like that. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's no discredit for what they didÂ  They played extremely wellÂ  They moved the ball extremely wellÂ  I think they had 30 assistsÂ  You know, even from the turnovers both teams were committing, uncharacteristic of both teams, they played extremely well.",
        "6": "I need it, I need it, I need itÂ  We're going to start tonight, continue to get the fluids in me and get me ready for SundayÂ  Thankful for the fact that I can get on it tonight, and put myself in a position where I can be out there for my team for the long haulÂ  And sitting on the sideline, you know, if I'm not in foul trouble, is not good for us and not good for meÂ  Look forward to Game 2 and go from there FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LJ, you talked yesterday about how you don't need any more motivation but being back here playing in Junesurrounded by Finals signage, all those things, how can you avoid there not being more motivation right now?Ã‚Â  And what affect is it having on you?",
        "1": "Just to follow up, if it is your fifth time here, how do you keep that feeling new?Ã‚Â  How do you keep saying, you feel blessedÂ  I don't want to say it gets old but this is your fifth time in eight yearsÂ  How does that feeling stay the same as it felt in '07?",
        "2": "LeBron, when you guys played Spain in the Olympics the first time it was such a good game, people wanted to see it again, and the second time it was just as good and a lot of people feel the same about this seriesÂ  Do you think that's possible?Ã‚Â  And do you ever say, \"It would be cool to play them again,\" or whoever is in front of you is in front of you?",
        "3": "LeBron, have you had any conversation with Magic or Jordan or anybody where they put into perspective what it means to have all these Finals appearances?",
        "4": "How much have you changed as a player and person since that Dallas Finals?",
        "5": "LeBron, you have a chance to win your third straight title and knowing how few people have been able to do that, what do you think it would mean for your legacy?Ã‚Â  And also how much respect do you have for Tim Duncan the fact that he's been able to keep a franchise relevant for 15 years?",
        "6": "LeBron, I think you were in 8th grade when Tim won his first championship, in '99.",
        "7": "So something like thatÂ  Do you remember any of that?Ã‚Â  I know you have a photographic memory for past thingsÂ  Do you remember it?Ã‚Â  Did you have any observations of Tim at the time?",
        "8": "I know you've talked about how long you want to play and eventually there will come a time where you may not be able to play at the level you want, but could you see yourself changing your game in the way that Tim has changed it as he's gone through the years or do you feel like he hasn't changed it all that much?",
        "9": "LeBron, sometimes you hear the people say the Spurs gave it away last year, they should have won it last yearÂ  Do you guys ever slighted when you hear stuff like that?",
        "10": "They're motivated by last yearÂ  Are you guys motivated by that at all, too, to be a little more definitive?Ã‚Â  I'm sure you will take it however you get it.",
        "11": "LeBron, last week Frank Vogel called you the Michael Jordan of this eraÂ  Can you talk about what that meant to you?Ã‚Â  And what it makes you feel about winning this third title in a row?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Tim, I'm blessed, manÂ  That's all I can sayÂ  This is my fifth appearance in a FinalsÂ  I'm blessedÂ  I was a kid who watched so many Finals appearances and, you know, watched Michael Jordan and watched Shaq and Kobe, is and we watched throwâ€‘back Finals games of Magic and Bird and Isiah and Hakeem in The FinalsÂ  I just wished maybe I could see the Finals verbiage behind me and be a part of this. Like I said, I don't need extra motivationÂ  This is motivating enoughÂ  I'm extremely blessed.",
        "1": "Because for me I just live in the momentÂ  I live in the momentÂ  It's an exciting time for not only myself but for my friends, my family, for my city, where I'm fromÂ  Every time I come up here and talk to you guys or I do something, you know, very well on the basketball floor or off the floor, my city is rewarded by thatÂ  So my family is rewarded by that, my friends are rewarded by that. You know, the kids and all the kids in the world that look up to me are rewarded by thatÂ  That's enough to get me byÂ  Everything else is extra credit.",
        "2": "You hope it's going to be a great series for both teams' sake, for the fans that love our gameÂ  You hope it can be one of the great Finals appearances. As far as seeing 'em again, I think both teams will say it doesn't matter, you just hope that you get back and be able to put yourself in a position to do it again, win, lose or draw, you want to put yourself in a position where you can try to win oneÂ  We're excited about this opportunity to represent the Eastern Conference and we look forward to it.",
        "3": "No, no, I never had any conversation with anybody about what it takes to get to this pointÂ  I think I can relive one conversation that I had with Jerry West and with IsiahÂ  I talked to them after I lost in The Finals my first year in Miami and asked them questions about what it took to get over the humpÂ  Obviously, I don't know if you guys know the story of Jerry West, the multiple times that it took for him to get over the hump and also Isiah, and they gave me some great pointers, that I like to keep in my Rolodex, until I decide to write a book when I'm doneÂ  But those guys were very helpful. But for me my role has been kind of walk by myself and learning from experienceÂ  You know, even though I've got so many great words from Isiah and Jerry West you can only live in your own life and on your own path and make your own course, and I've been fortunate enough to do that.",
        "4": "More than a player, I grew as manÂ  I have a beautiful familyÂ  I'm a father to two, you knowÂ  I grew even more as man both on and off the floor and I think that's what helped my gameÂ  I understood that I needed to become better after that Finals appearance, and I took onus to itÂ  I went back to the basics, on every aspect and every sense of the word and up to this point to today.",
        "5": "To answer the first question, to just be in this position to be able to win a third straight, it's a blessingÂ  I couldn't ask for moreÂ  This is an opportunity for me to do what I always wanted to do and that's to continue to win championships, that's what I'm here for. My legacy will speak for itself after I'm done playing the game of basketball, something I can't controlÂ  I worry about what I can control and that's how I approach the game on and off the floor, every single day. As far as Tim Duncan I think he's one of the greatest to ever play our gameÂ  He is still solidifying his legacy at this point, just because in the sense that he's playing at the one of the highest levels of any guy that's played this longÂ  To keep this team and this franchise relevant over 15 years is amazingÂ  To see what he does on the floor every single night and year after year people count him out and count this franchise out, because of this whole old epidemic that we have in sports, just let's you know what type of person and what type of player and passion he has for the game.",
        "6": "Yeah, I was a freshman in high school.",
        "7": "I thought it was weird because it wasn't a full NBA season, and I had gotten used to watching full NBA seasonsÂ  And that's what I started toâ€‘â€‘ I love the game, but that's when I really started to get serious with itÂ  So to see, you know, Tim Duncan out there and David Robinson, it was like, win one for David RobinsonÂ  But Tim Duncan was definitely the premiere player out there on the floor and I think it was huge. I think it was great when you can as a kid, you watch somebody celebrate and win a championship, you hope that you can put yourself in their shoesÂ  Not knowing that I would face him in The Finals years later or evenâ€‘â€‘ this is my third time facing him, so I think it's pretty cool.",
        "8": "I canÂ  When Timmy D first started they were more of an insideâ€‘out teamÂ  I think our league was more insideâ€‘outÂ  You would work the ball in the post and if you were doubled, you would kick it out and it was a repost, and they had the team to do it David and TimmyÂ  I think our league has transformed into a pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll team, an outsideâ€‘in and if you have the luxury of being able to throw it down in the post, it's like an extra bonusÂ  For them they have a Hall of Famer to be able to throw it down to when games can get erratic with pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll and spread offenses. I've changed my game since I've got to Miami in the sense that I was probably 75â€‘85% pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls in Cleveland and after that it was isolationÂ  Now I'm a third of pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsâ€‘â€‘ no, I would say 40% postâ€‘ups, 40% pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls, and not even as much isosÂ  I would sprinkle it in, and I've changed my game since then and I will change my gameÂ  You have toÂ  Father Time is undefeated. So me high flying and doing the things that I'm able to do now at 29Â  At 36 maybe I wouldn't be able to do itÂ  I will change my game again, if I want to continue to be helpful to a team.",
        "9": "AbsolutelyÂ  I can't sit here and lie to you, Chris, we doÂ  We feel slighted in the fact that the gameâ€‘â€‘ it went sevenÂ  It went sevenÂ  It wasn't like it was 3â€‘0 and, you know, they had us in Game 4 and we took it and won four straight. If you look at the numbers, look at the numbers, the lead changes, the ties and the points in that series, it's almost evenÂ  I don't know the numbers exactly but I know they're very, very, very close from the lead changes to the ties, and to the points. So we did our part, they did their partÂ  Both teams put themselves in a position to win an NBA Championship, and we just happened to make one or two more plays to win itÂ  But at the end of the day it doesn't take away that we did win last year, but that's last yearÂ  Last year is last year and we're excited about it, but this trophy this year belongs to nobodyÂ  It's up for grabs.",
        "10": "They are motivatedÂ  I think motivation can only go so farÂ  How much motivation can carry you to a championship, I'm not sureÂ  At the end of the day, five, ten guys on the floor, three refs and one basketballÂ  You gotta make playsÂ  I can't shoot the ball and say motivation will make it inÂ  I can't sit in the lane and take a charge and say, motivation, let me get this call. Motivation, yes, can carry you to some things, I agree, because I had it a lot after we lost in 2011 to the Mavericks, but at the end of the day you have to play the game of basketball and do it the right way and hopefully, you know, you can sit back and say, well, I did everything it took to winÂ  Win, lose or draw I'm satisfied with it.",
        "11": "It makes me relevantÂ  I'm always humbled byâ€‘â€‘ anytime I'm compared to one of the greatsÂ  Obviously in all our eyes Michael Jordan is the greatest player to ever play our gameÂ  So to be in the same breath as Michael Jordan is very humbling, and it let's me know that I've done something right so far. As far as the pressureâ€‘â€‘ I put no pressure on this FinalsÂ  I don't really care what people say about me, or how people categorize my soâ€‘called legacy or the way they think I should beÂ  I play this game at a high level and put myself in the position to help our team succeedÂ  I play for my teammates, our team, the city of Miami, my friends and family, and I gave it all for thatÂ  And at the end of the day win, lose or draw I'm satisfied with thatÂ  I don't get involved in what people say about me and my legacy, I think it's actually kind of stupid.

      "questions": {
        "1": "LeBron, when did it sort of dawn that this could be a special night that you guys would maybe have your ultimate game?Ã‚Â  Was it yesterday in practice?Ã‚Â  Was it the walkâ€‘through and shootaround today?Ã‚Â  Was it just when it got going?Ã‚Â  When did you sort of know that you absolutely hit your stride in this game?",
        "2": "LeBron, you took a lot of lumps earlier in your career from teams like Boston that were determined to kind of mentally shake you as part of their game planÂ  How much, if any, did those experiences help you get past all the goofiness of Lance Stephenson and the other stuff they were trying to do to you in this series?",
        "3": "LeBron, to use a word that Spo often coins, there was noise all year about Indiana's drive to win the East, and you look at the standings at one point, they were obviously comfortably up most of the yearÂ  Did doubt ever seep into the room at all that you guys would end up being in the position you're in right now?",
        "4": "Dwyane, for you, you're going to have another rematch, whether it's OKC or San AntonioÂ  Anything you learnedâ€‘â€‘",
        "5": "You weren't hereâ€‘â€‘",
        "6": "â€‘â€‘ when they beat Dallas the first time.",
        "8": "LeBron, you mentioned that you knew your path would be differentÂ  You told the guys thisÂ  But did you think, as you were kind of going through uneven stretches in the regular season, Dwyane being out for long periods of time, that you would be able to get to this level, particularly defensively?Ã‚Â  Did you think it was still in this team to get here?",
        "9": "LeBron, how did you restrain yourself when Lance put his hand on your face?Ã‚Â  And what was your reaction to his foul on Norris Cole?",
        "10": "Dwyane, a fifth time in nine years for you and U.D. to go The Finals, five in eight for LeBronâ€‘â€‘ I don't want you to feel excluded from another question now.",
        "12": "LeBron, earlier Frank Vogel came in hereÂ  I know you've dealt with your share of comparisons over the course of your career, but he said he felt like you guys were the Chicago Bulls of this era and that you're the Michael Jordan of this eraÂ  When you hear something like that, how does it make you feel?Ã‚Â  And do you feel this team is at that level?",
        "13": "LeBron, there was a lot of energy in this building from the opening tipÂ  How much were you guys able to feed off of that right from the get go?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "I mean, I don't knowÂ  I would say it had to be at the end of the first quarter we started to get a good groove, started to get a good groove, and we were down 9â€‘2 to start the gameÂ  From that point on, they only scored four pointsÂ  It's crazyÂ  They scored four points from that point on. We just locked in and got a good grooveÂ  I think it started with Bird coming into the gameÂ  His rebounding, his effort that he gave us when he came into the game gave us six defensive rebounds, gave us three buckets from drives from Norris and guys, and his dunk and his layup, I think that's what picked us up. And then Rashard was, obviously, the key to everythingÂ  His ability to stretch the floor, shoot the ball, and play the way he played tonightÂ  Once those guys got it going, I think we all fed off of it.",
        "2": "I always believe, a really good friend of mine told me that the best teacher in life is experienceÂ  When you go through so many things, you're able to learn from itÂ  You're able to know how to go about itÂ  Next time you face those trials and tribulations or whatever the case may come, and you're better prepared for it. So being around a group of guys like this, me being in positions that I've been in the past where I've failed, but I was never defeatedÂ  That was, for me, to be able to come back from failure and continue to come back and mentally be able to stay strong, it defines who you are as a man more than anything.",
        "3": "Not at allÂ  Not at allÂ  I felt likeâ€‘â€‘ I told the guys before the Eastern Conference or whatever, before the season evenâ€‘â€‘ before the playoffs started, that this was going to be our pathÂ  It's differentÂ  We're going to have to win on the roadÂ  We're going to have to start on somebody else's floor in order to be able to represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals. The guys, we all respondedÂ  We all took that challengeÂ  Obviously, we had the first two rounds on our floor, but we knew, if Indiana took care of business, we had to start on their floor, and we just had that mindsetÂ  We had that mindset, if we want to ultimately represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals, we had to win on the road, and we were able to accomplish that.",
        "4": "Not for me?Ã‚Â  I wasn't here?",
        "5": "No, I wasn't?",
        "6": "I don't get a rematch?",
        "8": "I believe, if we ever got to a point where our whole team was able to be available for Spo and for all of us, that we could compete with anybodyÂ  Never concerned about that. Obviously, going through the week and week and week and grinding months of a regular season, it was a toll on all of usÂ  But I felt like down the stretch, if we could get healthy, we could get everyone in uniform and have our full strength, it didn't matter what seed we wereÂ  I felt like we can represent the Eastern Conference again The Finals if we had the health, and we were able to accomplish that.",
        "9": "I don't knowÂ  I have no idea how I restrainedÂ  I don't knowÂ  I guess I just understand what the bigger picture is. It was uncalled for, for sureÂ  That wasâ€‘â€‘ I don't knowÂ  I'm at a loss of words with that, but it was uncalled for, and I was able to move on from itÂ  I let him know how I felt. I felt it could have beenâ€‘â€‘ the fact that it was Lance that hit Norris, it was a little bitâ€‘â€‘ you could have your own assumption of what it isÂ  If it was C.J. Watson hitting Norris, we'd have said he went for the ballÂ  The fact that it was Lance, we can say he went for his faceÂ  So wrong place at the wrong timeâ€‘â€‘ or at the right time for Lance, in his case.",
        "10": "Appreciate it.",
        "12": "Me and Dâ€‘Wade grew up watching the great Chicago Bulls team and the great Michael Jordan and the rest of those guysÂ  Any time I hear my name or our team in the same breath with legends and great teams and franchises, it's so humbling, manÂ  It's likeâ€‘â€‘ I really don't knowÂ  Just two kids from the inner cities, respective cities where they're fromÂ  We never thought we'd get to this point. So to be able to play the game that we love at a high level for one another, for our teammates, it's the ultimateÂ  When you hear the comparisons, you respect it, you're humbled by it, and you just feel like while you're in the moment hopefully, while you're playing the game, that you can make an impact enough to where you move on and people will start comparing you to ones that's in the game at the present time. So it's very, very humbling.",
        "13": "Not so wellÂ  We were down 9â€‘2Â  Obviously, we didn't do our part. But we knew our fans were going to come outÂ  It's a Friday night in MiamiÂ  We have an opportunity to close out, and our fans have been amazing thus farÂ  We just want to try to do our part. Obviously, the first couple minutes wasn't the start that we wanted, but we were able to get back into the game, and we just fed off the energy from our fans, fed off the energy from one another, and just kept it going."

        "5": "You obviously couldn't do much about this, not being in the game much, but in general, have you sensed lack of aggressiveness as a team for a reason why you didn't get to the freeâ€‘throw line more?Ã‚Â  Eight free throws unusually low for you guysÂ  Or were there some other factors that might have led to it?",
        "6": "Is it going to be one period to adjust?Ã‚Â  Last night's game plan was thrown out the window after five or six minutes.",

It's the two best teams in the Eastern Conference for a reasonÂ  They're going to make more adjustmentsÂ  We're going to make more adjustments, and you go from there.

        "1": "LeBron, can you talk about Rashard Lewis and what he's been able to contributeÂ  I know, Wade, you said, \"He's going to make a shot one of these days,\" and he finally did and knocked down six threes.",
        "2": "LeBron, can you go through that last play and what you saw obviously with Roy coming to help?",
        "3": "What did you think when Lance Stephenson came and blew in your ear?",
        "5": "LeBron, when you have to sit and watch so much of a basketball game that's important to you, how does that affect your mindset going into Game 6?",
        "6": "Does it make you more eager for the next game to come quicker?",
        "8": "LeBron, you said before this game, you said you guys didn't want to have to go back to Miami for a Game 6Â  How critical does Game 6 become so you don't have to come back into this building?",
        "9": "Yeah, you did.",
        "10": "You said something like that.",
        "11": "Something like that.",
        "12": "Is there an extra sense of urgency?",
        "13": "LeBron, do you think the biggest key for Game 6 down in South Beach is replicating the threeâ€‘point barrage up at the line or limiting turnovers?",
        "14": "LeBron, besides the goofiness with Lance, it looked like in the second half you were concerned he was sticking his leg underneath youÂ  Did you feel there was a dirty element to some of the stuff that was going on out there?",
        "15": "LeBron, on the final play, I asked Roy Hibbert about it, and his perspective, he said, \"You've got the best player in the world going to the hole.\"Ã‚Â  He was relieved to see you not go because he figured you'd probably get a call or else score and maybe win the gameÂ  Your thoughts on his thoughts?",

        "0": "I picked up some early foulsÂ  It's definitely something I'm not accustomed to, but my teammates kept it going and put us in a position to winÂ  That's all we can ask for.",
        "1": "We needed itÂ  We needed every bit of itÂ  Wish it would have resulted in a win when he started to make shots, it was big timeÂ  He gave us huge minutesÂ  His timely shots, defensive activityÂ  He's been great ever since he's been inserted into the lineup for sure.",
        "2": "Just called it outÂ  I was able to get into the paint, drew two, and saw C.B. in the corner in his sweet spotÂ  Thought we got a pretty good lookÂ  You live with the result.",

I mean, I'm just trying to winÂ  We need one more game to get The FinalsÂ  That's my only concernÂ  We put ourselves in a position to win tonight, and as competitors, as professionals, that's what we areÂ  At the end of the day, we put ourself in a position to winÂ  All the extra, whatever Lance wants to deal with, I don't really care about that.",
        "5": "Absolutely notÂ  It's a clean slate for myselfÂ  It sucks for me because I'm not able to make plays to help our team winÂ  I made a couple in the fourth, but 24 minutes is not enough for me to make an imprint on the game like I know I'm accustomed to doing or I know I can do. So you just continue to help the guys from the bench, let them know what you can see when you're in foul trouble, and ways we can try to exploit themÂ  But I'm much better on the floor than I am off of it for sure.",
        "6": "I mean, it is what it isÂ  We go back homeÂ  We learn from our mistakes tonight, and tomorrow we get ready for Friday.",
        "8": "I said that?",
        "9": "You think or I said that?",
        "10": "Yeah, I don't think I said that.",
        "11": "Yeah, okayÂ  Don't worry about itÂ  Obviously, we don't want to come backÂ  We come here to win. We'll focus on Game 6 nowÂ  Like I said before, we focus on the things that we can control and not the things we can't controlÂ  We learn from our mistakesÂ  17 turnovers on the road for 21 points is definitely not winning basketball in no way, shape, or formÂ  Like Dâ€‘Wade said, this game is imperfectÂ  You cover for those mistakesÂ  At the end of the day we put ourselves in position to win, and we look forward to the game on Friday.",
        "12": "It's Eastern Conference Finals, it should be urgency no matter what.",
        "13": "You can't control shots going inÂ  It's a makeâ€‘orâ€‘miss leagueÂ  I think turnovers for sureÂ  You can control thatÂ  You're going to have someÂ  We're an attack teamÂ  We're going to have attack turnoversÂ  Some of the careless turnovers, some of the swing passes, some of the entry passes where we were careless with them and we allowed them to get into the open floor, those are some of the things we can clear.",
        "14": "No. Ã‚Â We don't get involved in things that we can't controlÂ  That's not how we play ballÂ  Only thing we can control is how we approach the game in Game 6. Lance is LanceÂ  He's going to do what he needs to do to help his team winÂ  As to the leaders of our team, we're going to do what it takes to help our team win. The game is reffed by the refsÂ  They ref how they see itÂ  We play it, and you live with the results.",
        "15": "I mean, it's easy to say that after the factÂ  It's like playing cards, that's why they got backs on themÂ  You don't know what's going to happen. For me, my teammates trust me that I'm going to make the right play to help us winÂ  I trust myself that I'm going to make the right play to help us winÂ  And win, lose, or draw, you live with thatÂ  I don'tâ€‘â€‘ it doesn't matter from somebody else's perspective. We got a great lookÂ  C.B. makes that shot, then we go, we get a stop, and we're headed to The FinalsÂ  So it's a makeâ€‘orâ€‘miss leagueÂ  You don't think about things you could do in the pastÂ  You just correct them in the future.",
        "16": "Probably my wifeÂ  I blew in my wife's ear beforeÂ  That was definitely a defensive tactic. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  (Laughing) That's the second time that's happened to you.

        "3": "Do you find he's comical, his words?Ã‚Â Ã‚",
        "5": "LeBron, what do you think of the moves that Coach Spoelstra has made, particularly with the lineup and the rotation changing from game to game?",
        "6": "LeBron, every time you guys have been up 3â€‘1, it's always gone to 4â€‘1 in the next opportunity since you guys have been together down hereÂ  Going up there is going to be quite an atmosphere, obviously, but can you already envision what it's going to take to close them out on Wednesday?",
        "7": "You said that Chris was key to the fast startÂ  How did you guys help get him involved early?",
        "9": "Guys, Paul went even further than just to say that the win or loss was at the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  Paul came in here and said, oh, it was home cookingÂ  What do you think when you hear a team make such a big deal out of it?",
        "10": "LeBron, pregame you said that you had a good idea of how you wanted to get the game startedÂ  Hearing you speak now, was it to get Chris going, or was yourself involved part that have?"

        "0": "Chris BoshÂ  We got off to that fast start because Chris Bosh came out and got it going early.",
        "2": "No, I don't need any motivationÂ  I'm motivated enough to try to get back The FinalsÂ  That's motivating enough, and being one of the leaders of this team, I have to do my jobÂ  I have to do my part to help us winÂ  That's what it's all about.",
        "3": "I got a smirk out of it.",
        "5": "The fact thatâ€‘â€‘ it makes it a lot easier for Spo when you have true professionals, guys that can sit out for one month, two months, two weeks, and get the nod, and they're ready to go right then and thereÂ  That makes it a lot easier on our coaching staff to have the locker room and the group of guys we have. That's why Spo and Riles and those guys went out and got this teamÂ  It wasn't just about the game of basketballÂ  It's about what they bring to the locker room as wellÂ  To insert U.D. back into the starting lineup and then take him out and insert RashardÂ  Or when Dâ€‘Wade went down and Toney Douglas came in or J.J. came in in the Charlotte seriesÂ  It's whateverÂ  G.O.'s number could still get calledÂ  B's number could still get calledÂ  Those guys are readyÂ  That's the type of locker room we have. It makes it a lot easier for Coach when you have that type of luxury. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  I don't remember the question (laughing). Ã‚Â He took care of it. LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  I took care of itÂ  Don't worry about itÂ  I got you.",
        "6": "It's going to take a better game than we had tonightÂ  It's that simpleÂ  You have to get better every gameÂ  Their back is against the wall, but we have to go in with that mindset that our back is against the wall, too. We don't want to come back with a Game 6Â  We love our fans, obviouslyÂ  We love being in Miami, but we want to try to close it outÂ  But we're going to have to work for itÂ  It's not going to be easy, not against this teamÂ  It's the No.1 team in the Eastern Conference, and they're there for a reasonÂ  So we look forward to the challenge.",
        "7": "The first play of the game was ran for him, and he opened it up with a jumperÂ  Second play, Dâ€‘Wade drove the ball, kicked it to him in the corner, and he hit a threeÂ  From that point on, he just got it going. He had 10 points in the first quarterÂ  Should have had 12; he missed two free throwsÂ  I haven't seen that from him in a while, but he just got it goingÂ  We rode him that whole first quarter, and it gave us the 27â€‘19 lead.",
        "9": "For us, we just want to play great basketballÂ  We don't really get involved in whatever that we can't controlÂ  What we can control is how we approach the game from an offensive and defensive standpoint, and that's with aggressionÂ  That's how we approach the game. At the end of the game, whatever the end results is, we can be satisfied with that if we brought our gameÂ  Everything else doesn't matterÂ  When you get between the lines of the court, 94 feet, and you got to get in between, and you got to play itÂ  That's all we try to worry aboutÂ  We can't worry about nothing else.",
        "10": "It was to get Chris goingÂ  We needed it from himÂ  C.B. had been struggling offensively the last few games, and we needed thatÂ  We needed it from him. So Spo called it, and I was able toâ€‘â€‘ Dâ€‘Wade was able to make the passÂ  I was able to slice over the top to release pressure from him, make Hibbert back up into the lane, and that got him his first shot. That was the game plan for usÂ  We've been talking about it the last couple of days, how are we going to get C.B. going?Ã‚Â  It worked out for us tonight."

        "1": "What's been the key to guarding Paul George in this series?",
        "2": "What does it say about this team that any lineup can be out there at any given moment?Ã‚Â  How much comfort does that give you?",
        "3": "Are you cognizant of wearing Paul out a little bit?",

        "7": "Yes.",
        "8": "LeBron, in the last two games, how much work have you done on making the Pacers adjust to you guys and vice versa?",
        "9": "Can you describe in the fourth quarter of the playoff game, sort of how the intensity ratchets up?",
        "10": "So what are the qualities of this team that gets the results in the fourth quarter?",
        "11": "LeBron, one point made on the ABC broadcast last night by two of the commentators was it's not a good idea to start trash talking youÂ  They made that comment in regard to LanceÂ  Does that have any impact on you when you hear noise from the opponent?",
        "12": "You're already very engaged regardless of that, but does that make you even moreâ€‘â€‘ I don't know what the word would beâ€‘â€‘ focused, engaged, when someone starts doing that to you?",
        "13": "How did it work yesterday when Lance was mouthing at you?Ã‚Â  What effect did it have?",
        "14": "LeBron, you trailed for long stretches in the first three gamesÂ  Even though you're up 2â€‘1, do you feel your best game is still out there?",
        "15": "In the third quarter, when you had the cramp, you didn't want to go to the locker room until you saw what Dwyane did in that possessionÂ  I know you expect a lot of him anyways, but is there even more of an expectation when he's out there without you that you think he'sâ€‘â€‘ when the onus is on him to carry it like that?",
        "16": "What did you think of the way he went at Hibbert yesterday?Ã‚Â  He didn't seem deterred by that at all?",
        "17": "LeBron, what's been the key in the fourth quarters the last two games?",
        "18": "How much faith have you had in guys coming off the bench?",
        "19": "On a team with this much talent, this much star potential, if you will, Rashard's got tons of play last night for good reasonÂ  What's that kind of say about the role guys accept coming off that bench?",
        "20": "The point keeps being made that Ray in the fourth quarter, especially with the threeâ€‘pointers, you guys have felt the sting of that for years and to get him on your side was a big dealÂ  How much went into that thinking when you were recruiting Ray Allen?",
        "21": "Against a great defensive team like Indiana, how has Dwyane been able to be so efficient?",
        "22": "Do you like to see him play the three every now and then?",
        "23": "Was it the offensive foul that was called against you that kind of set you off with Stephenson?",
        "24": "Ray mentioned last night that you guys save the high energy on defensesÂ  The other guys [indiscernible].",
        "25": "You said that you felt like the best game for this team is still out thereÂ  Earlier in the series, you talked about the fact that this is a team that plays better as the series goes onÂ  Why is that the case?"

      "answers": {
        "0": "It's just our type of basketballÂ  Like I said, it doesn't result in a win all the time, but when we play our type of basketball, we'll be satisfied with the results. So we came out, and we didn't start that way, but we finished that wayÂ  Just happy with the outcome.",
        "1": "Just want to make it tough on himÂ  Any great player, good player, whatever, just try to make it tough on himÂ  Make him put up contested shots, multiple bodies. Ã‚Â Make it tough.",
        "2": "When you have guys that's been in the moment, it's not hardÂ  You have so many guys you can go to that's been a part of this whole run, and guys are confident enough that, when they get on the floor, they can make things happen.",
        "3": "Say that again?",
        "4": "I try to wear any defender out in that regardÂ  I put pressure on himÂ  Got to do it on both endsÂ  So me as a player, I've got to put pressure on the defense, not only the person guarding me, but the second and third line.",
        "5": "On Paul?",
        "6": "I have?Ã‚Â  As much as I did with Paul?",
        "7": "That's kind of surprisingÂ  I think he's an unbelievable talentÂ  I can't take a possession off against himÂ  I think last night to start the game he'd gotten me on two straight possessions where I didn't follow my keys and he scored. Any player like that, you have to account forÂ  Just can't have any lapsesÂ  You leave him open for an open three, he knocks it downÂ  If it you're not low into him in transition, he's going to get to the laneÂ  He's going to make free throwsÂ  So he's one of the best I've went against in the postseason. It's good, thoughÂ  It's great to have that competition.",
        "8": "We've done a great job of thatÂ  We want to play our type of basketball, like I said, very aggressive, very disruptive, and live with the results.",
        "9": "The winning timeÂ  No matter what's going on the first three quarters, the postseason in games is usually decided by five points or less and one or two possessions. So in the fourth quarter, you've got to be able to lock in and execute both offensively and defensively and give yourself a good chance to win.",
        "10": "We don't panicÂ  We've got guys that stay in the moment, that thrives on the moment, and just try to make the right plays to help our team win.",
        "11": "I don't have anyÂ  I'm not much of a talker, but I canÂ  I don't ever start it, but I can get involved in it, and I'm able to still keep my head and understand what needs to be done to help our team win. But winning the game is more importantÂ  I understand what the main goal is.",
        "12": "Sometimes.",
        "13": "It doesn't matterÂ  The competition is already hotÂ  You don't need itÂ  I think it's a great competition.",
        "14": "Yeah, we haven't played our best gameÂ  They probably feel the same wayÂ  We haven't started how we want to, how we need toÂ  So we think our best basketball is yet to come.",
        "15": "He canÂ  That's what our team is built forÂ  When one of the guys goes out, we're able to still hold the fortÂ  It's great to see the way he closed out the quarterÂ  The way he's been playing in the conference finalsÂ  We need it all.",
        "16": "He shouldn't beÂ  Hibbert is a great player, a great defender, but you've got to put pressure on him.",
        "17": "No turnovers and flying around defensively, creating turnoversÂ  We do that, and we're going to get good shotsÂ  We're one of the best shooting teams in the leagueÂ  We're going to get great shotsÂ  We just can't turn the ball over.",
        "18": "We always have faith in themÂ  It's the postseasonÂ  It's been thereÂ  We have faith in everyone that comes into the game.",
        "19": "It's big timeÂ  For the nonâ€‘basketball people, you look at this stat sheet and see zeros across the boardÂ  When he was on the floor, it was a plus 21Â  That's winning basketball. He sacrificed, defended, and he helped us get the leadÂ  There's a plus on the floor with him out thereÂ  So those minutes was key.",
        "20": "That was the number one thingÂ  I've always joked with him over the years that we needed to team up, even when he wasâ€‘â€‘ even in Boston when we were going through our thingÂ  The fact that it happened and I was able to be a part of itÂ  This is what we envisioned. His work ethic, his professionalism, what he brings to the game, it pays offÂ  Throughout the whole season, not just now, but it's great that it's happening now for sure.",
        "21": "Because great offense beats great defenseÂ  He's a great offensive playerÂ  He's a great playerÂ  The rhythm that he's in right now, his pullup is goingÂ  He's shooting the threeÂ  He's getting into the lane shooting his floaters. So that's how it always worksÂ  I mean, great defense, obviously, we're going against, but Dâ€‘Wade's in a great rhythm right now, and we need him to keep going.",
        "22": "Yeah, got to keep the defense honest.",
        "23": "NoÂ  No, I don't need to get set off with Stephenson. One thing I'm not going to do is give you all a storyline with LeBron and StephensonÂ  I'm not going to do thatÂ  It's the Pacers versus the HeatÂ  Not going to get involved in that. I've already been involved in a LeBron versus Stephenson in my playoff careerÂ  So I'm not going to start with another StephensonÂ  Not going to do itÂ  You won't get me today.",
        "24": "Yeah, we doÂ  We've got to do a better job of being more conscious about knowing that guys feed off us, especially at the start of the gameÂ  We can't come out with such a low motor and just feel the game out. I'm one of those guysÂ  I kind of feel the game out to start the game, but maybe I need to be a little bit different in this series because it's not gotten us off to a good start.",
        "25": "Just because we're a team that's got to learn our opponent, continue to lock in on their likes, their dislikes, what they like to do, what they don't like to doÂ  That's how we kind of like morph into a better team as the series goes on. I think we've played better in Game 2 than we did in Game 1Â  I think last night, besides the first 14 minutes, 16 minutes, we played betterÂ  So hopefully, we can just ramp it up another level tomorrow.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, first off, how bad was the cramp issue?Ã‚Â  Assuming it was a crampÂ  Second, seeing Dwyane hit that three before you went into the hallway, did that help or hurt at that point?",
        "3": "It seemed like this was really sort of the ultimate strategic test, maybe for Spo, the way he picked up the pace, went to pressure, the way he put Rashard on David West, the way you guys took advantage of West guarding Ray and then Norris' energyÂ  Did you just sort of feel that you guys started to push the right buttons along the way?Ã‚Â  How does it feel when you see your coach pushing those buttons and getting the results you guys desperately needed?",
        "6": "LeBron, after you guys got through that first quarter, did you feel like the rest of the game this is as close as you've gotten to playing the style of game that you guys want to enforce in this series?",
        "8": "LeBron, you guys ran a lot of great sets to get Ray open in the fourth quarterÂ  Was that a conscious change in strategy, or does that kind of just happen organically, when he hits a couple of shots, you all try to get him open?",
        "9": "Over the last three years, you guys have been behind on the Pacers in the series and in games numerous times, but you seem like you've been able to come back and win most of the times in situationsÂ  Do you just have a lot of confidence against this team?",
        "10": "LeBron, can you just talk about the play from Norris Cole tonight, especially defensively when he was pressuring their guards, Watson and Stephenson?",
        "11": "LeBron, you mentioned all that Ray does to get himself openÂ  Were you surprised at all that they've tried David West on him now in three straight games?Ã‚Â  It seems like an unusual matchup for them to work on."

      "answers": {
        "0": "I'm fineÂ  Probably just got a little dehydrated tonightÂ  It's been four days since we playedÂ  Just playing as hard as we could tonight. I try to prevent that from happening, but it happenedÂ  Dâ€‘Wade came in and closed the quarter outÂ  I wasn't going to leave until I saw what he was going to doÂ  He drained and put us up ten, and I was all right.",
        "3": "He definitely did that by putting the right personnel on the floorÂ  Obviously, we started the game with mental turnovers, mental breakdowns, mostly coming from us offensivelyÂ  He pushed the right buttons, bringing in Norris, giving Rashard a nod, Bird came in with his energy every night he plays. Those guys off the bench, man, they did it for us tonightÂ  They got the game ball for sure.",
        "6": "Well, for us, we have to play our type of basketballÂ  We have to be disruptiveÂ  We have to speed up the team that we're going against, and we have to fly around defensively. When we lay back, we're justâ€‘â€‘ everything that we've built, it just doesn't workÂ  We just lay back and allow teams to come down and set up their offenseâ€‘â€‘ or whatever the case may be, even offensively, when we're just passing the ball around and being very passive. We're an attack teamÂ  When we get into our game, so many things happen for us, and we're even able to cover up for some of the mistakes we make both offensively and defensively.",
        "8": "Ray creates so much for our team, just his ability just to move without the ball, to shoot the ballÂ  He shifts the defense by himself, and it's a greatâ€‘â€‘ I mean, it's great that we have that. No matter who's on him, him coming off pinâ€‘downs, he's one of the few on our team that can do that, that can create two on the ball, and he's always in constant motionÂ  He's got it going, man, and we just want to continue to find him. I was able to find him for the majority of the shots that he had tonight in the fourth quarter, and when you got a hot hand, you just keep going to it.",
        "9": "We have a lot of confidence versus our opponent, but we don't want to keep digging holesÂ  We hate the way we played to start the gameÂ  We can't play that type of basketballÂ  We've got to come out and play like we're down 15 to start the game because they can't bite us in the butt if we don't prepare that way. But we're a confidence groupÂ  We don't panicÂ  We just work the gameÂ  Obviously, the start of the game, it wasn't the type of basketball that we're accustomed to playingÂ  We turned the ball over way too much, and myself and a couple other guys had a few turnovers. But we just got into our gameÂ  We kept going, getting into our gameÂ  We started putting pressure on them defensively, offensively, and we were able to get back into the game at the end of the second quarter.",
        "10": "Norris, he's greatÂ  He's great for our teamÂ  He's a change of pace fromâ€‘â€‘ we have our starting point guard in Rio, and when we go to Norris, he changes the tempoÂ  That's when you need with guys off the bench, you need energy guysÂ  We have a few of them, but Norris, he's great. He's been inâ€‘â€‘ this is his third yearÂ  He's still young, but he's been in all the pressure situations, obviously, so he's able to come in and be confidentÂ  As the leaders of the team, we try to give him confidence. Defensively, though, it's his markÂ  He makes his mark defensivelyÂ  He makes us all step up our game defensively as well, and then offensively, whatever he gives us is always extra credit for usÂ  He attacks the rim, gets himself looks, gets our great guys looks, and it's great to have him.",
        "11": "Not surprisedÂ  They've done it for two yearsÂ  Two years straight, he's guarded Ray when we went smallÂ  So not surprised at all. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "6": "LeBron, have you ever had a concussion?",
        "7": "LeBron, what's changed over the last year or so?Ã‚Â  You seem to be more vocal about thingsÂ  Has anything changed outside of basketball?",
        "8": "Dwyane said you went into Game 2 with a healthy fear, basically just you guys knowing the gravity of the situationÂ  Does that accurately describe it?",
        "9": "How do you maintain that now?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Not really, not last yearÂ  We know the fact they can win on the roadÂ  We said that coming into the series, both teams can win on each other's floorÂ  So we understand that.",
        "1": "Sure, why wouldn't he?",
        "2": "That's the way it should be.",
        "3": "Do I have to give a reason why he should sell the team?Ã‚Â  He shouldn't be part of this league.",
        "4": "It's very importantÂ  We don't want this to linger around our sportÂ  It sucks that it happened, but the players and the owners and everyone associated with the game know there's no need for itÂ  The quicker it gets done, the sooner we can move on.",
        "5": "No.",
        "6": "Not that I can rememberÂ  Should I say that?",
        "7": "I don't knowÂ  Just maturity, being a role model and a leader in my sportÂ  It's not something where I need to do itÂ  It's something I want to do being in the position I'm in.",
        "8": "Just rise to the occasionÂ  Our backs were against the wallÂ  Obviously, going down 0â€‘2 was not an optionÂ  You can go in with that mindset and it doesn't always result in a win, but I think our mindset going into that game was very aggressive and understanding we had to come out with a win of the that's the type of feeling we had.",
        "9": "We're back on our home floorÂ  We've had an opportunity to regainâ€‘â€‘ not regain, or gain home courtÂ  That doesn't guarantee anything as wellÂ  Like I said, both teams are very goodÂ  Both teams are in the Final Four for a reasonÂ  So we've got to go out and play.

        "1": "Do you ever wonder if it doesn't work, what the repercussions are?",
        "2": "Why did it work so well when Norris went on to Stephenson?Ã‚Â  What did you know about that?",
        "3": "LeBron, do you think around the league players have that same kind of open input, where the coach will actually listen and take some of it?",

        "7": "It used to be a Dolphin townÂ  They don't know the quarterback anymore, but they can name at least six players deep on a Heat benchÂ  You're responsible for changing this town.",
        "8": "LeBron, with what George went through with concussions and things like that, most players are proud and want to continue playingÂ  Like when you broke your nose, how much does a player just want to play through it?",
        "9": "Do you expect him to play on Saturday?",
        "10": "Do you expect it to affect his game in any way on Saturday?",

      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, we've been together long enough where we just place guys on certain matchups when we feel like that particular guy can control it, or at least handle the situation. I'm usually the culprit of putting guys in a position where I want them to be defensively, and we have a system where guys just react.",
        "1": "NoÂ  If a guy's playing hard, he'll be there with the results.",
        "2": "Stephenson's a great player, man, and for us we just wanted to put a guy on him that we know can guard the ball. Stephenson's a great ball handler, especially off the pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollÂ  So we felt like the matchup with Norris would be good.",
        "3": "I don't knowÂ  I know what our team is about, and he's always allowed me, and obviously Dâ€‘Wade, who's been here tenâ€‘plus years, to make adjustments in game that we feel is best for the team.",

        "5": "I don't know which season, but it's been a while now.",
        "6": "It means everythingÂ  I do so much with kids and underprivileged kidsÂ  To see the smiles and the joy on their faces when I get an opportunity to be with them and to know that we have so much support throughout South Florida, throughout Florida and all over the world, it means so much. For us as players, we have to continue to be role models, continue to be leaders to those kidsÂ  It's pretty cool.",
        "7": "No, not just meÂ  It started a long time ago when Mickey took over the team, brought Pat down here, and the rest is historyÂ  I'm just a piece of the puzzle.",
        "8": "I think every last player in the Final Four would have played through itÂ  This is the conference finals, and obviously, a concussion is very seriousÂ  Our concussion test is not as extensive as the NFLÂ  It doesn't happen as muchÂ  I think all of us would have played through it under the circumstances.",
        "9": "Yeah.",
        "10": "No.",

        "12": "No, I heard about itÂ  I don't really have thoughts about itÂ  I'm in the middle of conference finalsÂ  I'm not worried about draft lotteries and that conversationÂ  That's the last thing on my mind.",
        "13": "Well, I came down to Miami for a reason, to win championships, and he had a lot to do with itÂ  That's what it's all aboutÂ  He's a winnerÂ  He believes in familyÂ  He believes in what it means to be a great coach and to have leaders and leadership around here.

        "0": "LeBron, you had a pretty quiet night for three quarters, then the fourth quarter you exploded for 12Â  Do you already have the mindset that you can get buckets whenever you want?",
        "2": "LeBron, were you happy with the way you all banged with David West tonight?Ã‚Â  He went 5 of 16 from the fieldÂ  Can you talk about what you did defensively on him this time.",
        "5": "For both of you guys, what was the biggest difference defensively between Game 1 and Game 2?",
        "7": "LeBron, Norris said in the locker room that you actually were the one that kind of tabbed him and said, \"Why don't you pick up Stephenson?\"Ã‚Â  Is that right?Ã‚Â  And he said you continued to do it as the game went on.",
        "9": "LeBron, how does going back to Miami with a split 1â€‘1 affect the way you work through these next three days in between games 2 and 3?",
        "10": "For both you guys, at the end of the game you guys at one point scored 20 consecutive points, and a lot of it was playing off each otherÂ  Can you talk about the kind of mental telepathy that you guys kind of have in that situation where you both read and react to each other?",
        "12": "LeBron, you talk about covering for each otherÂ  You had a play where you blocked the ball and went for the layup and missed and Dwyane followed it up and put it inÂ  How important is that play in keeping the run going?Ã‚Â  Dwyane, if you could explain what you saw in that play."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, I just play the gameÂ  However the game presents itself, I just try to take advantage of it. I needed to do something in the fourthÂ  I did a great job in the third quarter of attacking and getting my guys some open looksÂ  I hit Cole for two threes, hit C.B. for a three, but I needed to make a few buckets as well to help us in the fourth quarter, and I was able to come through for us.",
        "2": "Just tried to keep a body on himÂ  Very good playerÂ  Our bigs took a challenge on him all nightÂ  Just try to run him off the shotÂ  When he drove, just tried to keep a chest in front of himÂ  Made him take contested shots over the topÂ  Offensively, we just tried to attack him as wellÂ  Put him in some pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls. He got a couple of early quick foulsÂ  So that maybe got him out of rhythm, tooÂ  But our bigs did a great job on him.",
        "5": "We got back to play Miami Heat basketballÂ  We flew around, covered for one another. Ã‚Â Even when we made mistakes, we still covered for one another. We allowed them in Game 1 to dictate what our defense did, and that's not usÂ  They had us on our heels the whole game, and that's not how we play basketballÂ  Every time we lose, we alwaysâ€‘â€‘ that's the first thing that we can see. Defensively today, we came out with an aggressive mindsetÂ  Even if we made mistakes, guys had to cover for one another, and I think we did that for 48 minutes.",
        "7": "Yeah, absolutelyÂ  Norris isâ€‘â€‘ I mean, he's all about defenseÂ  He's all about team. Ã‚Â Whatever it takes to win. I believe that he'll be a good matchup on Stephenson, even though Stephenson is a bigger guyÂ  He's going to get some shots over himÂ  He's going to make some plays, but I think Norris can lock in on himÂ  And it allowed Dâ€‘Wade to shift to Paul George and allowed me to shift to George Hill. So that versatility that we have on our wings at that point, it helps a lotÂ  But for me as a leader, I just try to give confidence to guys, and I was confident enough for Norris to take on that challengeÂ  Lance had it going, and at the same time, Norris got it going on the other end offensively too, making two threes in a clutch situation.",
        "9": "I think the three days are going to allow us to prepare for Game 3Â  Even though we won, we're going to break down the film as if we lost and see ways we can get better even with some of the mistakes that we made. I think the best thing about tonight, even though we made mistakes, we were flying around, and we were playing the type of basketball that we wanted to playÂ  When we do that, we give ourself a great chance to win, and we can live with the results. So with these three days, we're not comfortable, and we're not satisfied at allÂ  We came hereÂ  We got Game 2, but Game 3 is a new game, and we're going to start preparing for that tomorrow and get ready for it on Saturday.",
        "10": "We have no idea we're doing that until we hear it after the game, which is our planÂ  We believe it doesn't matter whoever has the ball in each other's hand, we're going to make the right play not only for ourselves but for our team. Tonight was one of those nights once again, where we were making plays, finding guys, and finding each other, finding a good rhythm with the ball in our hands. We don't know we're doing those things, but we just try to make plays and do whatever it takes to help our team win.",
        "12": "It was a huge momentum playÂ  We did a great job on that possessionÂ  Hibbert got the ball, and our big did a great job of pressuring him, and he took a couple dribbles and then stopped, and everybody just locked in on their individual man. Dâ€‘Wade kept the Paul from Paul George getting itÂ  Norris kept it from LanceÂ  C.B. kept it from David West, and I was trying to do the same thing to George HillÂ  When George Hill got the ball, I just tried to lock in on himÂ  I was able to get a steal. Usually, Dâ€‘Wade don't even chase me downÂ  He knows if it's a oneâ€‘onâ€‘one matchup with me, most of the time I'm going to scoreÂ  I was glad that he didÂ  I missed the layup, and he was able to tipâ€‘dunk itÂ  Huge momentum play in the fourth quarter when we needed it the most. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  Yeah, like he said, 99.9 percent of the time, when he's oneâ€‘onâ€‘one with someone, we take our chancesÂ  Just at that moment, I actually noticed he didn't really get the acceleration like he neededÂ  He took a step and didn't get upÂ  So that allowed me to keep following himÂ  Normally, he explodes, and there's not many people that can meet him at the topÂ  He didn't get the explosion on the layup that he needed. I just followed him, and that time I was just trying to make a playÂ  He missed it, and luckily I was there to put it back in. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "That's neither here nor there at this pointÂ  We're down 0â€‘1Â  We can't worry about what we did or how we came into Game 1Â  We have to learn from it and go into Game 2 with a better mindset.",

        "4": "Nothing is that badÂ  We played a pretty good gameÂ  We just didn'tâ€‘â€‘ we had a couple breakdowns against a team that in the Eastern Conference Finals, you can't have that many breakdowns. It wasn't a bad game at allÂ  We scored 97 points, got 54 points in the paintÂ  We had 23 assists, only 11 turnoversÂ  But we had some breakdowns defensively that allowed them to get some good shots.",
        "5": "Well, he's a space guy for us, but it would be great if we can mix it up a little bit with him and get some timely threes, some midrange, and also some attacks around the rim that make him even more dangerous.",
        "6": "Well, my approach is the same every gameÂ  Try to put pressure on the defense, try to get to the freeâ€‘throw line, help us win outsideÂ  I didn't get to the freeâ€‘throw line as much as I would like, but I got to the rim, got my shots goingÂ  I've got to do a little more as well.",
        "7": "We're a team that gets better as a series goes onÂ  We learn from our mistakes, and I think we did today going over our film session, things that we can do betterÂ  That's a good thing about our teamÂ  We're able to bounce back.",
        "8": "I thought I was pretty aggressiveÂ  Honestly, you have to have a whistle to get to the freeâ€‘throw line as well tooÂ  I thought I was aggressiveÂ  I had some good looks from the outsideÂ  But I was pretty aggressive.",
        "9": "We have a tougher frontcourt, obviously, when he's out thereÂ  We're a little biggerÂ  Obviously, he's not the biggest guy, as far as height and weight, but he is as far as a warrior mentality and heart for sureÂ  So it definitely helps us. I'm not sure what the lineup is going to be tomorrow, but whoever comes into the game, whoever starts the game, we need all of them.",
        "10": "It's differentÂ  It's a huge adjustment starting the game off that wayÂ  Able to spot on the four, I can do pretty effectivelyÂ  It was definitely a challenge for meÂ  I don't think personally I was in the right spots at the right time.",
        "11": "No, I didn't see it because I don't watch or listen or read.",
        "12": "Shane is a huge piece to our puzzleÂ  Paul George got into a good rhythm in Game 1Â  Offensively he was very effective, very efficientÂ  We've just got to do a better job on not only him but all of them. Lance was veryâ€‘â€‘ he was effectiveÂ  C.J. was effectiveÂ  George Hill was effectiveÂ  All those guys, they gotâ€‘â€‘ all those guys got what they wanted offensively, and we didn't do a good enough job helping each other.",
        "13": "I really don't get involved in antics that have nothing to do with the game.",
        "14": "We did have more guys involvedÂ  We just didn't make the shotsÂ  When shots don't come, we don't worry about thatÂ  We had 23 assistsÂ  We only had 11 turnoversÂ  Guys were involved. I felt like [indiscernible] got some great looksÂ  He missed a couple in the laneÂ  C.B. got some great looksÂ  He just missed himÂ  So I don't worry about that.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you guys played a solid game all the way through with the exception of the threeâ€‘point line you guys struggled with just 26 percentÂ  What were they doing defensively to cause you guys so many problems?",
        "2": "LeBron, what was the breakdown defensively?",
        "3": "LeBron, normally your team in the playoffs especially is really good at pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll defenseÂ  You kind of touched on itÂ  Is that something that you all have to go back and watch film and try to figure it out, or is it just instinct?",
        "4": "Besides cleaning up the pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll defense, what are some of the things you guys feel like you need to do in Game 2 to even this thing up?",
        "5": "LeBron, going with Shane instead of Udonis, which I think you guys had spoken about was possibly more likely, put you at the four a little bit moreÂ  Against this type of physical team, considering the success you had with U.D. in last two games against them, one, were you surprised by the lineup?Ã‚Â  And how does this change the dynamic with you having to go in the four and play smaller against us?",
        "6": "LeBron, following up on that, how did you think that the small lineup at the start affected the team?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't think we played a solid game all the way throughÂ  We had a lot of mistakes, and they took advantage of it. Obviously, a threeâ€‘point shot is a big thing for our team, and tonight they weren't thereÂ  No one had it goingÂ  We had some really good looksÂ  They didn't fall, and we just got to do a better job executing in the next game.",
        "2": "A little bit of everywhereÂ  I mean, they got some threes early onÂ  Our pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll coverage had a lot of breakdowns, including myself; I broke down a few times defensively, and we allowed them to get into the paintÂ  I mean, they shot 37 free throws to our 15, which is definitely something that we can't duplicate going into Game 2. But we had some breakdowns throughout the game, and that's what resulted in us losing this gameÂ  As a veteran ball club, we will watch the film and break it down and be better prepared in Game 2.",
        "3": "It will be a little bit of bothÂ  Just because you watch it on film doesn't mean it's going to be exactly how you want to play in itÂ  You've got to be able to read and adjust on the fly. But I think going into Game 2 we'll be more mentally prepared for their actions and have a game plan of how we're going to cover their pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  They did a great job with their pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls, with Roy setting it or David setting it and exploited us.",
        "4": "The game's still so freshÂ  It's too hard just to say, well, we need to do this better in Game 2Â  We need to evaluate our mistakes and things we did well in Game 1 first before I can say what we need to bring to Game 2. Tomorrow will be a gameâ€‘â€‘ I mean, will be a day when we watch film and start to prepare for Tuesday.",
        "5": "We wasn't surprised because Spo told us what the lineup was going to beÂ  So we weren't surprisedÂ  It's got to be a collective group, not just one guys or two guys. We all have to get down there and help everybody outÂ  They outrebounded us by nineÂ  So we've got to do a better job of that. We will seeÂ  We'll make adjustments, and we'll be a better team in Game 2.",
        "6": "We just gave them too many points in the first quarterÂ  We let George Hill get into a real good groove to start the gameÂ  And from that point on, I mean, they hit 30 on us, and we just broke down defensively, had a couple of breakdowns, couple of miscommunication errorsÂ  Like I said, which we will clean up. They took care of business Game 1, and we'll figure it out going into Game 2."

        "1": "Talk about Kyrie winning the MVP.",
        "2": "It seemed to us that we, as expected, had these few little moments of oneâ€‘onâ€‘one action between you and Kevin DurantÂ  Can you elaborate a little bit and tell us if it's fun for you.",
        "3": "Did you say anything before the game about winning the game?Ã‚Â  The first play of the game you stepped in the passing lane and dunkedÂ  Was that a tone setter?",
        "4": "Not a lot has gone well for Cleveland since you leftÂ  What will it mean for that city to sort of have a good vibe with Kyrie winning MVP?",
        "5": "You were the last Cavalier, I think the only one, that has ever won that awardÂ  What is it like to win it at such a young age like Kyrie won it?Ã‚Â  And also what did you tell him I think in regards to holding the trophy up?",
        "6": "A lot gets made of the Bullsâ€‘Heat rivalry, yet you and Noah played really well togetherÂ  What is it about his game that complements your game so well?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We got stops and we made shotsÂ  And we didn't turn the ball overÂ  Very keyÂ  We wanted this winÂ  They beat us the last three years and they had a lot of bragging rights, so to be able to come through being down 18 was huge.",
        "1": "Kyrie is specialÂ  It's just that simpleÂ  He's a very special basketball player, very smart basketball playerÂ  His ability to shoot the ball, get into the lane, make shots around the rim, he has a total package. And I've always known thatÂ  I've always witnessed that, and ever since he was in high schoolÂ  And I'm extremely happy for him, extremely proud for him to receive this awardÂ  It's big time.",
        "2": "I think it's funner for you guys more than it is for meÂ  I'm not a â€‘â€‘ I focus on the team gameÂ  I play team basketballÂ  I've always played that way. Obviously myself and Kevin are trying to do great things individually, and when we get that matchup, it is funÂ  But I don't just zero in on a oneâ€‘onâ€‘one matchup no matter if it's even just the Allâ€‘Star Game.",
        "3": "Yeah, we wanted itÂ  I've been a part of the last three and in defeatÂ  And we been getting killed a lot this season, talking about the Eastern Conference is pretty bad, it's a twoâ€‘man race and we're not holding up our end of the bargain, so it was special to get this win.",
        "4": "I don't think they needed Kyrie Irving to win this to have a good vibeÂ  I think they know they have someone specialÂ  He's very specialÂ  And I just think that it probably adds a cherry on top for him to receive this awardÂ  Not only for the Cavs, but for Duke, St. Patrick's, and everywhere he's ever played. Being as young as he is, his second Allâ€‘Star appearance and to be able to come out with the MVP just validates and solidifies why he's in this game and why he's one of the best point guards that we have in our league today.",
        "5": "Well, first of all, to be able to win at a young age, it gives you another boost of confidenceÂ  Obviously you know you're in the game for a reason, he was voted in by the fans for a reason, but it just gives you another boost of confidence knowing that you can play this game at the highest level. I just wanted him to have his moment, and the moment is holding that trophy above your headÂ  It's the few moments in our year where you do thatÂ  Winning a championship, it's winning the MVP, the other championship is winning the MVP of the Allâ€‘Star GameÂ  And those are those momentsÂ  And he wasâ€‘â€‘ seemed like he didn't know exactly what to do, and I just wanted to try to give him a little tip.",
        "6": "Any big that can set pick and rolls, catch and finish, I can work well withÂ  And I don't need no time to get chemistryÂ  And he's a highâ€‘energy guy, a highâ€‘IQ guy, and I found something in that fourth quarter knowing that I could use his screen and rolls and he would dive to the rim and I could either get him an open look. Or the next possession down after he had just got the layup and I was able to find Paul George and he got fouled on a 3â€‘point play because of him receiving that pass the time before. So I don't need much time with guys like that, highâ€‘energy guys and highâ€‘IQ basketball players. THE MODERATOR:Ã‚Â  Thank you, LeBron. LEBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  Thanks.

        "1": "This is more than a twoâ€‘team raceÂ  There's a lot of good teams in the Eastern ConferenceÂ  It's been a slow start for us as a whole, but there's so many good teams you can't just count on us and one other teamÂ  I respect every team we go against. It's not just trying to discount anybodyÂ  Toronto has been playing some good basketball as of late, especially after the tradeÂ  They brought in some really, really key components coming off the bench and they have a good team.",
        "2": "Can I elaborate on it?",
        "3": "Yeah, Kareem.",
        "4": "Kareem and KobeÂ  Those are two guys that came to my mindÂ  It's hard to knock anybody offÂ  I mean, there needs to be another mountain builtÂ  There's too many guysÂ  I definitely was thinking about Kobe as a top four of all time, thinking about Kareem for sureÂ  I mean, there's so many greats that played this game.",
        "5": "Carmelo, Blake, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, to name a few.",
        "6": "If they have one of those monster games, for sureÂ  For sure, I definitely, I had to send out an Instagram post when Melo put up that Madison Square Garden record 62Â  That was pretty exciting.",
        "7": "Well, it shouldÂ  It shouldÂ  As a competitor and as a basketball player you can't wait for your next game to see if you may have one of those hot hands or one of those zones.",
        "8": "No, I haven't thought about it.",
        "9": "That's never come up as a questionÂ  I honestly thought about it a few times, but I didn't give no second guess about it.",
        "10": "I don't knowÂ  I've met so many greatsÂ  I've had the pleasure of meeting Jayâ€‘Z when I was 16 years old and now he's like a big brother of mineÂ  I talk to him on a daily basis or weekly basis, you know, that's pretty cool.",
        "11": "I think he deserves to be hereÂ  20 plus, 10 plus, league leading three and a half plus blocksÂ  Those are Allâ€‘Star caliber numbersÂ  And he's going to continue to get better and betterÂ  I mean, every game you can see him continue to improveÂ  And as long as he stays healthy, I think that's for all of us we all stay healthy, we can all do special thingsÂ  But I think New Orleans has a great one in Anthony Davis.",
        "12": "How sick am I?Ã‚Â  I don't mind itÂ  I mean, you're always going to be linked to somebodyÂ  Early in my career I was linked to KobeÂ  And now I'm linked to KDÂ  You are always going to be linked to somebodyÂ  And it's how you handle itÂ  I don't really get caught up into it too much.",
        "13": "Does it motivate me to what?",
        "14": "I don't think I'm compared to himÂ  They don't compare me to KD, they just talk about the two best players in the game and which one is better, which one can score better, who is the MVP, who is going to win the next championshipÂ  But they don't ever compare our games too much, we're two different players.

        "1": "Can you talk about stepping outside, hitting the five threesÂ  What did you see that led you to do that?Ã‚Â  When you're making shots like that, you're totally unstoppableÂ  I'm sure you would agree.",
        "2": "LeBron, three straight Finals tripsÂ  Two straight championshipsÂ  Do you guys feel like you're just starting to scratch the surface of the potential of this thing?",
        "3": "LeBron, you were drafted ten years ago this weekÂ  Can you put in perspective the improvement you've made as a playerÂ  And was that on display tonight?",
        "4": "LeBron, you have probably taken two, maybe three weeks off since you came out of the cave after the 2011 FinalsÂ  How is it possible thatâ€‘â€‘ you haven't really complained about it either, with the whole thing on your shoulders you come up with 37 tonightÂ  How is that possible even for you?",
        "5": "Do you know when the next time you're going to touch a ball will be?Ã‚Â  Have you thought about some of the other stuff you have going on this summer?",
        "6": "LeBron, with regard to the last two games, defensively, Tony Parker had gotten away from you guysÂ  What did you do in the last two games as a teamâ€‘â€‘ because you ended up on him a lotâ€‘â€‘ to shut him down and corral him?",
        "7": "LeBron, so many people are saying this was tougher, but everybody always says the first one is the toughestÂ  Was this tougher for you?Ã‚Â  And what made itâ€‘â€‘",
        "8": "What did it mean to see Dwyane come out, do what he did early, aggressive, even waving you off at the half to make that last shot.",
        "9": "LeBron, you've won it all now for two years in a rowÂ  What's the goal now for your career going forward?Ã‚Â  Where do you want to go from here?",
        "10": "So what do you do to reward yourself now?Ã‚Â  Because that was one of the most grueling stretches the last month of the season, postseason, that anyone has ever seenÂ  What do you do to reward yourself?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It feels greatÂ  This team is amazingÂ  And the vision that I had when I decided to come here is all coming trueÂ  Through adversity, through everything we've been through, we've been able to persevere and to win backâ€‘toâ€‘back championshipsÂ  It's an unbelievable feelingÂ  I'm happy to be part of such a firstâ€‘class organization.",
        "1": "Yeah, I amÂ  (Laughter)Â  You said itÂ  I mean, twoâ€‘andâ€‘aâ€‘half games I watched film, and my mind started to work and I said, okay, this is how they're going to play me for the whole seriesÂ  I looked at all my regularâ€‘season stats, all my playoff stats, and I was one of the best midâ€‘range shooters in the gameÂ  I shot a career high from the threeâ€‘point line. I just told myself why â€‘â€‘ don't abandon what you've done all yearÂ  Don't abandon now because they're going underÂ  Don't force the paintÂ  If it's there, take itÂ  If not, take the jumperÂ  And I think the lastâ€‘â€‘ I did a good job in Game 4Â  Didn't make as many shots I would like to from the outside in Game 5, but I kept on getting into the rhythm of it. Just saying everything you've worked on, the repetition, the practices, the offâ€‘season training, no matter how big the stakes are, no matter what's on the line, just go with itÂ  And I was able to do that.",
        "2": "I hope soÂ  I hope soÂ  I mean, this is what it's all aboutÂ  I came here to win championships and to be able to go back to backÂ  Two championships in three years so farÂ  It's the ultimateÂ  I don't want to think about next year right now, what our possibilities are next yearÂ  Got to take full advantage of this oneÂ  It's an unbelievable moment for our team.",
        "3": "I mean, I said before the series that I was a better player than I was last time I faced the SpursÂ  Didn't look that way the first couple of gamesÂ  But I stuck with itÂ  Through all that adversity and throughout, I guess, the rhythm that I was in at that point, I just kept goingÂ  Just trusted all the work that I put into my gameÂ  And to be able to come through for your teammates, for me, I thinkâ€‘â€‘ you know more than anybody how much I care about my teammates and hate letting my teammates downÂ  To be able to come through for my teammates in the biggest moment on the biggest stage makes me more satisfied than anything in the world.",
        "4": "The saying \"hard work pays off\" is a true testament of what happened tonightÂ  I know I'm not the only one that works hardÂ  Give a lot of credit, first of allâ€‘â€‘ I forgot to state that at the beginningâ€‘â€‘ to the San Antonio SpursÂ  Firstâ€‘class organizationÂ  Firstâ€‘class playersÂ  But to be able to put in the work that I've put in since I got out of the cave, like you said, after that Dallas series and for it to pay off like this, it's the ultimateÂ  It makes you want to work even harder. I guarantee myself I'll take more than twoâ€‘andâ€‘aâ€‘half weeks off this offseasonÂ  I need it.",
        "5": "I have a basketball camp in Las VegasÂ  The top 100 highâ€‘school kids from July 5th to the 9thÂ  Hopefully I don't see many of you guysÂ  I don't mind seeing you guys, by the wayÂ  I probably will touch a basketball to mess around a little bitÂ  But I don't know, I haven't set my goals yet for my offseason trainingÂ  I will, but not right nowÂ  Please don't ask me about my offseason training right now.",
        "6": "Just pressureÂ  Trying to keep a body on him at all timesÂ  I think more than anything, having guys back in transitionÂ  I think we all know, if you watch the NBA over the last ten years, Tony Parker is always in the topâ€‘â€‘ I don't knowâ€‘â€‘ five, ten at points in the paintÂ  It comes from early transition buckets and also comes from halfcourt sets when guys are just not alert. So our number one key with Tony Parker was when the ball went up, made or misses, we had to get three guys backÂ  The guy that was guarding him, the big and another guy to see bodies, because if it's oneâ€‘onâ€‘one with Tony Parker, he's going to make you payÂ  He's going to make you payÂ  And the simple fact that we just keyed in on our details defensively, it helped us out a lot.",
        "7": "Last year when I was sitting up here, with my first championship, I said it was the toughest thing I had ever doneÂ  This year I'll tell last year he's absolutely wrongÂ  This was the toughest championship right here, between the twoÂ  I mean, everything that we've been throughout this postseason, especially in these Finals, to be downâ€‘â€‘ we were down every odd gameÂ  We were down 1â€‘0Â  We tied itÂ  We were able to take a lead, but then we were downÂ  We were downâ€‘â€‘ we were scratching for our lives in Game 6 down five with 28 seconds to go. To be able to win that game and force a Game 7 is a true testament of our, I guess, perseveranceÂ  And us being able to handle adversity throughout everythingÂ  It meant a lot for us to be able to do that and force a Game 7 and being able to close out at home.",
        "8": "RightÂ  He was bigâ€‘time tonightÂ  He didn't waitÂ  He had I think five or six oneâ€‘onâ€‘one iso situations, jumpersÂ  He was in attack mode all nightÂ  He had 10 reboundsÂ  He had 23 pointsÂ  He had two blocked shots. I think one of the most important plays of the game, that he didn't even make, was his attack at the rim when he tried to dunk on Tim Duncan, and Tim Duncan got a piece of itÂ  It just showed at that point you knew that this was the Dâ€‘Wade that we've all wanted to see. What can you say?Ã‚Â  He's a threeâ€‘time champion, gold medalist, Finals MVPÂ  He's one of the greatest twoâ€‘guards, one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seenÂ  He continues to add to his rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©.",
        "9": "I mean, I have a few goalsÂ  My goal, one of my first goals is to continue to inspire the youth to want to play this game of basketball or to be better at whatever they doÂ  I mean, I love kidsÂ  Hopefully tonight I was able to inspire a lotÂ  Inspire millions toâ€‘â€‘ no matter what they've gone through in their lives at that point in time, they can always overcome itÂ  That's the first thing. Second thing for me is to continue to lead my teammatesÂ  Every single day in practice, every single day in film sessions, I know the grass isn't always green and there's going to be trials and tribulationsÂ  But hopefully I can continue to be the leader for my teammates. And then lastly, I want to be, if not the greatest, one of the greatest to ever play this gameÂ  And I will continue to work for that, and continue to put on this uniform and be the best I can be every night.",
        "10": "I need to rest my bodyÂ  I doÂ  As much as I love working out and as much as I love getting better, at this point I think the smartest thing to do is to rest my bodyÂ  Give my body a breakÂ  I think that's the smartest thingÂ  I got a wedding coming up with my beautiful fiancÃƒÂ©eÂ  And it will be an unbelievable wedding now that we've won, instead of losingÂ  I might have called it off if we lost (laughter). So now it's going to be one of the best weddings everÂ  I'm going to sign off with thatÂ  And I will see you guys when I see you guysÂ  And please continue to motivate meÂ  I need you guysÂ  Thank you.

        "1": "LeBron, can you talk about just your upcoming moment tomorrowÂ  Are you antsy, excited, nervous about the situation where the whole spotlight primarily will be on you?",
        "2": "I saw the way you walked off last night from hereÂ  How does your body feel now?Ã‚Â  What do you do over the next 30 hours or so to get ready?",
        "3": "LeBron, you had I think it was 14 or 16 points in the paint in the fourth quarter and in overtime in that game, which is more than you had any game this seriesÂ  Was that your aggressiveness or something they allowed you to do there as well?",
        "4": "LeBron, when a team loses, especially losing a heartbreaker as the Spurs did last night, you often walk away with the plays still replaying in your head, things that went wrongÂ  Is it the same thing with a win in that fashion?Ã‚Â  Were you leaving last night with that replaying?",
        "5": "LeBron, have you chosen to accept at this point that no matter if you win one title or a bunch more after last year, criticism is always going to be there and it's always going to be really intense when it comes to you?",
        "6": "You often speak of your knowledge and appreciation for history of the gameÂ  There's not many franchises in your lifetime that have gone back to backÂ  Have you been able to avoid thinking about what that would mean tomorrow night?",
        "7": "LeBron, first off, do you go back to the headband tomorrow or do you leave it?",
        "8": "Obviously you're on the court playing, but do you sometimes get an appreciation for what you guys put the fans through from an anxiety standpoint?",
        "9": "A lot of fans left with 30 seconds left and tried to get back into the arena.",
        "10": "LeBron, you talked about it, everybody talked about how much more aggressive you were in the fourth quarterÂ  And people say, why wasn't he like that in the first three quarters?Ã‚Â  Talk about your mindset in the game and answer that question.",
        "11": "LeBron, you can't control the opinions about this team, but just for you and what you set out to accomplish when you came here, do you need this championship in your mind to validate your guys' decision to team up and what you tried to create here?",
        "12": "LeBron, you talked last night about you were going to go down firing all your bulletsÂ  When you're in a situation like that, how does the mode change?Ã‚Â  Is it like a switch, boom?Ã‚Â  And when you get in a mode like that, I imagine you feel that nobody can stop you.",
        "13": "Also no road team has won a Game 7 in The Finals in 35 yearsÂ  How much of an advantage do you feel now being at home in Game 7?",
        "14": "LeBron, given how important the next 30â€‘something hours are and what you know about yourself and what makes you at your best, explain how you will try to prepare yourself mentally for that moment so you are at your very bestÂ  Is it lightâ€‘hearted?Ã‚Â  Is it serious?Ã‚Â  Is it a combination?",
        "15": "Will you play the game out mentally at any point between now and the start?"

        "0": "My rookie year preseasonÂ  I started the preseason off not playingâ€‘â€‘ I think we were in Detroit in my rookie yearÂ  I didn't play too wellÂ  I didn't like it.",
        "1": "I already know thatÂ  It is what it isÂ  I understand the moment for meÂ  I've been pretty relaxed, thoughÂ  I've been pretty relaxed throughout the playoffsÂ  I'm going to be antsy, I'm going to be excitedÂ  I'm going to have some butterfliesÂ  I'll be nervousÂ  EverythingÂ  That's how I should be. The moment is going to be grandÂ  Like I said, I'm happy to be a part of it.",
        "2": "I feel better today than I did last night alreadyÂ  So I'm going to do my extensive treatmentÂ  Do whatever it takesâ€‘â€‘ if I have to play 49 minutes again tomorrow night to help us win, I'm going to do itÂ  Nobody's body is feeling great at this point from both teamsÂ  But for me it's all aboutâ€‘â€‘ it's more mind over matter, manÂ  I'm hurtingÂ  But it doesn't matterÂ  It's the last game of the season, so it's whatever.",
        "3": "It's a little bit of bothÂ  It's also the lineup with myself, Bird, Ray, Rio and Mike, it creates a lot of spaceÂ  With Mike and Ray, they stayed home on those guys a lot, it allows me to get downhill and get to the paintÂ  I started to be more aggressive, I started to find some cracks and able to finish some. But it's a little bit of everythingÂ  Me just trying to be aggressive and put myself in a position where I can succeed to help our team, kind of overcome that 10â€‘point deficit, and I was able to do that.",
        "4": "AbsolutelyÂ  I didn't sleep last night eitherÂ  The Spurs didn't sleepÂ  You probably couldn't sleepÂ  I didn't sleep last night either just thinking about all the plays, the positive plays, the miscues they had, especially for me personally, my turnovers I had late in the gameÂ  I've done that in a few games in the postseason that I'm not too proud about. So I was going through a lot of plays and ways that I know what I can't do in Game 7 if we want to win another championship. So, you know, everything goes through your mind after a gameÂ  It's usually the negatives more than the positives.",
        "5": "YeahÂ  Yeah, it is what it isÂ  That's okayÂ  It won't stop me from loving the game, playing at a high level, doing it for my teammates, putting that uniform on. First of all, I mean, I'm blessed, manÂ  I don't even know how I got hereÂ  I wasn't supposed to be in the NBA, if you go by statistics and things of me growing up where I grew upÂ  Every time I go into my locker room and see the \"James\" on the back of an NBA jersey, I'm like wow, no criticism can deter me from playing this game because of thatÂ  I'm not supposed to be hereÂ  The fact that I'm doing what I'm doing and doing it for my teammates, it's all that matters.",
        "6": "I thought about it for sureÂ  It's human natureÂ  I want to go down as one of the greatestÂ  I want our team to go down as one of the greatest teamsÂ  And we have an opportunity to do that. Hasn't been many peoples to win backâ€‘toâ€‘back championshipsÂ  It's so hardÂ  It's the hardest thingÂ  I said last year it was the hardest thing I've ever done, winning my firstÂ  Last year don't even come close to what we've gone through in this postseason and in these Finals. So I'll be there tomorrow nightÂ  I'm going to give it my allÂ  I'm going to leave everything on the floorÂ  Whatever happens happensÂ  I'll be satisfied with that.",
        "7": "(Laughing)Ã‚Â  I'll probably start off with it, manÂ  A little superstitiousÂ  If it gets knocked off, then me and him will have a discussion if he will return.",
        "8": "Oh, man.",
        "9": "Oh, man, absolutelyÂ  I just know in my household, my wife was like, \"Would you please stop doing that to me?\"Ã‚Â  My motherâ€‘inâ€‘law, even my sons, they were like, \"oh, my GodÂ  You guys lost and won at the same time.\" I knowÂ  We knowÂ  I apologize to our fans from last nightÂ  But the game isâ€‘â€‘ that's why the game is played all the way to zeros. As a fan and people watching at home, I know it had toâ€‘â€‘ wow, it had to do a lot to them, both if you were a Spurs fan or a Heat fan or just a general fan of the gameÂ  It definitely brought everything out of you that you probably didn't think you had.",
        "10": "I think opportunities are different from quarter to quarterÂ  My opportunities were more open in the fourth quarter, and I decided to take advantage of itÂ  I started off pretty aggressive last nightÂ  I was able to get to the freeâ€‘throw line earlyÂ  I got a couple of layâ€‘upsÂ  And then I started toâ€‘â€‘ I got out of rhythm, missed a couple of layâ€‘ups, missed a couple of jumpshotsÂ  And offensively as a team we weren't good at allÂ  Especially in the third quarterÂ  So we were all out of rhythm. But in the fourth quarter we were able to find a rhythm with that lineup we hadÂ  I was able to find a rhythmÂ  And I was just trying to be aggressive and trying to will the victory for us to just keep our hopes aliveÂ  Like I said before, I'm just blessed I was able to make a few plays to help us keep going.",
        "11": "I mean, I need it because I want it, and I only came hereâ€‘â€‘ my only goal is to win championshipsÂ  I said it, this is what I came here forÂ  This is what I wanted to be a part of this team for. As far as validation of me being here, I don't reallyâ€‘â€‘ I don't think soÂ  That side doesn't really matter to me about what validates us coming togetherÂ  The camaraderie and the friendship and the teammates and what we've done over the three years can never be replaced. So for that side, noÂ  But I want itÂ  And I'm going to doâ€‘â€‘ I'm not going to cut no cornersÂ  I'm not going to cheat the gameÂ  I'm going to work for itÂ  We're not entitled to win itÂ  We have to work for itÂ  So that's what I'm here for.",
        "12": "YeahÂ  When you get into a rhythm, you do feel like you can't be stoppedÂ  I wasn't perfect last nightÂ  Like I said, I made some critical mistakes that I can't make again if we want to winÂ  But for me when I go out and I play as hard as I played last night or I doâ€‘â€‘ try to make plays what I feel is better for the team or what's best for the team, then I can always be satisfied with the resultsÂ  I was happy with that.",
        "13": "Hey, man, history is always meant to be broken or rewroteÂ  So we can't worry about what the history books sayÂ  That's why it's historyÂ  We have to live in the presentÂ  We have to live in the momentÂ  And we have to do whatever it takes to bring that trophy or to keep that trophy here in Miami.",
        "14": "It's going to be lightâ€‘heartedÂ  I'm going to spend a lot of time tonight with my friends and family, like I always do the night before a gameÂ  We're going to laugh and joke about things that has happened in the pastÂ  Got a few of my highâ€‘school teammates, friends, my best friends in townÂ  My two boys are hereÂ  So they're not going to let me be too seriousÂ  They're going to make me watch Sponge Bob or something at 9:00Â  You like that?Ã‚Â  That little kid likes that. It's going to be lightâ€‘hearted around the house, manÂ  That's what keeps meâ€‘â€‘ it keeps meâ€‘â€‘ you don't want to think about the game too muchÂ  I understand it's a huge gameÂ  It's probably going to be one of the biggest games, if not the biggest game, of my lifeÂ  But I'm going to just keep it the same way I've been doing, and tomorrow night I'll be able to focus in about on the job at hand.",
        "15": "Oh, the gameâ€‘â€‘ absolutelyÂ  I imagine that if I fall asleepÂ  If I get any sleep tonight, it will be played in my head, us winningÂ  It's happened all postseasonÂ  While I'm up, I'm going to think about ways I can help the team, certain situations, certain plays that I can get better with. I will play Game 7 in my head from now until tomorrow nightÂ  It's just who I am, how I amÂ  But I won't be too seriousÂ  I won't go into a bunker when I get back homeÂ  But I will be mentally sharp, mentally focused and mentally driven tomorrow night. And IÃ‚â€™m getting up better than last night (laughter) FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you lost your headband early in the fourth quarterÂ  You and the team both responded with a big runÂ  Can you talk about how that moment might have energized the team from that point.",
        "1": "LeBron, what do you remember about that play?Ã‚Â  And I know it's not a big deal, it's your headbandÂ  What do you remember about that play and your decision to not go with it from then on?",
        "2": "LeBron, Chris Bosh said after the game this was maybe the best Finals game he's ever seen in person or on TV, whateverÂ  Put it in perspective how exciting this game was, and how dramatic was it among games you've played in and all that.",
        "3": "LeBron, Chris said in the locker room that he saw the yellow tape going around the arena and it quote \"pissed him off.\"Ã‚Â  Did you notice that?Ã‚Â  And just go through your emotions in the last few minutes of the game.",
        "4": "LeBron, you made the three that got it within two and then on the possession Rayâ€‘â€‘ you missed the first threeÂ  When Chris got the rebound, you were screaming for the ballÂ  You were jumpingÂ  Your arms were up in the airÂ  Did you think Ray was going to take the shot or did you want to take that shot?",
        "5": "Everybody looked tired down the stretchÂ  What role did fatigue play in this game?",
        "6": "LeBron, you had been on the other end of a lot of Ray's threes in the pastÂ  Talk about what you remember when you guys acquired himÂ  And also how much recruiting did you do to try to get him here?",
        "7": "What exactly do you recall from that play, the broken play?",
        "8": "LeBron, I don't think maybe even you would admit we have not seen that great team we saw in the regular season yet, but I know you have a great opponent hereÂ  Do you feel like you are at all lucky or fortunate that you've made it this far to a Game 7 with a chance to win on your home court with the way that you've played?",
        "9": "LeBron, in the third quarter I think you were 3â€‘forâ€‘11Â  The team was down by 13 pointsÂ  You're playing a team with a championship pedigreeÂ  Talk about what happened just inside of you and the will that you drew upon to turn that thing aroundÂ  Take us inside what's that's like.",
        "10": "What made it the greatest game that you've ever been a part of?",
        "11": "LeBron, you just said that fourth quarter you got into this kind of desperation modeÂ  What do you guys need to do to start the same thing quarter No. 1 for Game 7, the same intensity?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We just played with a lot of energyÂ  We defended at a higher level and allowed us to get back into the game.",
        "1": "I don't even remember the play muchÂ  I was just focused on the job, the task at hand, and just trying to be aggressive, just trying to figure out ways I could help the team get back into the gameÂ  And you know, I guess the headband was the least of my worries at that point.",
        "2": "It was by far the best game I've ever been a part ofÂ  The ups and downs, the roller coaster, the emotions, good and bad throughout the whole gameÂ  To be a part of something like this is something you would never be able to recreate once you're done playing the gameÂ  And I'm blessed to be a part of something like thisÂ  And I'm happy about the way we dug down and was able to get a winÂ  It didn't look like we could muster up at some point in the game.",
        "3": "Yeah, I noticed itÂ  It kind of did the same to all of usÂ  There's a few guys in the locker room that talked about itÂ  We seen the championship board already out there, the yellow tapeÂ  And you know, that's why you play the game, to the final buzzerÂ  And that's what we did tonightÂ  We gave it everything that we had and moreÂ  And to come out with a win like that, it makes it even more greater, when you're able to, I guess, just will everything that you have as individuals for a team and have a game like this.",
        "4": "If it's not me taking the shot, I have no problem with Ray take that shot, manÂ  He's got ice water in his veinsÂ  Ray canâ€‘â€‘ like I said, Ray can be 0â€‘forâ€‘99 in a game and if he get an open look late in the game, it's going downÂ  That's just the confidence he have in himselfÂ  It's the preparation that he prepares for every gameÂ  It's the confidence that we have in himÂ  We seen it beforeÂ  We seen it before. We're happy to have him on our sideÂ  And this is the reason why we wanted him in games like this.",
        "5": "I mean, fatigue is a part of the gameÂ  You've got two teams that's fighting for an NBA championshipÂ  Not only are they going all the way taking the tank all the way down to E, they're also using their reserve tank. But I don't think fatigue played a part in the gameÂ  I think both teams had a will to winÂ  We just made one more play at the end of the day.",
        "6": "I did a lotÂ  I called him, texted himÂ  I just knew what he could bring to our teamÂ  Just like you said, I've been on the other end of seeing him get them feet down, putting them stupid two fingers after he make the shotÂ  Not so stupid anymore now that he's my teammate; I love it. He's bigâ€‘timeÂ  He's bigâ€‘timeÂ  We loveâ€‘â€‘ we're so happy to have him, manÂ  He creates so much for our teamÂ  And to have someone as dangerous as that on our roster, man, it means so much.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, it wasn't too much of a broken playÂ  We ran a great setÂ  I came over, got a great look. Ã‚Â CB made some unbelievable plays tonightÂ  He got the offensive reboundÂ  Hit Ray, and once Ray got them feet down, I seen it in the air and I was like \"It's going inÂ  It got a chanceÂ  It's going in.\"Ã‚Â  And he drained it. Just gave us another life.",
        "8": "I think luck plays a part, of courseÂ  But at the end of the day, we're out there busting our tails to makeâ€‘â€‘ to put ourself in a position to have a little luckÂ  But at the end of the day we have a Game 7 on our floor to win the NBA championship. So I really don't care how the hell we done played so farÂ  (Laughing)Â  We could have played the worst six games of our lives, but we got a Game 7 on our floorÂ  So Thursday is for all the marbles.",
        "9": "I was struggling shooting the ballÂ  We were strugglingÂ  And they took a commanding 12â€‘point lead to start the fourthÂ  After we came out before we entered the ball, I basically just told myself, give it all I gotÂ  If we go down losing, I'm going to go down with no bulletsÂ  I'm going all outÂ  I can be satisfied with the results. That's exactly what I didÂ  I just tried to play both sides of the floor on a highâ€‘intense level until I had no more left in the tankÂ  Looked at Spo a few timesÂ  Told him I need a timeout, so I can get a restÂ  And just go back on the floor and try to make plays happenÂ  Just try to do whatever it takes for our team to win, manÂ  And that's what it's about.",
        "10": "I just think the emotionsÂ  The emotions, the ups and downs, us being up, us being downÂ  I think more than anything just our mental toughnessÂ  Our mental toughness to make it almost look like the game was out of our hands, and to come through victoriousÂ  And to be a part of something like this, like I said, once you're done playing this game, you would never be able to recreate a feeling like I had, we had, the fans had, you guys had, people at homeÂ  Never be able to recreate thatÂ  I'm just blessed I could be a part of such an unbelievable moment.",
        "11": "I thought we did a better job in quarter one today of coming out with a sense of urgencyÂ  I think Tim Duncan, he was amazing in the first quarterÂ  They made some tough shotsÂ  But we still had a twoâ€‘point lead. It was the second quarter that really killed usÂ  We got outscored by eight in that quarterÂ  And in the third quarter we got outscored by four. If we come out â€‘â€‘ at the end of the day, it's the last game of the seasonÂ  It's the last game of the seasonÂ  You have to muster up all the energy that you might haveÂ  It's not about X's and O's at this pointÂ  They know what we're runningÂ  We know what they're runningÂ  We know their personnelÂ  They know our personnelÂ  It's about getting stops defensively, staying in it mentally, not turning the ball over, and making a few shots. The best team will be crowned Thursday nightÂ  Thank you. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "1": "For both of you:Ã‚Â  You have no choice but to say yes now because of the card you've been dealt, but if you got told way back two games at home to win this thing, do you take it?",
        "3": "LeBron?",
        "4": "LeBron, after Game 3 when you guys lost here, you specifically said you had to play betterÂ  You were pretty good tonightÂ  Is this on you?Ã‚Â  Is this game right now when you go forwardâ€‘â€‘ anything else you could be doing?",
        "5": "How do you keep your focus small and not on the legacy of the implications of all of this?",
        "7": "LeBron, having played with Danny at an early stage in his career, did you ever anticipate that he could do this much damage this late in the series and throughout the series?",
        "8": "LeBron, you had been asked about why this team has been unable to win two games in a row, and you said, \"Now is the timeÂ  Now is the time.\"Ã‚Â  Why have the Heat been unable to win two games in a row?",
        "10": "LeBron and Dwyane, talk about how important it is for both of you guys to reestablish your individual offense inside the paint in Game 6.",
        "11": "Ray Allen found his shot again in Game 6Â  How does that help you in Game 6?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "AbsolutelyÂ  That's the position we're inÂ  The most important game is Game 6Â  We can't worry about a Game 7Â  We have to worry about Game 6 and going back home, being confident about our game, being confident about getting a win, which we are. So it is what it isÂ  We have a Game 6 on our home floor.",
        "3": "He said itÂ  He said itÂ  We're going to see if we're a better team than we were our first year together.",
        "4": "I have to come up big, for sure in Game 6Â  But I believe we all have to play at a high level in order to keep the series goingÂ  So me being one of the leaders of this team, I do put a lot of pressure on myself to force a Game 7, and I look forward to the challenge.",
        "5": "I always kind of focus on the presentÂ  And for us the next challenge is Tuesday nightÂ  We will get better tomorrowÂ  We're going to watch film, see ways we can clean up our starts, especially our first quarterÂ  We're not playing well in the first quarterÂ  We have to figure that out. But our next challenge, biggest challenge will be Tuesday nightÂ  We have an opportunity on our home floor with our home fans to keep the series going, and we look forward to it.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, for me I think opportunity is everythingÂ  Pop gave him an opportunityÂ  He's trying to seize the moment, and he's doing great for his team so far.",
        "8": "If I knew the answer we would have won two games in a rowÂ  I don't knowÂ  Just haven't been able to do it.",
        "10": "I think that's where it starts for us, honestlyÂ  Getting into the paintÂ  I think between the two of us, we probably missed 12 layâ€‘ups tonightÂ  Transition layâ€‘ups that we usually convertÂ  I missed a lobÂ  I missed two layâ€‘upsÂ  Transition on the same possessionÂ  I know Dâ€‘Wade had a few layâ€‘ups that we're accustomed to makingÂ  Those are points in the paint that we weren't able to convert which we are not worried aboutÂ  Those are shots we makeÂ  And maybe it would be a different turnout at that point.",
        "11": "Ray is a big part of our teamÂ  So when he's on the floor, he's a threatÂ  We try to find him."

      "questions": {
        "0": "Hey, LeBronÂ  Danny Green was talking about when he was your teammate in '09â€‘'10 with Cleveland, some of the rookie chores he did for the team and what have youÂ  What do you remember about maybe things you had him do that season or other veterans had him do?",
        "1": "How impressed are you or surprised, however you want to phrase it, with how Danny has played in this series?",
        "2": "LeBron, with your ability to recall plays, coverages, that kind of thing, how far does that go back?Ã‚Â  When do you remember that beginning to happen for you?Ã‚Â  And then how does it help you today either in preparation, practice or in games?",
        "3": "I guess how far back does the memory go, but at what point in your career do you remember being able to do that?Ã‚Â  And do you do it more in practice than in games?",
        "4": "LeBron, the game that you and Chris and Dwyane had last game, why hasn't that been more commonplace this season?",
        "5": "What has been the biggest challenge of you guys trying to make it work?",
        "6": "LeBron, worstâ€‘case scenario obviously is that you go home with homeâ€‘court advantage on Tuesday night, and theoretically where the series is supposed to be, worstâ€‘case scenarioÂ  That all being said, you look at Game 5 as needing the same urgency, the same intensity as Game 4, the same attitude as when you were down in the series?",
        "7": "Are you surprised at allâ€‘â€‘ Game 1 was such a classic, great finishÂ  Obviously not the way you would have wanted it, of course, but are you surprised that the last three games have all been 19, 30â€‘something, something else that we haven't seen the closer games in this series?",
        "8": "A little off the track, it's Father's Day tomorrowÂ  I know Bryce turned six this week, I guessÂ  Are your kids of the age now that they understand this time of year is different for you?Ã‚Â  That the moment is different than the regular season?",
        "9": "So they came out with you for this entire week or just during the weekend?",
        "10": "LeBron, your confidence and your body language and selfâ€‘assuredness just kind of is completely different now than it was 2011Â  Just that mindset, how important is that going into a pressureâ€‘packed situation like Game 5?",
        "11": "Is that something that you have to just learn by going through the pain?",
        "12": "LeBron, if you look at the Dallas series, the Oklahoma series and even this series, there seems to be a big difference in Miami's success when you're a perimeter facilitator versus someone who looks to attack and scoreÂ  So what are your thoughts on these next three games, to continue attacking?Ã‚Â  As well assuming San Antonio doesn't concede the wide open perimeter, how do you attack in a halfâ€‘court offense?",
        "13": "Basically, I'm asking are you going to continue to look to score?",
        "14": "NoÂ  I meanâ€‘â€‘",
        "15": "LeBron, your Game 4 turnovers that you forced on them were a little bit differentÂ  And you got into the passing lanes a little bit moreÂ  Does some of that come from the familiarity of playing against a team consistently and starting to understand what they're trying to do and anticipating it?",
        "16": "Last year you won the title for the first timeÂ  Do you watch it sometimes on the tape?",
        "17": "Last year you won for the first time you won the titleÂ  Do you watch it sometimes on the tape on the video?",
        "18": "Yes.",
        "19": "LeBron, is there any similarities between your performance, mentality, to scout Game 4 this year than in Game 6 last year against the Celtics, that whole mentality being locked in?",
        "20": "Going back to the idea these games haven't been close, do you feel like if you guys play the right way that the three of you guys and you force turnovers and hit outside shots, that you should be able to beat this team, that it's not a surprise when the margins gets lopsided?"

        "0": "I really didn't have him do muchÂ  I wasn't really the veteran on the team that made the rookies do stuffÂ  Most of the time it was ShaqÂ  Shaq made him do everything.",
        "1": "I've seen the talent in practice every dayÂ  We would always shoot after practiceÂ  It would be me, him, Mo and Boobie Gibson shooting every day after practiceÂ  I seen his ability to shoot the ballÂ  In practice he would play very wellÂ  I just think he needed an opportunity, and I said that before the seriesÂ  He got a great opportunity here, and he's taking full advantage of it.",
        "2": "I don't remember how far goes backÂ  I can remember plays in situations a couple of years back, a few years backÂ  I don't knowÂ  Sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn'tÂ  Sometimes it can cloud my mind too much and I get to thinking about the game too much instead of just playingÂ  Sometimes I'm able to put myself in situations that's better for me and better for our team by knowing what happened before. I guess it's a gift and a curse.",
        "3": "I've been kind of like this for a whileÂ  Probably since I was in little league, actually, to be able to remember plays that happened out on the floorÂ  But it became important to me probably when I got in high school.",
        "4": "I don't knowÂ  I have no ideaÂ  We would love to do what we did last game every gameÂ  But every game is differentÂ  Every game presents different challengesÂ  We haven't been able to string games like that for the Big Three in this postseasonÂ  But we're still hereÂ  We're still in a position to win an NBA championship, and that's what's most important.",
        "5": "I think year one, it's just the sacrifice we all had to make. Ã‚Â That's the biggest challengeÂ  The sacrifice you have to make to be the face of a franchise, the face of a team and sacrificing everything to be a part of something that's greaterÂ  That's itÂ  Once we figured that out, we've been pretty good ever since.",
        "6": "YeahÂ  I think it's timeÂ  I think we're well overdue when it's time for us to win consecutive gamesÂ  I think we're at 11 or 12 straight consecutive winâ€‘loss, winâ€‘loss, winâ€‘lossÂ  I think it's timeÂ  Enough is enough for our teamÂ  I'm not saying it's going to result in us having a win, but we need to play with the same sense of urgency as if we were down 2â€‘1 or whatever the case may be tomorrow nightÂ  And we can't wait around.",
        "7": "I guess the teams are just making the adjustmentsÂ  The adjustments the teams are making from game to gameÂ  And that's resulted in what's happened in the last two gamesÂ  I think that's what everyone would like, 2â€‘2 in The Finals for Game 5. We are excited about the opportunityÂ  We have another opportunity to win on someone else's floor.",
        "8": "No, not reallyÂ  They don't care eitherÂ  They know if I won or lostÂ  But for the most part, when you have them around, man, it puts everything in perspectiveÂ  Like you said, yesterday was Bryce's six birthdayÂ  He had a great time yesterdayÂ  But all they know is if I won or lostÂ  At the end of the day I love to see their smiles, love to see their energy, and I'm happy to have them.",
        "9": "No, they got here Thursday.",
        "10": "I mean, I think it's just maturity, and if I'm going to be the leader of a team, then I have to be that wayÂ  If the guys are going to believe in me, I can't have doubtÂ  I can't be unsure about thingsÂ  I have to be fully confident, confident in my ability and confident in my teammates and go out there and do it. So I got that not only from myself but my teammates have given me the keys and say, hey, we look to you to lead usÂ  Now it's up to you to go do it.",
        "11": "AbsolutelyÂ  AbsolutelyÂ  You have to go through some painÂ  Doesn't matter if it's at this level or you're a kid or whatever the case may be throughoutÂ  Whatever that you do, I believe you have to go through some pain in order to get to the highest level.",
        "12": "What are you asking?",
        "13": "And not pass?",
        "14": "Let me put it this way:Ã‚Â  We don't make it to Dallas, we don't make it to OKC and we don't make it here if I don't play the way I playÂ  It's that simpleÂ  My game doesn't change no matter who I'm playingÂ  I know I'm an attack playerÂ  I also do multiple thingsÂ  I get my teammates involved, I rebound, I defendÂ  I don't have three straight trips to The Finals if I don't do what I doÂ  It is what it is.",
        "15": "It's about being in the right place at the right timeÂ  Not being too overaggressive, but being in the right placesÂ  We cover for one anotherÂ  We got some blocksÂ  We got some stealsÂ  We got some deflections and allowed us to get in transitionÂ  Against a team like this that's very precise with their offense, turnovers are very keyÂ  They're not going to turn the ball over much, but when we do get turnovers, we try to turn them into transition pointsÂ  And on the other end we don't want to turn the ball over well because they execute so well. So we were in the right place at the right time in Game 4, and hopefully we can put ourselves in the same position in Game 5.",
        "16": "Excuse me?",
        "17": "Last year's Finals?",
        "18": "No, I haven't watched it in a whileÂ  Been pretty busy as of lateÂ  Haven't had a chance.",
        "19": "I put a lot of pressure on myself coming off the Game 3 loss and I had to own up to that and come through for my team in Game 4Â  Like I said, I was blessed to be able to make a few plays to help our team win that gameÂ  I have the same focus and the same mentality coming into Game 5Â  And we'll see what happens.",
        "20": "We're not surprised to get a winÂ  Surprised to win by double digitsÂ  If we play our game, if we force turnovers, we rebound, execute offensively and don't turn the ball over, we can win against anybodyÂ  We're a confident bunchÂ  But we're going against a great team that's going to make adjustments as wellÂ  And that's why it's a 2â€‘2 series right now. So both teams believe they can win on each other's floorÂ  Both teams feel like they can beat the other team up pretty well if they get to their gameÂ  So it's who gets to their game better that particular night and see what happens after that.

        "0": "LeBron, could you just elaborate on how tough the Miami Heat are to beat when the Big Three is clicking the way you guys were tonight?",
        "1": "LeBron, you never get the feel of what Dwyane Wade is going to do some nights, it feels like from outside perspectiveÂ  Do you know something about him?Ã‚Â  And how he could show up on a night like this, when other nights he just looks like a woozy fighter walking down the court.",
        "2": "Is he hurting, do you think, physically?",
        "3": "LeBron, you talked about how you wanted to get out and run, get rebounds, get out in the open floorÂ  You were able to do that pretty much from the beginningÂ  Did you execute your game plan tonight the way that you wanted to?",
        "4": "LeBron, when Spo had to pull you out so you could catch your breath, you looked like you were extremely gassedÂ  How big of a break did you need right there?",
        "5": "LeBron, you've talked a few times this series about shooters need to see the ball go through the basketÂ  You saw it go through the basket the first time midway through the first quarter and then kind of took offÂ  How big was that when Norris Cole hit you with that pass and the bucket and you took off?",
        "6": "LeBron, you guys talk a lot about mustâ€‘wins and coming back when your back is against the wallÂ  Is the next challenge now to try to handle prosperity and put two of these wins together?Ã‚Â  You guys haven't had two consecutive playoff wins in about three weeks.",
        "7": "LeBron, it sounds like what you were saying earlier is you've learned how not to let games snowball on you, bad games snowball on youÂ  Is that something you've just learned over the course of your career?Ã‚Â  And if so, how did you learn that?",
        "8": "LeBron, you know what it is, how it changes your dynamics when one of your Big Three maybe isn't there on a given nightÂ  What have you guys done in terms of the priority on Ginobili to cause him to struggle the way he has in this series?",
        "9": "LeBron, you said the six steals from Dwyane showed you how active he wasÂ  What's the 25 shots show you as well about the activity?Ã‚Â  And secondly, as silly as this sounds, did he almost need to be reminded himself of what he's capable of after all â€‘â€‘"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, it was on our shoulders, obviouslyÂ  We had to figure out to will a game for us, to play at the highest levelÂ  When all three of us are clicking at the same time, we're a very tough team to beat.",
        "1": "Well, he's a competitor, and every time he's down, he respondsÂ  For him to go out there and play the way he played tonight, it was amazingÂ  32, 6 boards, 4 assists, 6 stealsÂ  The 6 steals let me know he's very active both offensively and defensively. He went back in his bag todayÂ  He was Flash tonightÂ  We needed every bit of it.",
        "2": "Yeah, he's hurtingÂ  Of course he's hurtingÂ  He's been playing with a bum knee all yearÂ  He's hurting, but he's not making no excuses about itÂ  A performance like tonight will make you feel better.",
        "3": "We had a game plan, and we played wellÂ  We played well offensively and defensively, and we needed itÂ  We needed everybody, contributions tonight from the starters to the benchÂ  We stuck with the game plan, even as they were making their run in the second quarter and some of the runs they made in the third.",
        "4": "Well, I needed a break a few minutes, for sureÂ  I gave it everything I hadÂ  I was just playing as hard as I could until the tank was emptyÂ  And that's how it's going to have to be for the rest of this seriesÂ  I was just trying to keep my foot on the gas, me personally, and just play till, like I said, until the tank was emptyÂ  That's why we have guys that can come in, when guys get tired, just keep the momentum going.",
        "5": "I just came into the game confidentÂ  Before I even made a shot I came into the game confidentÂ  I knew what my mindset was going to beÂ  I didn't worry about last gameÂ  Last game was historyÂ  And I just worried in the presentÂ  I'm blessed and happy I was able to make a contribution to our win tonight.",
        "6": "That's exactly rightÂ  You said it perfectlyÂ  We can't wait until our back is against the wall every time to respondÂ  We have to build some momentumÂ  And we can use tonight as momentum, but we still have work to do. We still got to get betterÂ  There was some stretches tonight where we didn't play wellÂ  And if we understand and if we own it, we come in with a mindset on Sunday that we are desperate once again, and our back is against the wall. So it's going to be a challenge for us, and we have to be ready for that.",
        "7": "I'm blessed to have, I guess, a next dayÂ  I never went to college, so I never had to worry about if you lose the first one, then it's like I don't have another opportunityÂ  And it's not saying I'm taking the game for granted, I just know there's a tomorrowÂ  And I can't worry about what happened yesterdayÂ  And that's what I've been able to do. As bad as I played in Game 3, I put all the pressure on me to say I can't afford to play like that and hope for us to winÂ  Not at this levelÂ  So I was able to forget about itÂ  It hurtÂ  I watched the filmÂ  It hurt watching itÂ  I didn't like the way I was playingÂ  But I just came in with a whole new clean slate tonight, and like I said, I was blessed to be able to make a few plays to help us win.",
        "8": "He's a bigâ€‘time playerÂ  Against bigâ€‘time players you just try to make it tough on themÂ  That's what we've been trying to doÂ  We've been trying to get high hands on his pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  He's a great passerÂ  When he raises for his threes, we try to get contestsÂ  When he drives the lane, we try to get a body in front of him and contest him at the rim. Sometimes you're lucky, and sometimes you're in the right positionÂ  So it's been a little bit of both.",
        "9": "The 25 shots let me know that he was aggressive, every shot that he tookÂ  He wasn't passiveÂ  He came off, they went under, he shot his jumperÂ  In transition he attacked the rimÂ  He continued to attack throughout the gameÂ  And no matter how great you are, no matter what your rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ© is, to have a game like this, it let's you know that you're still one badâ€‘â€‘ you know the next two wordsÂ  I can't say, my kids may be watching. That dude was amazingÂ  Like I said, he was '06 Flash tonightÂ  And we needed every bit of himÂ  Thanks, guys. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, some of the Spurs players were saying that you're not necessarily struggling offensivelyÂ  They're just playing great defenseÂ  How much of it is you struggling and how much of it is their defense?",
        "1": "When you're going through a difficult patch, do you confide in anybody or do you just figure it out yourself?",
        "2": "Danny Green mentioned last night, I don't know if you heard it, he said he thought they weren't stopping you as much as you were stopping yourselfÂ Ã‚Â  Does any part of that ring true to you that you may be in your own way?",
        "3": "And what would better mean for you?",
        "4": "LeBron, I know you were upset after the game last nightÂ  But do you still have the mindset that it's on you, that you want this on your shoulders, on your chest?",
        "5": "And when you say that, the obvious thing that I think most people would think about is, is it going to be 40 like Indiana or 45 like Boston?Ã‚Â  Can you afford to think of anything in those sort of terms?",
        "6": "You guys have shown an ability to bounce back consistently this seasonÂ  Usually when you do it's in a pretty big wayÂ  Is that just a collective mindset of feeling desperation?",
        "7": "Dwyane said it has to be the Big Three, so to speak, of Miami to lead this team whereas the Spurs are getting more out of their role playersÂ  Do you agree with that sentiment?",
        "8": "LeBron, as much as we all know you can take it on, this was supposed to be three great players doing this together in MiamiÂ  The other two aren't really playing that well eitherÂ  Are you kind of discounting that they can pick it up?",
        "9": "LeBron, obviously you guys have a lot of will and a lot of pride when it goes to responding to lossesÂ  The San Antonio Spurs have four championships, tooÂ  They know what it's like to play in this moment as well.",
        "10": "You said 7â€‘forâ€‘21 won't cut itÂ  No free throws won't cut itÂ  Is it tough to make that kind of adjustment in the game?",
        "11": "LeBron, you had by far your best season from the perimeter shooting this year from three and inside the threeÂ  You said you're not in a rhythm right nowÂ  Does the ball feel good coming out of your hands?",
        "12": "LeBron, what bothered you most about the team's defensive effort?Ã‚Â  And secondly, what has allowed you guys in the playoffs to bounce back with such huge wins after losses?",
        "13": "LeBron, are you more disappointed that you didn't get to the freeâ€‘throw line, that you were settling, or the fact that their defense is kind of throwing you off your game?",
        "14": "LeBron, you said a number of times that you'll be better and that you will figure it outÂ  What is it that gives you that confidence to know that that will be the case?",
        "15": "Some people when they watch you play, the people that analyze these things, they say, he just has to goÂ  He has to impose his willÂ  He has to just get to the basketÂ  What don't those people understand about what you're facing?",
        "16": "How much of what's been going on in The Finals and last night is in your head?",
        "17": "Last night, just your struggles in general the last couple of games, how much of that is in your head?",
        "18": "I see what you meanÂ  What I mean is last night, how much of that was in your head?",
        "19": "LeBron, you've seen every defense over the yearsÂ  You've seen teams try to build a wall against youÂ  But in this particular instance would getting the ball on the move as opposed to a static screenâ€‘andâ€‘roll be a better way for you to attack the defense?",
        "20": "One other thing:Ã‚Â  Their ability to go from strong to weak passing the ball, moving the ball, is that leading to Leonard being as active as he is on the glass, kind of stretching you guys out a little bit?",
        "21": "LeBron, you mentioned you'll figure it out or you always figure it outÂ  We've seen that through the yearsÂ  What else have you figured out that you need to do?",
        "22": "You talked about there's getting the ball on the moveÂ  What else have you figured out against their defense that you need to do?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Some of it bothÂ  They're doing a great job of putting bodies in front of me and not allowing me to have some of the creases I have had throughout the playoffsÂ  Some of it is me being out of rhythmÂ  It's a little bit of both.",
        "1": "No, I figure it out.",
        "2": "I'll be betterÂ  I'll be much better tomorrow night.",
        "3": "Better than last nightÂ  I played like (expletive).",
        "4": "YeahÂ  AbsolutelyÂ  I take full responsibility for our team's performance last nightÂ  Me as a leader, I can't afford to perform like I did last night and expect us to win on the roadÂ  It's that simple. So I'm putting all the pressure on my chest, on my shoulders to come through for our teamÂ  That's the way it is.",
        "5": "I have to do whatever it takesÂ  I mean, 7â€‘forâ€‘21 isn't going to cut itÂ  Zero free throwsÂ  I had 11 rebounds, I had 5 assists, but 7â€‘forâ€‘21 and zero free throws ain't going to cut it. So I will be better tomorrow.",
        "6": "We've been at our best when I guess our backs are up against the wallÂ  And we're at it again. We'll see how we respond tomorrow.",
        "7": "We have to have a collective group to win, especially against this teamÂ  And everyone has to perform at a high level.",
        "8": "No, I'm not discounting anyoneÂ  We wouldn't be at this point without my teammatesÂ  I have all the confidence in the world in my teammatesÂ  But I am the star, I am the leaderÂ  And they look at me to do things on the court, to make plays, and if I'm not doing it, I'm not doing my job.",
        "9": "AbsolutelyÂ  We'll see what happensÂ  Something has to give tomorrow nightÂ  They have a championship pedigreeÂ  They have fourÂ  We have twoÂ  So something has to giveÂ  We'll see what happens. We've been able to bounce back throughout adverse times throughout the season throughout the years that we've been together, these three yearsÂ  We'll see.",
        "10": "You can't have both of themÂ  If you can go 7â€‘forâ€‘21, but you get to the freeâ€‘throw line tenâ€‘plus times, you're being aggressiveÂ  You have to be able to shoot the ball high clip from the field if you're not going to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  You can't have both. It's impossible for me to go 7â€‘forâ€‘21, shoot 33% from the field and not have free throwsÂ  You have to figure out ways offensively that you can make an impact.",
        "11": "At times it hasÂ  Last night a few of them didÂ  A few of them didn'tÂ  But I know, I've shot the ballâ€‘â€‘ my rhythm, I've been in good rhythm all yearÂ  I've worked on it enough. Mentally it's not a problemÂ  Mentally I'm not out of it, saying that my shot is goneÂ  I know what I can doÂ  It's just about going up there and knocking them downÂ  I will do that.",
        "12": "19 offensive rebounds, 20 points in transition for the SpursÂ  I don't knowÂ  It's just something we've grown over the years, being able to bounce back in adverse situationsÂ  And no matter the circumstances, this is going to be probably one of the toughest, because this isâ€‘â€‘ like you said, we're going against a team championship DNA and championship pedigree on the floor and a mustâ€‘winÂ  We're going to be ready for itÂ  We're going to accept the challenge and see what happens.",
        "13": "I don't believe I was settlingÂ  I think I took the shots that was thereÂ  I had some really good looks that didn't go downÂ  But I just didn't get to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  I can't allow that to happenÂ  I have to try to put more pressure on the defenseÂ  Not saying the whistle is going to be blown, putting pressure on their defensive interior and for myself to kick it out for my guys to have to do thatÂ  That's what I was brought here to doÂ  And it can't be anything less than that.",
        "14": "I'm just confident in my abilityÂ  And my teammates are going to put me in positions to succeedÂ  And the coaching staff will put us in positions to succeed. I'm a positive guyÂ  I love the gameÂ  I have fun with the gameÂ  As dark as it was last night, can't get no darker than that, especially for me. So I guarantee I'll be better tomorrow for sure.",
        "15": "I don't knowÂ  I don't know what they don't understandÂ  I guess they're not on the floorÂ  But for me, I don't really get involved in what people say that I should doÂ  I just do what I need to do to help our team winÂ  I can't worry about what guys are saying or writingÂ  I don't really get involved in it.",
        "16": "Is in my head?Ã‚Â  Right now?",
        "17": "Well, I'm better today than I was last night, obviously.",
        "18": "I mean, if you see my comments and you see my interview, it'll let you know it was weighing heavily on me, right after getting blown out in a Finals gameÂ  So it was weighing heavily on meÂ  With my performance, I didn't particularly care for myself at that point in timeÂ  So obviously it was in my head.",
        "19": "I think that's one wayÂ  Another way is for us to getâ€‘â€‘ we have to get stops, tooÂ  And defensive rebounding, where I'm getting the ball off the backboard and trying to create some early offense instead of playing against their halfâ€‘court defense. But, yeah, I may use that adjustmentÂ  Thanks, DavidÂ  Appreciate itÂ  My man.",
        "20": "He's doing something they haven't done this yearÂ  They're 29th in offensive rebounding this yearÂ  And Kawhi has found a way toâ€‘â€‘ I think he's made an adjustment to get offensive reboundsÂ  So it's part of my job, tooÂ  It's part of my job, tooÂ  I'm matched up with him a lotÂ  I get caught sometimes trying to help out our bigs and reboundingÂ  He's coming in flying in â€‘â€‘ when I'm helping out with our bigs, he's coming in and getting rebounds. I think in Game 2 he had eight offensive rebounds in Game 2Â  He had a couple last night as wellÂ  That's part of my job, tooÂ  I'm okay with that.",
        "21": "Specifically what do you mean?",
        "22": "Well, I mean, I think first of all, I think David said it well, getting the ball on the moveÂ  Get some early offenseÂ  Not playing against their set defense as muchÂ  They're doing a good job of when I come off pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls, they have a guy shrink the floor at the elbow and getting a big in front of my body and a guy guarding to pursue the ball as wellÂ  They are putting me in a position where they can crowd me a lotÂ  If I can get the ball in transition where I'm facing my defender or maybe just one other defender, I can break their defense down. But I will watch film todayÂ  I'm going to break down the filmÂ  We already watched a lot of filmÂ  I'm going to break it down some more, and do a better job of attacking their defense tomorrowÂ  Thanks.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you had that great block on Tiago SplitterÂ  Can you talk about the play and how you think it affected the game.",
        "1": "LeBron, you spoke after Game 1 about distributing confidence to your teammates, the balanceÂ  You have a game today where you got five guys in double figuresÂ  A couple of guys with nine pointsÂ  Does this maybe show a little bit more of why when people say, why weren't you more assertive, and you said, \"because of what we have\"?Ã‚Â  And how comforting was it, while you were struggling to a degree, to have that kind of support system?",
        "2": "You talked about how in that moment you were thinking about, it's going to be a Top Ten play either wayÂ  Is the game really that slow for you where in the time Tony makes a pocket pass and Tiago takes one dribble, you can slow the game down that much where you know that one way or another something really good or really bad is going to happen?",
        "3": "LeBron, you've talked about how Mario has been aggressive on the pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls especially and gone to the basket in a couple of instances today, ending up with andâ€‘one situationsÂ  And then he said he had a conversation with you where he said basically let's go for the kill hereÂ  Can you recount that conversation?",
        "4": "LeBron, after all the focus on your Game 1, what you did do or didn't do, what your boxscore looked like, your numbers aren't that radically different from Game 1Â  You lose Game 1 by four and win this by 19Â  What conclusion should we draw out of that?",
        "5": "Do you come in knowing that if you play the same style of game, guys are making shots and the ball is getting distributed, that it's going to go your way more often than not?",
        "6": "On a night like this when you're not as efficient as you normally are and you're not as in rhythm and not even getting to the freeâ€‘throw line, take us into your mindset as you try to kind of figure out the game and get your own game going, how you did that.",
        "7": "Did you feel you were controlling the game even at that point before you kind of got a little rhythm?",
        "8": "LeBron, one of your shooters, Mike Miller, seemed to be kind of everywhere defensively, had that little flip pass also over to youÂ  How much sort of a refreshing boost has he been?Ã‚Â  Because he seems to have a whole lot of energy.",
        "9": "You talked about the rosters of both teams and how they're built to complement the Big ThreesÂ  How much is that supporting cast for both sides going to impact this series moving forward?",
        "10": "LeBron, what is your take on the 2â€‘3â€‘2 format?Ã‚Â  And do you look at it as no big deal now playing three straight in San Antonio?Ã‚Â  Because you guys historically have been so good on the road.",
        "11": "I know how much you love discussing injuries, but you had a wrap on your knee tonight that was noticeableÂ  Is that a new thing?",
        "12": "It's a condition, not an injury?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Just wanted to, I guess, make an impact some wayÂ  Offensively it was a struggle for me; couldn't make a shot, missed layâ€‘upsÂ  Some things I'm accustomed to makingÂ  So I just wanted to make some plays and try to help our teamÂ  And I was able to protect the rim on that one. Basically I told myself, you'll end up on Sports Center where you're going to get dunked on or you're going to get a blockÂ  Luckily I was on the good side of the Top Ten and the Not So Top Ten.",
        "1": "I already know what we have hereÂ  Like I said, I don't really read into it of what people want more of me or whatever the case may beÂ  I will continue to find my shooters, if they're openÂ  And I will continue to try to put pressure on the defenseÂ  If I draw two, I'll find my shootersÂ  I have confidence they're going to knock them downÂ  They did that tonightÂ  Ray, Mike Miller, Rio made big plays after big plays for us.",
        "2": "YeahÂ  AbsolutelyÂ  I was, I guess, the last line of defenseÂ  I just pride myself on that side of the floor, honestlyÂ  It didn't matter to meÂ  I was going to try to protect the rim the best way I could. Like I said, I was fortunate enough that I was able to make a big play for usÂ  We were able to go down the other end and I think Ray hit a three after that, I believe. Just being on both sides of the floor, being able to make an impact is what it's all about.",
        "3": "Rio, he has to play big for us in multiple facetsÂ  I think that especially defensively he's guarding arguably the best point guard in the leagueÂ  But I think he also has to make Tony work on the defensive endÂ  He can't be passiveÂ  He has to attack the paintÂ  He has to shoot his shots when he has them. We started to get a little flow, and I started to see him start to play really well, especially coming off pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  We ran a lot of pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls between the two of us, and I told him to keep attacking and let's try to push this lead up and go for the killÂ  And we were able to do that.",
        "4": "I don't knowÂ  Whatever conclusion you wantÂ  It's a 1â€‘1 seriesÂ  That's the only conclusion I knowÂ  We look forward to Game 3.",
        "5": "What I do know is sharing the ball is contagious, and it allows everyone to feel involved in the offenseÂ  For me personally, I know I attract a lot of attentionÂ  This team has been set up the right way where when I do attract attention, we have guys that can make plays. Tonight was another case of thatÂ  They packed the paint on meÂ  I seen two bodies, unless I was in transition when I missed a couple of bunniesÂ  But when I felt likeâ€‘â€‘ my shooters just need a little bit of roomÂ  Mike showed that, Ray showed that and Rio showed that tonight.",
        "6": "Now offensively if I'm not in the rhythm, you need to make a couple of plays to make an impactÂ  That's what you're on the floor forÂ  You need to do it on both sides of the floor, however you can do itÂ  I think what helped me was the late third quarter pocket pass from Rio, I was able to get a layâ€‘upÂ  Then I came out in the fourth, I was able to make an elbow jumperÂ  And then I made some plays defensively to try to helpÂ  I made some defensive reboundsÂ  I was able to get the block on Tiago, and then my shooters finished some shots I was able to get them in transition. You know, that's just part of my gameÂ  When I'm not scoring or I'm not as efficient offensively where I feel like I'm missing some shots, I just figure out ways that I can still help the team, even if it's not scoring as much.",
        "7": "Well, honestly for me, when I was struggling offensively, my teammates continue to keep it in rangeÂ  And we even had a lead at one pointÂ  Especially late in the second quarter when we made that run and I was struggling a little bit. So I think Rio more than anybody kept us aggressive, him getting into the paint, him getting those andâ€‘ones and making a couple of threesÂ  It allowed me to sit back and wait for my time.",
        "8": "We want him on the floorÂ  As teammates, we want him on the floorÂ  We know what he bringsÂ  He's a 6'7\", 6'8\" two guard/small forward that can shoot the ball from anywhere and can rebound at a high clipÂ  With the lineup we had in the late third to the fourth, me, Rio, Ray, Bird and Mike it spreads the floorÂ  It spreads the floor for our attackers. When Mike gets the ballâ€‘â€‘ our shooters got the fluorescent light on our teamÂ  They're not even allowed to passÂ  When Ray and Mike get the ball, they have to shoot itÂ  No matter how close the defenders are, they have to shoot itÂ  When you have that leeway and that confidence, you just have to let it go.",
        "9": "I mean, it's keyÂ  The Big Three I guess on both sidesÂ  You know, you can kind of rely on them at all timesÂ  But I think the supporting cast is really why both teams are hereÂ  They've been making an impact all year long, and they feel like their supporting cast is betterÂ  We feel like our supporting cast is betterÂ  It's who goes out and do it each and every night to help seal wins.",
        "10": "I really don'tâ€‘â€‘ it doesn't matterÂ  Two best teams in the NBA at this pointÂ  Both teams have won and can win on each other's floorÂ  So it's not a biggie.",
        "11": "NoÂ  I got a floor burn in Game 1Â  Instead of the bandâ€‘aid, I wrapped it so the bandâ€‘aid won't fall off.",
        "12": "I am okayÂ  Don't worry about me (laughing). FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, based on the 2â€‘3â€‘2 format in the Game 1 loss, how important is a victory in Game 2?",
        "1": "So no extra sense of urgency?",
        "2": "Fourth quarters in the playoffs probably take more out of you than regularâ€‘season games, of courseÂ  How can you find another gear, not just you, but the collective you in the fourth quarter of some of these playoff games?",
        "3": "LeBron, how much of that is just maybe getting Dwyaneâ€‘â€‘ he was talking about how he didn't wear down because of the kneeÂ  He just said he was less aggressive in the second half than he was in the firstÂ  How much of that is just giving him maybe one or two easy ones and sort of seeing everything open up for everyone?",
        "4": "LeBron, is there a different style of basketball when you play a Western Conference team that may take a game or two to get used to or is that overrated?",
        "5": "LeBron, what do you expect from your teammates in Game 2?",
        "6": "I guess before Game 1 you said this is 2013 and you can't make me do what I don't want to doÂ  And then yesterday you talked about Game 1Â  You kind of suggested they made you pass moreÂ  You said you like your passes, but you suggested you could be more aggressiveÂ  Did they make youdo something maybe you didn't want to do?",
        "7": "No one has played more minutes than you the last three postseasons, plus OlympicsÂ  What kind of toll has that taken on you?",
        "8": "LeBron, of all the teams that you've faced with this Miami team in the postseason, how does this San Antonio team compare to all the other tests you've had?",
        "9": "Secondly, a lot of people when they watch you in a game where your team falls short, maybe you don't score at the end.",
        "10": "Should have done moreÂ  Tripleâ€‘double not quite enough for you.",
        "11": "When you hear that, do you think, I need to be more aggressive or do you know you need to be more aggressive?",
        "12": "LeBron, how does the Danny Green that you saw in Cleveland compare to the Danny Green you saw in Game 1?",
        "13": "YesÂ  How have you seen his game grow?",
        "14": "You were saying earlier about trying to get Dwyane some easier opportunities and get him into the flowÂ  Your teammates were talking about how it's not so much about Dwyane's health game to game but just his energy levelÂ  In addition to getting him easy opportunities, are there conversations you have with him to make sure that he's continuing to fight through it the way he needs to fight through it?",
        "15": "LeBron, I wonder about the 24, 48 hours after a playoff loss and how the team responds to that, how the coaches respond to that, specifically in terms of the adjustments that you make from game to gameÂ  How receptive they are to things that you may suggest and how on point they are with the adjustments that they make from game to game.",
        "16": "Do you recall the most brutal film session after a playoff loss that was just really bad?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, at the end of the day it's a Finals gameÂ  Every game is importantÂ  Game 1, Game 2, 3, 4, no matter 2â€‘3â€‘2 format or it could be a 3â€‘2â€‘2 formatÂ  No matter what the format is, it's The Finals; every game is importantÂ  It's the playoffs, actuallyÂ  Every game is important, no matter if you're at home or on the road.",
        "1": "Well, I mean, I think the importance of a game, the urgency should already be thereÂ  That's what playoff basketball is all aboutÂ  You can't afford to, you know, not play with a sense of urgency in a playoff game.",
        "2": "We have to dig downÂ  It's about willÂ  We're a team that expends a lot of energy on both sides of the floorÂ  But we have to figure out a way to have some in the fourth quarter for sure, when it's closing time.",
        "3": "I think it's more important for him than anyone on our teamÂ  Then CB and probably me would be last as far as getting him an easy one, seeing the ball going in and pick up his aggressivenessÂ  When you're a scorer, the best thing for you to do is to get an easy one, a dunk or a layâ€‘up, and it makes the game much easier for you.",
        "4": "No, I think each team is differentÂ  You have to game plan each team differentlyÂ  It's going to take a game, maybe two, to get rhythm of thingsÂ  The Milwaukee series was different from the Chicago seriesÂ  The Chicago series was different from the Indiana seriesÂ  And now this Spurs team is going to be different from all three of those teams. It's just the personnel, how it works, how the coaches prepare those teamsÂ  It's a little bit of everythingÂ  And then each round gets harder and harder, too. So it takes a couple of games, more preparation in the films and in the books, to get to a point where you are comfortable with everything that's going on out on the floor, both offensively and defensively, and the ways you can exploit those challenges.",
        "5": "I expect them to suit up and be on the floor and ready for a gameÂ  That's what I expect out of them.",
        "6": "I was waiting for one of you guys this year, the literal journalists. No, when I decide to pass, I feel like as a teammate hoping I can make a playÂ  Offensively I attract so much attention that if a guy is open on my team, I will pass the ballÂ  And the Spurs did a good job of shrinking the floor and not making me pass the ball, but I've seen guys that were open. So if that's their game plan, we're going to continue to exploit thatÂ  And I believe our guys will be there to knock those shots downÂ  But it's also a few plays I could have been more aggressive as wellÂ  But Game 1, I think I improve as the series goes on as well, seeing ways I can be more aggressive from possession to procession on in the series.",
        "7": "I mean, I would love to have rest, but not at this time of the yearÂ  I wouldn't substitute sitting down in my house right now watching The Finals. It is what it isÂ  It's a tollÂ  It's a toll for myself to go through what I've been through the last twoâ€‘andâ€‘aâ€‘half yearsÂ  But I've been blessed, I've been blessed to be able to be in three FinalsÂ  I've been blessed to be a part of a great Olympic team and to play basketball, the game that I loveÂ  I'm not going to be able to do it foreverÂ  The opportunities that the game has given me the last couple of years, I wouldn't substitute that for rest.",
        "8": "It's a tough testÂ  It's going to be a tough test for usÂ  But I think we've had some tough tests in our three yearsÂ  I thought Dallas wasâ€‘â€‘ Dallas beat us and they were very toughÂ  They were very smartÂ  They were a veteran ballclubÂ  They had some great playersÂ  I thought some of the Chicago series that we've had, even though we've won 4â€‘1 against them in both our playoff series, those were some testsÂ  We've had some challenges. Oklahoma City gave us a scare a little bit in Game 1 of last year's FinalsÂ  But we were able to figure that outÂ  We've had some pretty good battles, and I thinkâ€‘â€‘ let me not forget this, being down 3â€‘2 going into Boston last yearÂ  I think that was a huge test for us, tooÂ  For them to come here and they beat us in Game 5, and we had to go out and beat two in a row just to advanceÂ  So we've had some pretty good tests and we've been able to overcome.",
        "9": "I should have done more, right?",
        "10": "Right.",
        "11": "No, I can't get involved in that honestly, because I've done more and lost beforeÂ  I mean, we played Orlandoâ€‘â€‘ when I was in Cleveland we played Orlando in the Eastern Conference Finals and I think I averaged 38â€‘â€‘ 36, or whatever I averagedÂ  I guess I should have done more in that series as wellÂ  But I can't. I can't really get involved or careâ€‘â€‘ I don't really read too muchÂ  I know what I say to you guys and I know the questions you guys ask me, but I don't really read too much of what people sayÂ  I do what's best for the teamÂ  What's best for the team, it doesn't always result in a win. I wish we could go 16â€‘0 in the playoffsÂ  That would be awesomeÂ  There's challenges that come from the gameÂ  You learn from game to game in ways that you can get betterÂ  I want to win just as bad as anyoneÂ  I'm going to put myself and my team in a position to winÂ  I have to try to make the playsÂ  I can't worry about if people are saying, you should have done more, you should have been more aggressive, because you got a lossÂ  Winning and losing is part of the game.",
        "12": "Is that a serious question?",
        "13": "I think, first of all, opportunityÂ  That's what it's about in this leagueÂ  It's about a coach believing in you, giving you the opportunityÂ  And it's about your teammates believing in you and giving you the confidence, and then about yourself just going out and doing itÂ  I think it's the same thing with Paul George and the same thing with Danny Green on different levels because Paul George gets more of a burden offensively from his teamÂ  But Frank Vogel gave Paul George the keys this year, and allowed him to grow and his teammates gave him confidence and he started believing in himselfÂ  And I think that's what Pop about with Danny. In practice Danny would play well for us, but he was behind some veteran guys, myself and Sasha Pavlovic and Delonte West and Mo Williams and Boobie GibsonÂ  It was very tough for him to get on the floorÂ  Also being a rookie tooÂ  But I've seen the talent he hadÂ  He showed the talent when he was in North CarolinaÂ  Once he got to Pop, Pop gave him confidenceÂ  You get the opportunity, you go out and make the most of it.",
        "14": "What I tell Dâ€‘Wade is when he's most in tune with the game, I can see it on his faceÂ  I think his face just shows where he's at in the gameÂ  I don't know if it's maybe his knee or maybe frustrated at times or maybe he's just not in the rhythmÂ  But I can see it on his face when he's thereÂ  That's what I told him, even if sometimes you're not in the rhythm, I need to see your face that you're in tune and you're ready for the next possession and ready to move on from whatever is going on. For me as one of the leaders of the team who has the ball in his hands a lot, I have to do my part as well to help them, I guess, get that face, where he feels like he's involved, and where he feels like he's a part of everything that's going on, both offensively and defensivelyÂ  And it helps us outÂ  When his energy level is high, his motor is going and his face isâ€‘â€‘ he feels like, he looks like he's in tune, we're a really, really powerful team.",
        "15": "Well, there's pros and cons with having 48 hours in between games, especially after a lossÂ  You think about it a lot and it eats away at youÂ  But at the same time it allows you to really pinpoint ways you can get better in the next gameÂ  We had yesterday, we had today, and we will also use tomorrow, shootaround to continue to, I guess, get more familiar with what the game plan will be tomorrow. So the time definitely helpsÂ  And the communication, like you said, the communication between the players and the coaches has to be receptive and open and honest in order for the game plan to work, because we have to have everyone on page from the coaching staff to the players once we get on the floor because the game is kind of so fast. I think it's been great for us, these last I don't know how many hours it's been since Game 1Â  But we've used the time, I think, wisely in this case.",
        "16": "We've had a coupleÂ  We've had a couple where, you know, the players didn't like the coachesÂ  Coaches didn't like the playersÂ  And I think that's very healthyÂ  It happensÂ  The coaches want the players to do everything right, and sometimes the players want to do it or believe that they're doing everything right. So we've had film sessions where we both left out of it, I guess, not liking each other, but agreeing on what happened and owning it and seeing the ways we can get it better in the next gameÂ  And it usually happens during the playoffs. I think everything is just magnifiedÂ  It's more emotions, more everything in the playoffsÂ  For a veteran ballclub, we shouldn't sugarcoat anything when it comes to wanting to get better and improving.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you guys are 4â€‘4 in your last eight, which is kind of unusual with the runs you guys have been on through the seasonÂ  Obviously a terrific series against the PacersÂ  Do you guys feel you've dropped off from some of the great runs you have had?Ã‚Â  And is there any reason that there was unbelievable efficiency at some times during the season and now not as much?Ã‚Â  Or is it just the opponents?",
        "1": "LeBron, Kawhi Leonard thinks you could come out more assertive in Game 2Â  Do you think there's going to be times in this series where you're going to have to, maybe as you phrased it a week or two, go back to your Cleveland days?",
        "2": "To follow up, can you just talk about your general fatigue level now?Ã‚Â  And how much does it take out of a player when you've got to work on the boards so hard as you did, 18 rebounds the other night?",
        "3": "LeBron, you've gone through it three times, four times now, losing Game 1sÂ  The first three times you won in five every timeÂ  When so much spotlight is on you guys, so much pressure on you guys this time of year, why do you make it look so easy to overcome these 0â€‘1 deficits?",
        "4": "LeBron, Tony Parker played 39 1/2 minutes last night without a turnoverÂ  Erik just called him cleverÂ  What makes him so smart?",
        "5": "LeBron, their strategy to kind of load up the paint on you and force you to maybe make a pass when you get inâ€‘â€‘ I know you've seen that before, but as you watch or review it, are there things you can do to counter that?",
        "6": "LeBron, Erik was talking about whatever it takesÂ  Obviously that's where we're at in this point of the seasonÂ  What kind of appreciation do you have though for what Dâ€‘Wade is going through trying to get ready, getting the uncertainty that he has to deal with?",
        "7": "LeBron, you've taken on the challenge of guarding Rondo in past playoffsÂ  You took on Tony late in the game last nightÂ  How much of the game is it realistic for you to go head to head with him and guard him?Ã‚Â  And what are the pluses and minuses of asking you to take on that challenge for more than just a few possessions at a time?",
        "8": "LeBron, maybe besides the missed shots, what was your review of your fourth quarter offensive execution last night?Ã‚Â  And maybe what are some of the things that needs to be done?",
        "9": "LeBron, Erik came in and talked about how one of the most important priorities going forward is to get Chris more touches in the paintÂ  What do you think about that?Ã‚Â  And how difficult will that be?Ã‚Â  And do you need him to go down there more often?",
        "10": "Did their defense dictate that you play distributor last night or was that a conscious decision?Ã‚Â  And will you make that type of decision in Game 2?",
        "11": "LeBron, Coach said he used the word \"painful\" when watching the film for the fourth quarterÂ  What word would you use to describe watching the film of the fourth quarter?Ã‚Â  And you said that you can get better in the fourthÂ  What are those areas where you can?",
        "12": "LeBron, one last tough memory:Ã‚Â  That Parker shot, has that run through your mind since?Ã‚Â  And is there anything you would have done differently?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, I think as the rounds go on and on, the opponents and the teams that you're facing become better, and we know thatÂ  We've been able to get better as wellÂ  We're in the NBA Finals, we can't worry about we're 4â€‘4 in the last eight gamesÂ  We're in the NBA Finals and we have to try to make the most of it.",
        "1": "I play every gameâ€‘â€‘ I don't really predetermine what I'm going to doÂ  I kind of let the game flow for itselfÂ  We'll see what happens.",
        "2": "It is toughÂ  But it is what it isÂ  I put myself in a position to try to do everything for this team, a little bit of everything, and put myself in a position to winÂ  It's very challenging mentally, physicallyÂ  But you have to figure out a way to just have will at this point of the seasonÂ  There's not too many days leftÂ  There's no room for excuses.",
        "3": "It's not easy for sureÂ  It's definitely not going to be easy versus this team we're going against nowÂ  But we've been able to get betterÂ  We've been able to make adjustments going from one game to the nextÂ  We kind of just bounce back after a lossÂ  No matter if it's on the road or at homeÂ  We've been able to bounce back.",
        "4": "He's been in this position multiple timesÂ  He's a very, very smart playerÂ  Highâ€‘engine playerÂ  I think it's very unique for him not to have any turnovers last night versus our defenseÂ  I think Popâ€‘â€‘ they've been on the same page for so many years, they know the system more than anybody. He does a great job of running their offense and putting himself and putting those guys in position to succeed.",
        "5": "I had some more opportunities where I could have maybe been a little more aggressive or look for my shotÂ  But I don't to take away from any plays I made last nightÂ  I was able to still find my guys for some shotsÂ  We missed some shotsÂ  We had some wideâ€‘open clips where I had two defenders guarding meÂ  Two plays in the third quarter I was able to find Rio for two open threes that he just missed, two great shotsÂ  I found CB for four really good looks that he missed, that he's capable of making. My guys are openÂ  I've got this far with them, I'm not going to just abandon what I've been doing all year to help us get to this pointÂ  So I know those guys will be ready to shoot again once they're open.",
        "6": "It was a tough situationÂ  He spends countless hours of treatment and whatever you can do to try to just prepare for one game each and every nightÂ  I've never been in that position, so I can feel for him, but I can't really understand exactly what he's going throughÂ  You appreciate when someone like that puts their body on the line each and every night when they're not even close to 100%.",
        "7": "I think the game will present whatever the game presents itself, opportunities for me to guard TonyÂ  If it's early in the game, late in the game, it won't be the full gameÂ  I think we have confidence in our two point guardsÂ  There will be times where I match up against him. So defensively he does a lot of running, comes off a lot of pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  So I have to be ready for thatÂ  Offensively it presents a little challenge for me once I get back on the other end, chasing after Tony and going through all the screens that he goes throughÂ  But I'm ready for itÂ  I'm ready for the challengeÂ  It's something I live for.",
        "8": "We just had some very empty possessions where we didn't get to anythingÂ  Got to some random sets and we had a couple of turnovers that we're not really accustomed to havingÂ  We played a very efficient game, but in the fourth quarter we kind of got a little sloppy when we're usually really good. So we watched film todayÂ  We watched an hour of film, an hour and a half of filmÂ  We know where we can get better and be better in Game 2.",
        "9": "It won't be difficultÂ  I think if he accepts the challenge to want to put pressure in the paint, he'll have it. We run our offense through CB mostlyÂ  I get a few sets, but I get a lot of mine off of rebounding, defensive rebounding and Dâ€‘Wade gets a few setsÂ  Mostly our offense goes through Chris, either in the elbow action or we run situations where Dâ€‘Wade will come off a flare and CB's manwill drop and help, and CB gets that action where he catches the ball at the elbow. Wherever CB demands the ball in the post, we'll give it to himÂ  We love when CB comes out because we know he's being aggressiveÂ  We need that paint attack from him.",
        "10": "They shrunk the floor a lot and they put five, four, at times they tripleâ€‘teamed me in the postÂ  Do the mathÂ  If I have three guys on me, four against three or four against two on the back sideÂ  So guys are open, and I believe in my teammates that they're going to make the right play after that. My job is to draw attention from those guysÂ  Once they get the ball, they can be in attack mode or do what they need to do to help our team. Every game presents different challengesÂ  I'm not sure what the game plan they'll have tomorrowÂ  It may changeÂ  I knowSunday, I know we're going to make adjustments as well going into Game 2Â  We'll seeÂ  We'll see what type of game plan I come out with on SundayÂ  It will be dumb of me to reveal it today.",
        "11": "Obviously, we had some empty possessions where we didn't get into any of our setsÂ  We had a few turnovers whichâ€‘â€‘ some of them were just unforcedÂ  We can't have unforced turnovers, especially in The Finals, especially versus a very good Spurs team that's going to come up the other end and execute really well. It was painfulÂ  It's always tough watching a playoff loss and see how many mistakes you madeÂ  But that's what you learn forÂ  That's the good thing about this team, we own it and we watch it and then we try not to make the same mistake the next time.",
        "12": "No, I mean I've seen it today on filmÂ  But it didn't run through my mind too much after the game last nightÂ  It was a tough shotÂ  He came off a pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollÂ  He bobbled it, he backed up, he tripped, he fell and he got up and went under my arm and made a tough bank shotÂ  That's not why we lost the gameÂ  That's a huge shot, but it's not why we lost the game. No, didn't really bother me too much. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, can you take us through Tony's last play and that final possession.",
        "1": "2â€‘3â€‘2 format is always tough when you lose one of those first two at homeÂ  You guys experienced that a couple of years agoÂ  How does that change your mindset as you go forward?",
        "2": "What did the Spurs do to you defensively?Ã‚Â  Did they try to force you to become a distributor?",
        "3": "LeBron, I guess along the same lines, it looked like in the fourth quarter you weren't getting a whole lot of helpÂ  Did it seem that way?",
        "4": "LeBron, you guys obviously made the adjustmentÂ  You ended up on Tony Parker in the crunchtime situationÂ  You always talk about how you guys present a pickâ€‘yourâ€‘poison type situation to other teamsÂ  Is this a team that you guys have to look at it that way?",
        "5": "LeBron, you talked yesterday about how you have a much better team than in 2007 when you faced the SpursÂ  How do the Spurs compare?Ã‚Â  Do they look like the same old Spurs even though their Big Three are six years older or what?",
        "6": "LeBron, I asked Erik about you and Dwyane sitting to start the fourthÂ  He said both of you needed a minuteÂ  Do you go to him or did he go to you?",
        "7": "LeBron, when Dwyane came in, he said that the Heat looked a little bit like a fatigued team that had played a sevenâ€‘game series in the fourth quarterÂ  Was that in part the difference in this game tonight?",
        "8": "LeBron, you guys often talk about how in these three years together you have seen and experienced absolutely everything at this pointÂ  Do you rely on that right now to get through the next couple of days and not let this one loss overshadow what could be coming up?",
        "9": "LeBron, you had 18 points on 16 fieldâ€‘goal attemptsÂ  How do you get that offensive efficiency up?",
        "10": "LeBron, three times before this loss your team went down 1â€‘0 in a series, and in all of those times you wonÂ  In fact, you've won every game in the series after that pointÂ  When you think back to Oklahoma City last year and Chicago this year, do you remember the team changing in intensity and focus in any way?Ã‚Â  Why has that happened in the past and can it happen this year?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It was toughÂ  You're going to make me go back to that play?Ã‚Â  Tony did everything wrong and did everything right in the same possessionÂ  He stumbled two or three times, he fell over, and when he fell over, I was like, okay, I'm going to have to tie this ball upÂ  He got up and went under my armÂ  I got a great contest, and he even doubleâ€‘pumped it and barely got it offÂ  That was the longest 24 seconds that I've been a part of.",
        "1": "It is what it isÂ  It's a sevenâ€‘game seriesÂ  You know, we got to see ways we can get better for Game 2Â  We can only focus on the next gameÂ  That's what it's about.",
        "2": "Well, yeahÂ  They did a good job of putting two guys on the ballÂ  When I got the ball, they kind of shrunk the floor and set a guy at the elbow and dared me to pass the ball. I know my guys will be there to knock those shots down the next gameÂ  We had some really good looks, especially in the third quarterÂ  Rio had some very good looksÂ  It just didn't go down. They did a good job tonight.",
        "3": "We had our chances to winÂ  We go into the fourth quarter with a threeâ€‘point leadÂ  So we had our chancesÂ  We had five turnovers in the fourthÂ  We gave them some offensive rebounds in the fourth as wellÂ  And Tim Duncan had one putback; Kawhi Leonard had another oneÂ  We can't allow that.",
        "4": "Yeah, against this team you can't make many mistakesÂ  You look at statistics, you know, we put in ourselves in position to winÂ  They shot 31%Â  We outrebounded them by 9Â  We had more assistsÂ  But we turned the ball over five times in the fourth. I was looking at the stat sheetÂ  It says they had 21 secondâ€‘chance pointsÂ  I don't really understand how is that possible with only six offensive reboundsÂ  I'm very good at math, and the only way you can get a secondâ€‘chance point is if you get off a reboundÂ  Am I correct?Ã‚Â  Even if you hit a three, six offensive rebounds, that's still 18 pointsÂ  I don't understand how that works. But we had chancesÂ  That's kind of weirdÂ  I don't understand thisÂ  Am I right or am I wrong?Ã‚Â  Am I right?Ã‚Â  OkayÂ  It's crazy.",
        "5": "The Spurs are the SpursÂ  They're going to put you in positions where you feel uncomfortable offensively and defensivelyÂ  And every time you make a mistake, they're going to capitalize on it.",
        "6": "I told him I needed oneÂ  At that point I had played the whole thirdÂ  I had been accustomed to being able to start the fourthÂ  But the third quarter was soâ€‘â€‘ I was in the paint, defensive rebounding, I was closing out Kawhi Leonard on shootersÂ  It took all in the tank from me in the third quarterÂ  So I needed a little breather.",
        "7": "The fourth quarter was the differenceÂ  I can see it on a few of our guys' facesÂ  Felt a little fatigued, still a little banged up from that sevenâ€‘game seriesÂ  They looked like they were rested in the fourth quarterÂ  They took advantage of thatÂ  We had some mental mistakes, and we played some really good basketballÂ  But in the closing quarter we had some mental mistakesÂ  And it's only a couple of teams you can't have mistakes against, especially in the fourthÂ  And San Antonio is definitely the number one team.",
        "8": "It's the first team to fourÂ  They came in and beat us on our own floor in Game 1Â  I know they're going to be hungry to try to get twoÂ  So we have to be able to combat that and come back with a Game 2 plan that's better than Game 1 and even the series.",
        "9": "I mean, I missed some shotsÂ  I missed some really good looksÂ  As far as being efficient, I'm not worried about thatÂ  I also had 18 rebounds and 10 assists as wellÂ  So you know, I'm not too much worried about what I do as far as scoring.",
        "10": "I think one thing about our team we've gotten better as the series went onÂ  We hate to lose before we start to get a little edge, but that's what happensÂ  We'll see if we can continue to repeat what we've been doing in the series, being down, and come back on Sunday with aâ€‘â€‘ like I say, with a better game plan, you know, and try to even the series FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, obviously it took a lot of stress and also gave you a lot of satisfaction to get your first championshipÂ  For your legacy, what would it mean to get multiple?",
        "1": "How about what it would mean to get the second one?",
        "2": "LeBron, how will the 2013 version of LeBron James be different from the 2007 version that the Spurs faced in The Finals?",
        "3": "We watched you on ESPN all day yesterday when Duncan and you kind of met in the hallway thereÂ  It's kind of a cool momentÂ  But when youâ€‘â€‘",
        "4": "What was it like when you go back to that and you see that and even watch film of that series?",
        "5": "Do you have any getâ€‘back in you for 2007 going into the series?",
        "6": "LeBron, can you talk about winning and losing and how losing can fuel you a little more in this kind of situation?",
        "7": "To follow that up, when you look at the San Antonio Spurs, they're pretty oldÂ  I mean, they actually make you guys look kind of youngÂ  Do you feel that?Ã‚Â  You guys are the young team coming inÂ  You guys have been in the league for a long time.",
        "8": "LeBron, every series takes on its own lifeÂ  Obviously the Pacers a more physical teamÂ  The Spurs a little bit differentÂ  Do you see this as a series where maybe Dwyane and Chris can break out of their funk a little moreÂ  Maybe better matchâ€‘ups or more conducive to their styles?",
        "9": "LeBron, so when Tim had those words after that '07 series, was it hard for you to appreciate it at the time because you were still in competitive mode or did you appreciate he had nice words for you?",
        "10": "Is it hard for athletes to say \"this team was better than us\"?Ã‚Â  Because a lot of guys when they lose a Finals say, we did this wrong, this wrongÂ  You right from the start said, \"We couldn't have beaten themÂ  They were better.\"Ã‚Â  Is that difficult to do?",
        "11": "LeBron, Tim Duncan's numbers this season are almost identical to what they were in 2007Â  What do you think it is about Tim Duncan that has allowed him to be so relevant at 37 and to maintain such a high level of his playing?",
        "12": "LeBron, to that end, as a student of NBA history, how do you think Tim will ultimately be regarded in this era as one of the players of this era?Ã‚Â  How do you think he'll be viewed?",
        "13": "Tim.",
        "14": "LeBron, have you ever watched a Spurs game throughout your career and then gone back to your team that you're playing on at the time and say, we need to do that?",
        "15": "What situation do you prefer, to have a rest for nine days and to have a good rest, and to have a rest just for two days but to keep the pace, the winning pace?",
        "16": "LeBron, you talked about how much smarter you are compared to the 2007 FinalsÂ  But on the court, your jumpshot, are you more confident now?Ã‚Â  And the improvement since then, how does that affect how they guard you this time around?",
        "17": "LeBron, this year the challenge is going to be on Kawhi Leonard to try to defend youÂ  Can you talk about him as a player offensively and defensively, what he brings to that team and your matchâ€‘up."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't play this game for my legacyÂ  I play the game because I love it and I have fun playing it, and I love the competitive side of itÂ  Once I'm done, I don'tâ€‘â€‘ you guys will write my legacy and say what I've done for this gameÂ  But that's not for me to worry about right now.",
        "1": "That's what I play the game for, is to win championshipsÂ  I understand that it's a long process, it's the most difficult thing I've ever had to do playing basketball. That's what I'm here forÂ  I'm here to win championships, and you're not always going to be on the successful sideÂ  I've seen it twice, not being on the successful sideÂ  To be able to just put myself in the position to be able to play for one, I'm happy with that.",
        "2": "Just smarterÂ  A lot smarterÂ  More experiencedÂ  OlderÂ  More mature both on and off the floorÂ  And I think that's the most important thingÂ  I've matured as a basketball playerÂ  I've matured as a manÂ  And it has allowed my game to sprout.",
        "3": "It's cool for you guysÂ  It wasn't cool for me.",
        "4": "It's been a while since I've seen the seriesÂ  I'm pretty good with going back on my mental about what happenedÂ  It was toughÂ  We ran against a team that was more superior, more experienced, more betterâ€‘â€‘ that's not even a wordâ€‘â€‘ better than we were at the timeÂ  And they took advantage of every miscue, inexperience thing that we did on the floor. That allowed them to raise the Larry O'Brien Trophy.",
        "5": "I mean, it's a great opportunityÂ  I have something in me that they took in '07; beat us on our home floor, celebrated on our home floorÂ  I won't forget thatÂ  You shouldn't as a competitorÂ  You should never forget that. It's the same group of guys, for the most partÂ  The same Big Three, and Coach PopÂ  And I look forward to the challenge once again.",
        "6": "Well, I've lost enoughÂ  I don't need any more fuel from losingÂ  I've lost two FinalsÂ  So I don't need any more fuel from losing The Finals.",
        "7": "No, there's not any young teams in thisÂ  It's the two best, experienced, wellâ€‘coached teams in The FinalsÂ  They're in The Finals for a reason:Ã‚Â  For their experience, how well they're coached, how balanced they are, and their championship DNAÂ  There's no advantages.",
        "8": "That's what we hopeÂ  We don't know until the series gets startedÂ  Every team we play causes different problemsÂ  From Milwaukee to Chicago to Indiana and now San AntonioÂ  So we don't actually know until the series begin. What we do know is how we're going to playÂ  We're going to play our gameÂ  We're going to share the ball. Ã‚Â We're going to attack, try to get to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  And with that attack, myself, Dâ€‘Wade, CB are the key ingredients to that attack. They don't need to put no pressure on themselvesÂ  These guys have been to The FinalsÂ  Dâ€‘Wade has two ringsÂ  CB has oneÂ  We've been in this position beforeÂ  They know how to play.",
        "9": "I mean, it's however you take it, honestlyÂ  He had just won and I just lostÂ  I don't knowÂ  I didn't remember too much about it until I seen the footage once againÂ  I appreciate having an opportunity to go against a great team and just use that as motivation to get me better.",
        "10": "No, it's obviousÂ  The team beat you 4â€‘0, are you going to say, \"They weren't better than us?\"Ã‚Â  It was obviousÂ  They were a better teamÂ  They were more experiencedÂ  Like I said, they took advantage of all the miscues we had.",
        "11": "First, I think it's him staying in shape, his conditioning levelÂ  I think it's the great support that they have in San AntonioÂ  Also I think it's him being a true professional to the gameÂ  Giving everything to the gameÂ  And when you give everything to the game, the game rewards youÂ  And I think it's all of that. He's a championÂ  He has championship DNAÂ  And like I said, when you give everything to the game, as far as, you know, sacrifices that you make, the game repays youÂ  It has allowed him to continue to play at a high level, even at his age.",
        "12": "Who?",
        "13": "Probably one of the best players to ever play the game of basketballÂ  If I just look at the last 15 years, he's probably been the most consistent, most dominant player that we've had as far as 15 years all togetherÂ  He's won four titles, multiple All Stars, MVP, and so on and so on. I think He doesn't get a lot of recognition because he's not flashy like a lot of guys areÂ  He's not jumping over people and highâ€‘flying and doing the things that attracts people to the gameÂ  But I think true basketball, true IQ people, players know how great he isÂ  What else can you say?",
        "14": "I mean, yeahÂ  AbsolutelyÂ  I just think the one thing that you kind of always seen, no matter what, they've always shared the ball and played as a teamÂ  That's winning basketballÂ  That's something I've always kind of been taught throughout my whole life, especially when I was a kid, moving the ball, and everybody feeling importantÂ  If you move the defense from side to side, something is going to open up for youÂ  You always see the Spurs doing that.",
        "15": "I'm ready to play nowÂ  I would rather have the two days.",
        "16": "I think in '07 they keptâ€‘â€‘ when I got the ball, they kept me on the sidelineÂ  They went under a lot of my pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls and dared me to shootÂ  Back in '07 I ran a lot of pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  They funneled me to the sideline with Duncan and Oberto and Bruce Bowen and Michael Finley and those guys funneled me to the sideline and dared me to shoot it, and didn't allow me to get to the paint where I did most of my damage back in '07. If you go into my pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll now, I'm going to shootÂ  And I'm confident I'm going to make every last one of themÂ  I'm just more confident in my ability to shoot the ballÂ  But at the same time, I also have a lot more weapons this time around going against this team, where in '07 they loaded three guys to me a lot on the strong side of the floor. So like I said, I'm a better player, AND you can't dare me to do anything I don't want to do in 2013.",
        "17": "I think he brings athleticism to their front courtÂ  He brings a guy who can guard multiple positions with his length, with his wingspan and his ability to get out in transition and finishÂ  And also shoot threes in the corner, brings a dynamic to their team that they didn't have before they got him, and Danny Green. I had Danny in Cleveland with me as my rook, so this is going to be great to go against himÂ  I'm happy for what he's been able to doÂ  I'm looking forward to the challengeÂ  I mean, I've playedâ€‘â€‘ I have had every pretty much good defender that has to offer in these playoffs, from Mbah a Moute to Jimmy Butler to Paul George and now Kawhi Leonard. So it doesn't change for meÂ  I'm looking forward to the challengeÂ  I also play both sides of the floor as wellÂ  I'm not just an offensive playerÂ  I play defense as well. Not only will I attack my defender on offense, I will attack my offensive player defensively. THE MODERATOR:Ã‚Â  Thanks, LeBron. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, there were some questions during the series about the support system here, Chris struggling, Dwyane struggling, Ray couldn't hit a shotÂ  What does it feel like to get Dwyane back to being Dwyane, Chris hitting the boards, Ray making three threeâ€‘pointers?Ã‚Â  How much easier does it make it on you?Ã‚Â  How much better does it make the team?",
        "1": "LeBron, I know you read a game, early in this game it did seem like you were kind of allowing your teammates to get into it a little bit until you started to see some openingsÂ  Go through your strategy a little bit about what you were trying to do there.",
        "2": "LeBron earlier Spo said no one remembers the easy wins, the sweepsÂ  People remember the Game 7sÂ  What's your mindset attacking a Game 7?Ã‚Â  And how important is it for big players to step up in big moments?",
        "3": "Highâ€‘caliber athlete, is this always a proveâ€‘it factor?Ã‚Â  You have to prove it?Ã‚Â  You have to do it in these situations?",
        "4": "LeBron, how soon did you start thinking about the Spurs?Ã‚Â  And considering that was the team you faced the first time in The Finals, how much of an incentive is it to show your growth since then?",
        "5": "LeBron, five points separated you guys through six games going into tonightÂ  When you checked out with five minutes left and it was 25 or 28 or whatever it was, just how stunning was that this one wasn't down to the wire, like you guys probably deep down might have thought it could have been?",
        "6": "LeBron, it's a different team for you going back into The Finals against the SpursÂ  We talked a couple of days ago about what they were when you saw them the first timeÂ  It's still those same big threeÂ  How much better do you feel going back in armed with what you've got now?",
        "7": "LeBron, Dwyane kind of unveiled the Euro step in the first quarter and shook Lance StephensonÂ  He just kept on comingÂ  What did you see from him?Ã‚Â  And the fact that you kind of took the burden with Paul George, how much do you think that meant to him?",
        "8": "LeBron, a year ago when you beat the Celtics in the Conference Finals, you entered the Finals 0â€‘2, having lost two FinalsÂ  Now you enter with a championship under your beltÂ  Does your frame of mind change compared to a year ago entering The Finals?",
        "9": "LeBron, what's more relieving, defeating the Pacers, a very difficult Pacers team, or reaching The Finals?",
        "10": "YeahÂ  What's more a relief?Ã‚Â  Getting past a very difficult Indiana team or achieving the goal of getting to The Finals again?",
        "11": "LeBron, you had 15 free throws, and the Pacers had 14Â  Was that just a product of being the veteran team in a Game 7 and wanting to establish that aggressiveness early?",
        "12": "You talked about having a perspective where you remind yourself that basketball is just a gameÂ  What helped you sort of get to that thinking or made you have to take that thinking?Ã‚Â  And also how has that helped you as a leader on this team?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, obviously we're a much better team when we have everyone clicking at the same timeÂ  That's obviousÂ  And we've had more games where everyone was clicking than not soÂ  It just happened that this series guys were just not in the rhythm, not feeling like themselves. Hey, you save it to the last game, and it allows us to advance, then I'm okay with that.",
        "1": "AbsolutelyÂ  The first play of the game I called a play for Dâ€‘WadeÂ  Even though he didn't shoot the ball, he got a good touch in the paintÂ  Just to make him feel like he was a part of the offense, make him feel in a good rhythmÂ  I called a couple of sets for him early in the game, just to get a feel for itÂ  And it showed throughout the whole game that he was in the rhythmÂ  He started to make layâ€‘ups, he started to attack, he started to make his free throwsÂ  So it was big time.",
        "2": "This is what it's all aboutÂ  I dreamed about opportunities like this as a kid to have a Game 7, no matter at home or on the roadÂ  And that game allows you to advance to The FinalsÂ  I have had multiple dreams about itÂ  To see a dream become a reality, I'm just very blessedÂ  Our team is blessedÂ  And we're just happy that we are able to represent the Eastern Conference in The Finals.",
        "3": "I guess that's what it isÂ  That's the notion that highâ€‘caliber players need to step up and play at the highest level in Game 7sÂ  I've been blessed to doâ€‘â€‘ to be pretty good in Game 7s in my career.",
        "4": "Well, I'm not going to take this win for grantedÂ  I'm definitely going to savor this win tonightÂ  This league is so hard to win inÂ  It's so hard to advance, that you can't take these moments for granted. So tonight I'm definitely going to savor this for my friends and my familyÂ  And deciding what we do as a team tomorrow, I'll start to get back into the books and get back into the film on a team that's very good, very disciplined, well coachedÂ  They've got a bunch of Hallâ€‘ofâ€‘Famers. So I look forward to the challenge, but I'm not quite there yet mentally, because I'm not going to take it for granted what we were able to accomplish tonight.",
        "5": "We came in with the mindset just stay at the task at handÂ  We can't worry about the rewardÂ  We can't worry about trying to advanceÂ  We just have to worry about every possessionÂ  For the first time I believe in this seriesâ€‘â€‘ probably in Game 3 as wellâ€‘â€‘ we just focused on every possessionÂ  Try to get stopsÂ  Try not to turn the ball overÂ  Get shotsÂ  And play Miami Heat defenseÂ  Create havocÂ  And I thought we did a great job of that tonight.",
        "6": "First of all, I think our team is more experienced, first of allÂ  My Cleveland team, we were very young, and we went up against a very experienced team, wellâ€‘coached teamÂ  And they took advantage of everything that we did. I think for this team, this is our third year advancing to The FinalsÂ  So we're very experienced as wellÂ  We're not young, we're not inexperiencedÂ  We understand the opportunity that we have. And I'm a much better playerÂ  I'm 20, 40, 50 times better than I was in the '07 Finals, very young, and you knowÂ  So, yeah, we're all better.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, any little pressure I could take off Dâ€‘Wade I wanted to do that, especially in tonight's gameÂ  I told him we kind of talked about it this morning, about the matchâ€‘ups coming outÂ  I told him I would take Paul GeorgeÂ  I want to allow him to focus on his offense, not have to worry about stopping Paul George every possession and allow him to get out in transition, allow him to get out in transition, allow him to make a couple of cuts and get to the line. I think that was huge for him.",
        "8": "NoÂ  Ever since I lost The Finals to Dallas, my mind frame changed that offâ€‘seasonÂ  I just wanted to get back to playing the game that I love and have fun and play it at a high level and justâ€‘â€‘ I'll take this opportunity and this unbelievable game that we have for granted. So my mindset has been the same since we lost to DallasÂ  I'm looking forward to it.",
        "9": "What's more relieving?",
        "10": "I mean, I don't knowÂ  As a team this is what we had as a goal, that's to get back to The FinalsÂ  But we didn't cut any corners throughout the process, throughout the whole seasonÂ  This is an opportunity for us again to be able to win another championship. So I don't have a relief at all of anything right now because I have a lot of work to still doÂ  But it's a great thing to be in this position.",
        "11": "Yes, we were just aggressiveÂ  We were very aggressiveÂ  I was very aggressiveÂ  That's how you control tempoÂ  You control tempo by getting to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  One thing it allows us to do, it allows us to set our halfâ€‘court defenseÂ  When we get to the freeâ€‘throw line, we shot 86% from the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  We got there 38 times. We know that we're very good in the half courtÂ  And the games that Indiana won, they put a lot of pressure on us in transitionÂ  And tonight we only gave them five points in transitionÂ  We only gave them 12 secondâ€‘chance points and only 28 points in the paintÂ  It was a byâ€‘product of us getting to the freeâ€‘throw line and allowing us to get our defense set.",
        "12": "I think the zone and the comfort level I'm in right now happened because Dallas beat usÂ  Dallas beat us in The Finals two years agoâ€‘â€‘ or three years ago, whenever it wasÂ  I just went back to the basicsÂ  I went back home, I went back to OhioÂ  I worked out with my high school coachÂ  I went back to my high school gym, and just put myself in the mindset of what made me fall in love with the gameÂ  And it's because I had a lot of fun with it. Every night I stepped on the basketball court, I wanted to have funÂ  I wanted to represent myself and my family and friends at the highest level. But at the end of the day, it is just a basketball gameÂ  There are so many things in life that happens that you can just put the gameâ€‘â€‘ you can put life in perspectiveÂ  Like I said the other day with the little girl that passed away, \"live like Bella,\" that we had on our shoesÂ  A little girl that passed away here in South FloridaÂ  Once again that just put the game of basketball, it's just a game; it put life in perspective. I'm happy I'm able to play this game at the highest levelÂ  I love to competeÂ  I love to represent what basketball stands forÂ  But I don't put too much added pressure on myself, because I know it's just a game.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, can you just explain tonight?",
        "1": "LeBron, you're just not getting much help from Dwyane and ChrisÂ  Do you feel like you have to do it all in Game 7?",
        "2": "LeBron, to piggyback on his question, Bosh and Wade were 4â€‘ofâ€‘19 all nightÂ  How much of that was because of the Pacers' defense or they just had a bad night?",
        "3": "LeBron, can you just take us through the play as far as the offensive foul and running down the court, the technical.",
        "4": "Was it your understanding the tech was for the way you ran down the court?Ã‚Â  Or did you say something as you went down there?",
        "5": "LeBron, Dwyane said after the game that he felt he just didn't have enough opportunitiesÂ  What's your take on that?",
        "6": "As far as Chris, we know he hurt his ankle the other nightÂ  He says it's been just not happening for him the entire series, and he's not sure whyÂ  Any thoughts on Chris?",
        "7": "LeBron to that end, you were in this situation just a year ago actually against BostonÂ  What can you draw from that?Ã‚Â  And with all the expectations that are on the line this season, how do you keep guys relaxed over the next couple of days to just not put all the expectations in front of them?",
        "8": "Throughout this series the story has been the same when it comes to points in the paint and reboundingÂ  In the games you guys have lost, you guys have pretty much got destroyed in those two categoriesÂ  In Game 7 what do you guys have to do to change that?",
        "9": "LeBron, your coach was in here just a while ago and Erik mentioned, something he said, you guys will remember this 20 years from nowÂ  Getting to play in a game like that."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Explain it?Ã‚Â  You seen itÂ  It was total domination by the Pacers in the thirdÂ  They made a lot of shotsÂ  We didn't get too many stopsÂ  And we missed some very, very easy shotsÂ  Dâ€‘Wade had a chippy in transitionÂ  Rio had a chippy in transitionÂ  We bobbled a turnover on a threeâ€‘onâ€‘one breakÂ  CB had a couple of good looksÂ  They pushed it up. It just needed one quarterÂ  One quarter to separate the two teamsÂ  23â€‘21 firstÂ  17â€‘18 second, 23â€‘22 fourthÂ  And you know, 29â€‘15 in that thirdÂ  That was the separation.",
        "1": "NoÂ  NoÂ  I believe in my teammatesÂ  They are struggling right now, obviouslyÂ  So they got another opportunity on Monday, and I look forward to the challengeÂ  I know they do as well.",
        "2": "I mean, obviously it's a little bit of bothÂ  They're two great playersÂ  When they don't shoot well or play well, it's more themÂ  It's not taking no discredit away from Indiana's defense; they were amazing tonightÂ  They forced us to have more turnovers than assistsÂ  And we only shot 36% from the floor. But I think Dwyane and Chris have seen every defense ever been applied to them in their tenâ€‘year career, and they've been able to figure it outÂ  This one just took a little longer.",
        "3": "I had to run down the court to stop from being kicked outÂ  I thought it was a pretty bad callÂ  I don't complain about calls too muchÂ  I thought me and Hibbert met at the mountaintopÂ  I didn't throw an elbowÂ  Basically I went straight upÂ  And I knew he was going to go high hands, like he had been doingÂ  So I went to a doubleâ€‘clutch to try to let him go downÂ  Then I was able to go over the topÂ  I don't have no idea why that was called an offensive foul. So, you know, just stopped me from being ejectedÂ  I think at that moment I just got away from the ref that called it.",
        "4": "I said absolutely nothingÂ  I ran down the court to get me away from the scene of the crime, I guess.",
        "5": "I may have to look over the filmÂ  I am able to replay a lot of plays in my headÂ  I know for him I know he missed a couple of chippies that he wished he could get backÂ  He had a layâ€‘up or two layâ€‘ups in the third, pretty good ones, pretty good looks, some looks he hadn't had all seriesÂ  He went around Hibbert I think and he missed one at the rim, it rimmed outÂ  He had another one that rimmed out for him as wellÂ  I know he wish he could get those backÂ  Those are rhythm plays for anyoneÂ  When you're struggling, the best thing to get is a layâ€‘up or a dunkÂ  He missed a couple of them. So I can go over the filmÂ  I will watch the film tonight and I will watch it tomorrow and see ways that we can try to help him get on trackÂ  That will be great for our team.",
        "6": "I mean, we can state the obvious; they're both strugglingÂ  Chris is struggling with his shot, and him hurting his ankle didn't help him a lot as wellÂ  I think he will find itÂ  He will find itÂ  It's my job as a leader to keep him motivated, to let him know how important he is to our movement, to our chances of returning to The Finals. The best thing about this opportunity is right here we worked all season long to get homeâ€‘court advantageÂ  If we ever had an opportunity or we put ourselves in position where we weren't taking care of business on the road, we always have one more to fall back on at homeÂ  This is the position we're in and those guys as professionals, as champions, we'll figure it outÂ  And me as the leader, I'll have to help them figure it out.",
        "7": "It's going to be toughÂ  I probably won't be able to relax just because of the excitement of having the Game 7 in our building, the opportunity to go to the NBA FinalsÂ  I probably will not be able to relax until the game startsÂ  It's an opportunity for usÂ  And like I said, that's why we had the best record in the league forÂ  If we didn't take care of business on the road at some point in the playoffs, we can always fall back on this. We'd hate to be in this position, but it's an opportunity and we look forward to it on Monday, I believe.",
        "8": "Do the opposite of what you just said.",
        "9": "It's not promisedÂ  Each and every year there are 30 teams that would love to be a part of thisÂ  To have one game to advance to the NBA FinalsÂ  And there's two teams that's in this positionÂ  And it's something that you can't substitute this feelingÂ  You can't substitute the atmosphere that we're going to be in on Monday night for both teamsÂ  We should all cherish this moment. At the end of the day, go out and play, have funÂ  It's just a game of basketballÂ  That's all it isÂ  It's just a game of basketball at the end of the dayÂ  Thanks.

        "1": "Dwyane was talking about it a minute agoÂ  When he's not 100%, what do you have to do to kind of make up for the things that he's not able to do and how does that broaden the work?",
        "2": "You mentioned last night you did have to take on more, reference to your Cleveland daysÂ  Do you think that might have to be the way it goes from here on out the rest of the series?",
        "3": "When guys antagonize you, is that like waking up a sleeping giant?",
        "4": "How do you balance that when guys are really trying to get under your skin?",
        "5": "When you get in that mode, though, do you even remember today what you were yelling at Lance?",
        "6": "Going into Indiana's hostile environment, what is the game plan?",
        "7": "In the second half last night you guys were shooting a lot more over them instead of driving to the basketÂ  Is that something you're going to try to implement going into tomorrow night as well?",
        "8": "With the Spurs sitting there, is it impossible not to think about them at all?",
        "9": "What are you doing to stay focused?",
        "10": "LeBron, with their size, do you think this might be the toughest matchâ€‘up for Chris out there in terms of the Eastern Conference teams?",
        "11": "You've been the Heat's most reliable threeâ€‘point shooter this seriesÂ  Have you had to maybe step it up a little bit with some of the other shooters not hitting as well as they usually do?",
        "12": "What do you remember in terms of when you walked away from the 2007 Finals, your first trip, your first experience, your first disappointment there?Ã‚Â  Was there anything you left knowing that night, that series?",
        "13": "Did you know even then that maybe there was going to be a time you were just looking acrossâ€‘â€‘ you were facing Duncan and Ginobili and Parkerâ€‘â€‘ that you were going to need more maybe to be able to overcome a team like that or to make those repeat trips that you now have made?",
        "14": "Do you remember some of the things that Duncan said to you then?",
        "15": "LeBron, can you talk about having to match their desperation?Ã‚Â  Obviously they are going to come out desperate in this gameÂ  Can you talk about having to match that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "First of all, it's tough to win a playoff game, periodÂ  I think the closeout game is always the toughestÂ  You add you're on the road, you're out of your comfort, and it makes it a little tougher. But for us it's a challengeÂ  It's another challenge that we thrive on and we like, and we'll just try to take advantage of it.",
        "1": "I just do meÂ  I understand that he's not 100% and he's giving us everything that he hasÂ  I got to just be meÂ  Go out and just try to lead our teamÂ  (Indiscernible).",
        "2": "I don't knowÂ  I played that by our firstâ€‘half performanceÂ  I didn't like the way we were playing in our firstâ€‘half performanceÂ  So I went into halftime and said that's what I need to be in the second halfÂ  I was able to do that in the third quarter and for the rest of the game. But I think every game is differentÂ  Every game presents new challenges and different circumstances.",
        "3": "I accept itÂ  I love that type of challengeÂ  I don't shy away from itÂ  I think it's greatÂ  It brings emotions to the gameÂ  Guys are being competitiveÂ  I'm all for itÂ  I can do bothÂ  I can talk and I can play at the same time.",
        "4": "You can't do thatÂ  No way you can get under my skinÂ  I understand what the ultimate task isÂ  I'm able to do multiple things and still be able to concentrate at the task at hand.",
        "5": "NoÂ  Absolutely notÂ  NoÂ  You know, just letting the game speak for itself, I guess.",
        "6": "It's the sameÂ  We want to be very aggressive offensively and defensively, rebound the ball, not turn the ball over on the road, and try to get good shotsÂ  If we can take care of our keys going into every game, we give ourselves a good chance to win.",
        "7": "We took the shots that we hadÂ  We didn't overâ€‘attack, that we've been doing at some points some gamesÂ  The shots that we had we took them. We're a really good shooting team, both from outside and the midâ€‘rangeÂ  The midâ€‘range was there for us last nightÂ  And Ray was able to hit a couple of threes.",
        "8": "Yeah, I mean, we know who is the Western Conference ChampionsÂ  We're focused on that Indiana group, understanding the opportunity that we haveÂ  So we look forward to tomorrow night.",
        "9": "I don't know.",
        "10": "I don't knowÂ  It's a question for Chris.",
        "11": "NoÂ  For me I can do a little bit of everythingÂ  I can shoot from outside, score on the paint, I can score from midâ€‘rangeÂ  You know, I'm not trying to compensate for anyoneÂ  I'm just trying to do my part, and even do a little bit moreÂ  Just try to help.",
        "12": "That I hope I get another opportunityÂ  I know it's not promisedÂ  It was like, wow, that was a great experience for our teamÂ  I know at that moment I didn't want that to be the last opportunity I had in The Finals.",
        "13": "ObviouslyÂ  Obviously I needed moreÂ  Our team, we were really good, but we weren't greatÂ  And that was a great teamÂ  We lost to a better teamÂ  So I understand that we needed moreÂ  We continued to get better over the years, but we never got to that level.",
        "14": "NoÂ  NoÂ  Not besides seeing the stuff on NBA Television and stuff like thatÂ  Not really.",
        "15": "We're desperate tooÂ  We're desperate to get back to the NBA FinalsÂ  So both teams are desperate in their own sense that they are trying to keep their season alive, and we're trying to advanceÂ  We'll see which one clashes the best. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, sort of one question in two parts:Ã‚Â  Can you sort of take us through the Juwan throwing and yelling various things at halftime and what you reiterated before the third quarter?Ã‚Â  Just what that third quarter felt like for you, even though you've been in that moment so many times.",
        "1": "LeBron, in the third quarter there did it reach a point where you sort of realized, for whatever reason, it wasn't going to be Dwyane's game, it wasn't going to be Chris's game, maybe instead of equal opportunity, that's just when you had to go and make it your game?",
        "2": "LeBron, Dwyane Wade said after the game that you were perhaps the most vocal maybe since you've been here to rally the troopsÂ  He even punched his fists towards his hand to say how you wereÂ  Is that an accurate characterization?",
        "3": "It seemed like you had a little extra edge out there with Lance Stephenson tonight.",
        "4": "LeBron, you and Udonis both mentioned you guys only had 40 points in the first halfÂ  What went on in the first half that you guys were so upset with and knew you needed to change?",
        "5": "The last couple of games in particular Mario has been going to the rim pretty consistently and finding creases, getting layâ€‘ups and stuff like thatÂ  Have you had a conversation with him about that?Ã‚Â  Or anybody?Ã‚Â  It seems he has been as aggressive as we've seen him all year.",
        "6": "LeBron, you said you went back to your Cleveland daysÂ  What made you think and know that that was the right move for tonight and that your team needed that from you?",
        "7": "Your flurry of jumpshots at the end of the third quarter came after Udonis's confrontation with David WestÂ  Any coincidence with that or did that stir something inside of you that was waiting to come out?",
        "8": "You've been here a few times, obviously, but does the realization set in yet that you're one win away from getting back to The Finals?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Juwan's voice in our locker room on the floor is as big as anyoneÂ  As big as Spo, as big as mine, UD, Dâ€‘WadeÂ  That's why we brought him back because he's an instrumental part of our team. He got us on at halftime, letting us know how we weren't connected as a team, we weren't playing as a teamÂ  We were wasting an opportunity. At the beginning of the third, I just tried to reiterate that in my own words, and get on the guys and just let them know we can't just win with talentÂ  We are playing a great teamÂ  Luckily we were only down four at halftime, at the halfÂ  We had to play with a little more sense of urgency, well, a lot more sense of urgency in the second half, if we wanted to win that game.",
        "1": "Yeah, I kind of just went back to my Cleveland days at that point and just said, hey, let's try to make more plays and be more of a scoring threat as well, and just try to figure out a way that I canâ€‘â€‘ I don't know, just see if the guys would just follow me, and just lead them the best way I could. I was just in attack mode in the third quarter, look for my shotÂ  And luckily I was able to make some.",
        "2": "Well, I mean Dâ€‘Wade is not a liar, so..Â  If he said it, it happenedÂ  I have a big voice in our locker roomÂ  I have a big voice on this teamÂ  I sensed what was going on with our team, you know, in the first halfÂ  And before we took the floor in the third quarter, I just gave them a little piece of my mind and a piece of my voice, and we was able to respond.",
        "3": "YeahÂ  As a competitor you love challenges, and Lance is one of those guys who likes to talk someÂ  And I'm for it, tooÂ  I really don't start it, but if it gets started, then I love to do itÂ  It's cool. I think it's greatÂ  It shows a competitive spirit between two individuals, between two teams to go out there and just try to figure out ways to help their team win. But I'm all for it if it's there.",
        "4": "We just had no sense of urgencyÂ  We were just waiting for the game to change instead of going to get itÂ  Instead of going to make plays and make things happen and make changes, we were waiting for things to happen. We made a great run to actually tie it at 40â€‘40, but they went on on a 4â€‘0 run to end the halfÂ  There was a few plays in the first half that were just like, didn't make any sense to usÂ  Didn't make any sense to me and to some of the guys, like a couple of plays we know we're capable of making that we just wasn't makingÂ  And it had nothing to do with X's and O'sÂ  It was about a sense of urgencyÂ  I think we all sensed that, we all felt thatÂ  I am glad we were able to turn it around.",
        "5": "Yeah, I haveÂ  I talked to him before the game todayÂ  I talked to him after shootâ€‘around this morningÂ  Letting him know where he can be aggressive, where he can make plays not only for himself but for our teammates in certain situationsÂ  Most of his possessions are coming off 1â€‘3 pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll with me and himÂ  I just tell him just to use meÂ  My man is sometimes kind of in between of trying to help on the point guard and not help as much off of meÂ  So that gives Rio a lot of creases. Rio has done a great job of using me as a screen or to get in the paint, either make plays for himself or for teammates.",
        "6": "I just seen how we were playing in the first halfÂ  Like I said, we were in wait mode in the first half instead of going and getting itÂ  Just waiting for things to happenÂ  I took it upon myself to stop waiting and just goÂ  Just try to figure out a way to go and get itÂ  I don't know, I just stepped outside the box a little bit and UD was amazingÂ  I mean with his ability to shoot the ball as well and finish around the rim. As one of the leaders on the team, I just tried to do whatever it takes to try help those guys to try to follow me and lead them to the right place.",
        "7": "No, I don't think soÂ  I think UD is, like I said, he's our heartbeatÂ  Any time there's a confrontation, if he's on the floor, he goes to protect. We're not going to let anybody talk down on our point guardÂ  He's one of the smallest guys on our teamÂ  UD was there to protect himÂ  I was just trying to take advantage of what I seen after that pointÂ  I don't think the confrontation had anything to do with itÂ  I think the emotions of being in a Game 5 with the series tied 2â€‘2 on our home floor and being able to make plays had everythingÂ  That's where the emotion came fromÂ  I'm blessed I was able to make a few plays.",
        "8": "That's what I came here forÂ  That's what I came here for, is to be able to compete for a championship each and every yearÂ  We are one step away from doing it once again. But it's not a promiseÂ  It's not promised at allÂ  I made a tough decision, obviouslyÂ  I think we all know the storyÂ  I'm not going to harp on thatÂ  I envisioned something that was bigger as far as a teamÂ  Sacrificed a lot for me individually, what I had going on in the summer of 2010 because I wanted to do something special with a teamÂ  And we got an opportunity as a team once again for the third year straight to make a trip to the NBA FinalsÂ  But we have to try to go out on the road in a hostile environment and take it.

        "1": "Can you talk about your guys' execution tonightÂ  Was it a matter of them stepping up defensively?Ã‚Â  Was it a matter of not getting to what you wanted to?Ã‚Â  It seemed like it wasn't as fluid as it was when you guys were playing better.",
        "2": "LeBron, they were trying to give you a lot of different looks tonightÂ  Can you just talk about the job that Lance Stephenson did and what he tried to do against you.",
        "3": "It seemed like you guys answered each one of their runs every time they made oneÂ  The last three or four minutes you guys scored three points the rest of the wayÂ  What happened with the offense at that point?",
        "4": "LeBron, you guys got beat on the glass pretty goodÂ  In all 49â€‘30 and then beat in the paint pretty good, 50â€‘32, but you only lost by seven pointsÂ  I know a loss is a loss, but how much confidence does that give you guys going back to Miami?",
        "5": "LeBron, you competed against Stephenson a number of timesÂ  His teammates were saying he wanted and asked to guard you in this game, especially when George got in foul trouble, but even beforeÂ  With a kind of impact did he have overall on the outcome of this game?",
        "6": "LeBron, how much did the foul trouble sort of keep you out of your rhythm?Ã‚Â  And what did you think about the sixth foul?",
        "7": "As a followâ€‘up, even in games you guys won, Roy Hibbert was still a problemÂ  What do you have to do to sort of compete with him a little better the rest of the series?",

        "1": "That's obviousÂ  They did a good job of taking away our first optionÂ  Sometimes our second optionÂ  I believe though we had some really good looks and some of them just didn't go downÂ  You give a lot of credit to their D.",
        "2": "As a team they D'ed in on me, especially in the low postÂ  But for me, I've seen every defense, I've seen every individualÂ  I was able to get it going a little bit in the second halfÂ  I played mostly with foul trouble.",
        "3": "I thought we got some great looksÂ  I thought CB had a great look by their bench, a threeâ€‘pointerÂ  I thought Dâ€‘Wade was going to get a good look on my offensive foulÂ  You know, you give some credit to them for sure, for holding us to only three pointsÂ  But some of the shots that we had just didn't go down.",
        "4": "We can't afford to get beat on the glass by 20Â  Can't happenÂ  It allows them to get secondâ€‘chance pointsÂ  Then they shot the ball from the field 50%Â  As a collective group, we can't allow that. But we don't need confidence to go into any gameÂ  We're a confident bunchÂ  We're excited to get the opportunity to go back to our home and play Game 5.",
        "5": "I thought, I mean, offensively he played extremely wellÂ  He attacked usÂ  He got some offensive reboundsÂ  He got one offensive rebound for a tipâ€‘backÂ  I think he played wellÂ  He played really wellÂ  But if you are sitting here and talking about an individual oneâ€‘onâ€‘one matchâ€‘up between me and Lance Stephenson, I'm not going to harp on that.",
        "6": "I didn't believe it was an offensive foulÂ  I was going to set a screen, and I felt like I was stationaryÂ  And Dâ€‘Wade rejected the pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollÂ  Lance actually ran into meÂ  I believe I was straight up and down on Paul George's drive, on the andâ€‘oneÂ  Hibbert, they reversed a call with Hibbert, called a foul for me on that oneÂ  And at the end of the third they called a pushâ€‘off on David West in the end of the third. It was a couple of calls that I didn't feel like were fouls, personal fouls on meÂ  That's how the game goes sometimes.",
        "7": "He's playing wellÂ  He has his jumpâ€‘hook goingÂ  I think we just got to try to clean up some of those offensive rebounds that he's getting, because he's going to make some shots in the low postÂ  We're playing some great defense, getting them down to late secondsÂ  One that sticks out in my mind tonight is the long heave three by Paul George that went off the backboard, and he got the offensive reboundÂ  That was a bigâ€‘time playÂ  I think I fouled him on that to give him a threeâ€‘point play. And then there's a couple of other onesÂ  He's so big and being around the rim, he's able to get a lot of offensive reboundsÂ  If we can cut that in half, it would help us out a lot.",
        "8": "YeahÂ  We wanted to be greedy and get twoÂ  We were able to come here and regain home courtÂ  We feel good about thatÂ  It's a threeâ€‘game series with two on our home floor, if neededÂ  We look forward to Game 5.",
        "9": "Dâ€‘Wade told me about it todayÂ  Obviously I'm not on social media right now during the playoffsÂ  Dâ€‘Wade came to me with the story today, and it was a noâ€‘brainer for meÂ  It's sadÂ  It puts everything in perspectiveÂ  At the end of the day, this game is just basketballÂ  Two great teams, we're competingÂ  But it's just basketballÂ  You have a little girl or any kid that loses her life over an illness, it's very sadÂ  It's very sad. It puts everything in perspectiveÂ  I understand that this game is so magnified, and this is the talk of a lot of people throughout the dayÂ  But what happened to Bella puts everything in perspective.

        "1": "5â€‘0 on the road, and all of those wins by double digitsÂ  Why do you guys seem to play so well away from home?",
        "2": "What's more satisfying, having 20,000 at home cheering for you or quieting 20,000 on the road?",
        "3": "Are you able to maintain the same sort of desperation you had when it was 1â€‘1 or when you were down in all those series last year?Ã‚Â  Is that the next step for this team, not to make it hard on yourself like you were when you trailed the last three rounds?",
        "4": "What adjustments do you expect tomorrow from them?",
        "5": "How much do you think the early shooting kind of sparked this team?",
        "6": "Do you feel when you have a lot of success in one area of the game, maybe teams overreact the next game, as far as something else?",
        "7": "I know you do the prep beforehandÂ  Did you get a sense first quarter, starting to play in the post â€‘â€‘",
        "8": "How does that first half rank in your overall offensive execution?",
        "9": "How patient would you say you were in the post last night?Ã‚Â  How much time did they give you to kind of make your move?",
        "10": "When you do bounce it five, six times, how much better of a rhythm do you get in than when you have to bounce and shoot?",
        "11": "In your experience, is there much carryâ€‘over from one playoff game to the next one?",
        "12": "Do you find when you have a good offensive rhythm, it tends to start carrying over in the series?",
        "13": "Do you get the sense that you feel Rio and Dwyane also were able to have a little bounce and get to the cup andâ€‘â€‘",
        "14": "With the steps the league took this year to curtail flopping, what's your feeling on how well it's worked?",

        "0": "I play all overÂ  I play in the post, I play in the pointÂ  Whatever the game presents itself, that's what I do.",
        "1": "I just think it the adversity, the opponents' fans, that we love to just come in and try to take a game from a team on their home floorÂ  We love itÂ  We love feeling like it's just us by ourselves and against everyone elseÂ  The challenge we're always up for.",
        "2": "I mean, we love our fans for sureÂ  I've always personally loved getting a road win.",
        "3": "The playoffs is hardÂ  If you're up or down, you have to win four gamesÂ  We understand that, so we look forward to the opportunity, having another game where we can win, take a commanding leadÂ  So we look forward to it tomorrow night.",
        "4": "I don't knowÂ  We'll see what happens once we get out on the floorÂ  This is a game of adjustmentsÂ  Whatever adjustments they make, we'll be able to counter it.",
        "5": "That goes without sayingÂ  Production offense last night was good for usÂ  We're going to continue to need that.",
        "6": "It's pick your poison, honestlyÂ  If you're going to double me, I'll find my shootersÂ  If you're going to play me oneâ€‘onâ€‘one, I'm going to be aggressive and look for my shot. I'm an unselfish guyÂ  If they try to come on the post and take the ball away from me, I'm going to look weak sideÂ  Try to find my shooters, try to find my bigs on the baselineÂ  If not, I'm going to go to work.",
        "7": "I just read the gameÂ  I see how they're playing me in the post, seeing if they are allowing me to get multiple dribbles down there or if they come right awayÂ  I just see what the game gives me, see what the game takes, and I go from there.",
        "8": "It's the best we've had in the playoffs for sure this yearÂ  To score 70 points, especially against a team like this that defends so wellÂ  It was big time.",
        "9": "I was very patientÂ  I understand what the defense was giving me, what I can take advantage ofÂ  Just try to be aggressive, put a lot of pressure on their defense.",
        "10": "I feel like I'm always in rhythm, honestlyÂ  If it takes five or if it takes me one, I'm in rhythmÂ  Just being aggressive is something I always want to continue to do",
        "11": "Absolutely, there can beÂ  Dependent on how you play one game or how you didn't it can beÂ  Sometimes it works out that way; sometimes it don'tÂ  But, yes, you can have carryâ€‘over from one game to the next.",
        "12": "I feel like last night was the first time in probablyâ€‘â€‘ I don't knowâ€‘â€‘ a long time that we got to what we doÂ  We shot the ball extremely well from the outsideÂ  We got our paint points. That's what we've done all yearÂ  That's why we have the best record in the leagueÂ  That's why we led the league in field goal percentageÂ  We felt like we was going to have one of those breakout gamesÂ  And hopefully we can continue that tomorrow.",
        "13": "AbsolutelyÂ  (Indiscernible) it started with UD, UD making those shots, bringing Hibbert out a little bit moreÂ  They took him off of CBÂ  He thought he could get closer to the rimÂ  Then UD started knocking down jumpersÂ  I started working the paintÂ  And then once Dâ€‘Wadeâ€‘â€‘ Rio seen he was open, they started attacking and put a lot of pressure on the defense.",
        "14": "I mean, it hasn't been a problem (Indiscernible) at allÂ  I haven't paid too much attention to itÂ  I think teams still do it, I guess.",
        "15": "Yeah, it's year oneÂ  Not just going to go cold turkeyÂ  Some guys have been doing it for years, just trying to get an advantageÂ  Any way you can get an advantage over the opponent to help your team win, sobeitÂ  It's year oneÂ  It still happensÂ  Definitely been less than years previous.",
        "16": "Much better than a few years agoÂ  But I still have a lot of room to improveÂ  A few things I can still get better with down thereÂ  Small counterâ€‘attacksÂ  Feeling the defense out a little bit more with my back towards the basketÂ  I can work down low (Indiscernible)Ã‚Â  that's something I couldn't do probably just two years ago.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, could you talk about your approach in the post todayÂ  Was it something you went over with the coaching staff?Ã‚Â  Erik said they wanted to get the ball deeperÂ  Or was it something you watched film and you decided it's something you can do with Paul to give you guys an advantage?",
        "2": "Can you guys explain why you think you're so good coming off losses in the playoffs over the last few years?",
        "3": "LeBron, Hibbert was in here taking responsibility for not helping Paul George more when you would go into the postÂ  What did you see in the ways that they did try to defend you?Ã‚Â  And what did that open up for the rest of your offense?",
        "4": "Question for both of you guys:Ã‚Â  Hibbert said the game plan for them was make the big three do all the work and limit the other guysÂ  And clearly when he said \"other guys,\" he was thinking threeâ€‘point shootersÂ  How did Udonis become the key for you guys in this game?",
        "6": "LeBron, in the second quarter, that's when you guys put the distance between yourselves and the PacersÂ  Talk about the keys to making that happenÂ  And then Dwyane, talk about the ability to make that thing stand up for the rest of the second half.",
        "7": "The latter part of that third quarter, the Pacers, you could see the body language of the Pacers just start to fall apartÂ  Did you guys see that and then take advantage of it?",
        "9": "Dwyane, how was the knee today?Ã‚Â  Did it feel better?Ã‚Â  Can you talk to us how it's affected you this series?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I think it was a little bit of everythingÂ  I made a conscious effort to sit down in the post tonight, try to put pressure on the defenseÂ  Spo and the coaching staff wanted me to be down there tonight, and my teammates allowed me to do thatÂ  It was a little bit of everything.",
        "2": "We wish we can not come off losses, but it happensÂ  It happens in the playoffsÂ  That's what playoff basketball is all aboutÂ  But we're a team who just bounces back from diversityÂ  We love the fact that you know they took the home court away from us, and now let's see what we are made ofÂ  I think we know what we're made of as well. This is a great group of guys that always loved, I think, the pressure moments of being, I guess, 1â€‘1, a team taking our home court awayÂ  And we have to go on the road to win. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  To add to that, I also think once you come off a loss, when you win, a lot of things are massedÂ  You don't really look at everything once you winÂ  But once you lose, you get to break down everythingÂ  I think our attention to detail coming off a loss is a lot betterÂ  We're a mature team and once the coaches put the game plan in front of us, once they point the mistakes, et cetera in front of us, we take it for what it is, we try to correct it. I think our attention to detail is what's important in it.",
        "3": "Well, I mean, I seen I had a oneâ€‘onâ€‘one matchâ€‘upÂ  They didn't come down in the post all game, so I just tried to take advantage of itÂ  My teammates gave me spaceÂ  I just tried to sit in the post, not get the ball in the wing as much tonightÂ  Tried to anchor myself down on the block and go to workÂ  I was able to do that.",
        "4": "He's always the keyÂ  He's the heartbeat of our team, first of allÂ  He's the captain, one of the captains of our teamÂ  There's no one in our roster that plays that goes out there and we don't have the utmost confidence in their ability. For him to come through tonight and do what he was able to do offensively from the start, Rio stepping it up in the third, also Shane and Ray contributing, Bird giving his usualÂ  We needed everyone's effort tonight, and it allowed us to get a big win on the road.",
        "6": "Well, we have to get stops, first of allÂ  The 34â€‘30 first quarter was something both teams are not accustomed to doing, being defensiveâ€‘minded teamsÂ  But we had to get stops, we had to rebound and then we had to executeÂ  We went from a 34â€‘point quarter to a 36â€‘point quarterÂ  It just showed the ball movement that we had. And also not turning the ball over; we had five turnovers for the whole game, and that's big timeÂ  Especially on the roadÂ  We're a team who doesn't turn the ball over a lot, but when you have under 10, you're going to give yourself an unbelievable chance to winÂ  To have five turnovers on the road in a tough building was bigâ€‘time for our team tonight. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  I think that as LeBron just alluded to, what we did by not turning the ball over was we let them see our halfâ€‘court defenseÂ  That's keyÂ  They didn't get a lot of transition buckets, because we didn't turn the ball overÂ  We was able to set our defenseÂ  When we set our defense, we're a pretty good defensive team. Also we were very efficient on the offensive endÂ  We got the shots that we wanted, we neededÂ  We moved the ball aroundÂ  We got to a lot of postâ€‘ups, a lot of different thingsÂ  So I think even when they made their run, we continued to work the game that worked for us in the beginningÂ  But most importantly it was all about the defensive end, not turning the ball over, so they can see all five of us on the other end of the floor.",
        "7": "We just wanted to keep putting the pressure on themÂ  We scored 70 points in the first half, and we knew they were going to make a runÂ  That's a really good teamÂ  We knew they were going to make a runÂ  They didÂ  They cut the lead to seven in the thirdÂ  Right after that I think Rio got an andâ€‘one to put us back up 10. We wanted to try to continue to put the pressure on them, continue to execute offensively, not turn the ball over, get stops defensivelyÂ  And we could see their body language start to change a little bitÂ  That's when we just keep goingÂ  Just keep going and not play the score, not play the leadÂ  Just play the gameÂ  Understand every possession matters, every possession countsÂ  At the end of the game we see what happensÂ  We were able to continue to do that and come out with a wellâ€‘needed win.",
        "9": "His knee is fineÂ  We don't need to talk about the kneeÂ  In the lineup, he good. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  Good to go. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "0": "LeBron, can you take us through obviously the final two plays, those sequences, what you saw and what happened.",
        "1": "How surprising was that to you?Ã‚Â  Maybe one, but not twoÂ  And what's the sort of disappointment feeling right now after two plays like that?",
        "2": "LeBron, emotionally, how do you sort of go from what happened in Game 1 with you winning it in the final seconds, to sort of stumbling in Game 2?",
        "3": "LeBron, you had what looked like a respectful exchange with Paul at the end of the third quarterÂ  When you have a little backâ€‘andâ€‘forth with a guy and you're pushing a guy in a night like this, it seems to take your game to another level.",
        "4": "LeBron, you've lost home court, obviouslyÂ  The outside shot just isn't there from guys who have been hitting it all yearÂ  What's the level of concern right now as you head up to Indy for Game 3?",
        "5": "I know you're right in the middle of a series right now, but you've been where Paul George was in terms of becoming whatever it is you're going to beÂ  What's the next step for a young guy with talent, with the work ethic to take that next level to be an elite player?",
        "6": "Your team was in a similar position last year going up there 1â€‘1Â  I know the circumstances are different; Chris is healthy right nowÂ  Can you draw anything from going up to that building with the 1â€‘1 situation?",
        "7": "LeBron, just when we thought there was nothing new to say about the way you've been playing lately, George Hill a minute ago said, quote, \"There's only one person scarier than him and that was God.\"Ã‚Â  That's youÂ  What do you think about that description?",
        "8": "LeBron, because you do take such pride in not turning the ball over, and to do it twice in such a key moment, how much more does this hurt than just other kinds of physical mistakes that you could possibly have made in a game this big?",
        "9": "LeBron, you are focusing on the missed opportunities on offenseÂ  They also came in here and shot 50% in your buildingÂ  How disappointing is that?",
        "10": "Can you take us through those last few possessions, from theâ€‘â€‘",
        "11": "From the perspective of where Roy Hibbert was, because Chris Bosh was on the perimeterÂ  Was he able to successfully split between the basket and Bosh so he wasn't open?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "First one, Ray came to set a pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll in the first one, and David West basically just put his hands up and he was able to get his hands on the ballÂ  A little careless on my part obviously. And then the second goâ€‘round, I was able to get in the lane, I spun and I seen Ray once again wide open and I was careless once againÂ  I had the lane for RayÂ  I maybe should have jumpâ€‘passed it over the topÂ  I tried to throw it through the lane, and they was able to get the hand on it again. Can't happen in that situationÂ  Especially being down two in a big game.",
        "1": "Very disappointing, of course, for meÂ  That's the first thing I always look at on the stat sheet is my turnoversÂ  I had two key ones at a big point of the gameÂ  I am very disappointed in my judgment and my plays down the stretchÂ  But I'll make up for them.",
        "2": "I get ready for Game 3, like I did in Game 1 and Game 2Â  I didn't have any emotions after making the gameâ€‘winner in Game 1Â  We won one game and tonight we lost oneÂ  So emotionally I'm still at the same level I've been atÂ  We had an opportunity, but they played well enough to win Game 2.",
        "3": "We're just two guys trying to do what it takes to help our team winÂ  He's really goodÂ  He's going to be a great oneÂ  His maturity and his game has definitely risen in just one year because of the opportunity Frank Vogel has given himÂ  His teammates have a lot of confidence in him, and he has confidence in himself. I love competitionÂ  I try to step up to the challenge and try to be there for my team as well.",
        "4": "I think the outside shot isn't there for the guys who have been hitting all year for a couple of reasons; the rhythmÂ  We have to figure out a way to get our shooters into the game more instead of trying to get them the ball and make them make a tough one late in the game for Ray or from Rio or from ShaneÂ  We have to figure out how to get them some shots early in the game, where they feel like they're part of the offenseÂ  That has to come from me, come from Dâ€‘Wade, come from CBÂ  We're the three guys that have the ball in our hands a lotÂ  Try to get our shooters in the game early. We know they've been there for us all yearÂ  We're going to continue to have confidence in themÂ  We know it'll help us out a lot. I think having them a part of the flow offensively, they'll feel like they're part of the offense, they'll be there late for us.",
        "5": "I mean, I know the answer to thatÂ  I'm not going to say it right now while I'm competing against the guyÂ  He may try to use that during our matchâ€‘up right now. I know the answer to thatÂ  I'll answer it after the series.",
        "6": "Just our experiences over the yearsÂ  We've had home court and we lost a game at homeÂ  But like I said, every game, every series is differentÂ  We will figure out ways what we could have did betterÂ  Tonight we had some opportunitiesÂ  We had some really, really good opportunities tonightÂ  One that sticks out in my head a couple of plays, I think we were up four, got a stop, CB got a good look at a threeÂ  We missed itÂ  Then Lance Stephenson I think hit a threeÂ  If CB makes that, it may be a different ballgame. Also getting another stop and Rio having a clean look from the corner. But I mean, there are experiences over the year, we just stay even keeledÂ  We don't get too high, we don't get too low in the seriesÂ  We know we're going to go into a hostile environment against a very good team, and we look forward to the challenge.",
        "7": "I'm nowhere near closeÂ  I made two mistakes tonightÂ  That hurt our teamÂ  And that hurt more than anythingÂ  Let my teammates downÂ  They expect me to make plays down the stretch, and I had the ballwith the opportunity to make a couple of plays and I came up shortÂ  That burns. But the best thing about it is this isn't collegeÂ  It's not one loss and you're doneÂ  I have another opportunity to get better in Game 3, and if I'm put in that position again, to be able to learn from it.",
        "8": "My turnovers hurt more than anythingÂ  I think the careless turnoversÂ  My mind seen the right play in my head; two guys on the ball, Ray Allen is openÂ  But if I could take it back, I would maybe throw the bounce pass on the first one, because David West had high handsÂ  And on the second one I would still make the same play, but I would probably jump pass over the defense instead of going through the lane, the passing lane. When I took the spin on Paul George, I seen Ray wide openÂ  So I tried to throw the ball through the lane, through the passing lane instead of doing the jump passÂ  And I would have been able to complete it. Me turning the ball over, no matter what point of the game, but especially like tonight, with us down to a oneâ€‘possession game, those hurt more than anything, more than missing a free throw, more than missing a shot, more than anything.",
        "9": "It is disappointingÂ  But at the end of the day, we had a chance to winÂ  We still had a chance to winÂ  I thought Hibbert was big tonightÂ  Every time we kind of made a run, he was able to make some big shotsÂ  Especially in the fourth quarterÂ  He had his jumpâ€‘hook going, he had his rolls going. I thought George Hill was the X factor tonightÂ  18 points, hit some big shots, some big freeâ€‘throwsÂ  Just kept them above water. We can't allow 50% on our floorÂ  But at the end of the day, it was 40 points in the paintÂ  It was 9â€‘8 secondâ€‘chance points, 8â€‘6 fastâ€‘break pointsÂ  We had 14 turnovers; they had 13Â  It was a pretty much even gameÂ  And they just made one more play, or two more plays than we made down the stretch.",
        "10": "Again?",
        "11": "NoÂ  NoÂ  The first play, like I said, I was careless with itÂ  I threw it back to RayÂ  He was openÂ  I was still on the perimeterÂ  Hibbert was not even aroundÂ  The second play I drove and I spun away from Hibbert, and seen Ray and turned the ball over. So, no, he wasn't a distraction for me at all. THE MODERATOR:Ã‚Â  Thank you, LeBron. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "We know we can get betterÂ  We watched the filmÂ  We had 20â€‘plus turnovers, which is uncharacteristic of usÂ  Some miscues defensivelyÂ  And they can say the same thingÂ  You know, they had 20â€‘plus as well. We know we can play betterÂ  That's why each game is its own, and you try to learn from your mistakes in the previous game.",
        "2": "Yeah, I think soÂ  He's going to be (Indiscernible) in our leagueÂ  Just the opportunityÂ  His team has given him the confidence, and him having the confidence in himself.",

        "4": "Yeah, we had an opportunity to see it today, to see the executionÂ  I'm just blessed to be able to cover that much ground in two seconds, to be able to throw the card in my head, knowing I can get from the top of the freeâ€‘throw line to the rimÂ  It was great.",
        "5": "You continue to learn about a team each and every gameÂ  You continue to know what they like, what they dislike, how comfortable they are in certain situationsÂ  And also in individual matchâ€‘ups tooÂ  That's what the series is all aboutÂ  It's a feelâ€‘out processÂ  Hopefully along that feelâ€‘out process you get wins.",

        "0": "LeBron, the final sequence, including whether the play changed after the timeout by the Pacers, if you were surprised that Hibbert wasn't in there?Ã‚Â  And just your thought process on the play, please.",
        "1": "LeBron, the decision there, once you were on the court and to basically go left, to have a step, did you ever think you may have to pull up in that situation?Ã‚Â  Paul said maybe he should have played off of you a little bit, force you to shoot the jumper.",
        "3": "For LeBron, did you feel George overcommit there on the final play?Ã‚Â  Or Battier hit you in stride with the pass?",
        "5": "LeBron, it seemed like your offense came in flurries in this game, and then you look at the final stat line and it's still 30â€‘10â€‘10Â  Was there anything their defense was doing that you noticed there was opportunities at certain times?Ã‚Â  Or was it flowâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘game type of situation?",
        "6": "In a bestâ€‘ofâ€‘seven series with an emotional win like this, does it count a little more?",
        "8": "LeBron, can you talk about your nonchalant demeanorÂ  After you hit the shot, you almost felt like I'm supposed to do that.",
        "10": "LeBron, on your 30â€‘10â€‘10 tonight, Spo talked about how you might need to continue at that level for you guys to win this seriesÂ  Talk about it just from the emphasis of reboundingÂ  You raised your rebounding against this team last yearÂ  How important is that?",
        "11": "LeBron, on the last two possessions, when you scored with layâ€‘ups, Hibbert was not on the floorÂ  Vogel said when he came in, maybe next time I'll put him out thereÂ  Paul George said, I'm 100% sure that he would have been there at the rim if he was out thereÂ  How do you think it might have been different if he was out there?",
        "12": "LeBron on the last play, if you said Chris was an option and Ray was an option, how soon after the inbounds pass did you realize they were no longer options for you?",
        "14": "LeBron, it was like five hours ago by now, but the play with your elbow, any problems with that?Ã‚Â  And also did you get any feel for whether there's concern about Mario's status going into Friday?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, our play didn't change at allÂ  We went into the timeout, we had two different calls, and me and Spo looked at each other, and he asked me which one I felt comfortable doingÂ  I had enough time where I could get to the basket and make a play. I don't know if I was surprised or notÂ  I really wasn't worried if Hibbert was in the game at all or if he was inÂ  I was worried about trying to get a bucket for our team.",
        "1": "I knew I had enough time to get to the rimÂ  Twoâ€‘plus seconds is plenty of timeÂ  I only need one dribble to get to the rimÂ  And the set that we ran, the space that I had, you know, CB first having the first trigger, going to the rim for a lob, and Ray slipping to the corner, a thread and then I was able to be the option at that point and get to the rim.",
        "3": "Shane definitely gave me a great passÂ  All I had to do was just, you knowâ€‘â€‘ I peeked over my left shoulderÂ  I seen Paul George was a little out of placeÂ  So I just took offÂ  I knew I had enough time to do eitherâ€‘â€‘ I could either get to the rim or I could get one dribble in and get up a jumper or a shot. So I seen him leaning a little bitÂ  Just a quick secondÂ  I just took off.",
        "5": "Yeah, for me it's just flow of the gameÂ  I take what the defense gives meÂ  I was able to turn the corner a few times and either get a look up at the shot or at the rim or find my bigs cutting and finishing some playsÂ  The contribution that we got from Bird tonight was unbelievableÂ  Without his effort we don't win this gameÂ  Just his energy and his effort once again. For me it's just the flow of the gameÂ  I don't really predetermine what I'm going to doÂ  I just read and reactÂ  The best thing about it, the coaching staff and my teammates put me in position to be successful, and I try to take advantage of it.",
        "6": "We wish we could take two wins, but we only get oneÂ  That's what it's all aboutÂ  No matter if you win by one or if you win by 30 or whatever the case may beÂ  You just want to winÂ  We have to be better Friday if we want to win againÂ  We'll come here to prepare tomorrow and see the ways that we can do that.",
        "8": "Well, I mean, like I said, my teammates put me in a positionÂ  Coach Spo drove a good play to put me in position to be successfulÂ  It's my job to go out there and make it happenÂ  I mean, I made a layâ€‘upÂ  It's not like I made something halfâ€‘courtÂ  I made a layâ€‘upÂ  I've been doing that since I was eight years old. I understand the circumstances a little bitÂ  It happened to have been in the Eastern Conference FinalsÂ  When you practice something over and over and over, and you justâ€‘â€‘ it's just second nature to you. I also know, hey, we protect home courtÂ  This is Game 1Â  That's what it's about.",
        "10": "It's very importantÂ  When we go against guys that are taller than us, a little bit bigger than us, our front court and our back court have to help out with the reboundingÂ  I got to go out andâ€‘â€‘ if I have to average ten rebounds in this series or whatever the case may be, I have to be out there for my bigsÂ  My bigs are fighting with Hibbert and fighting with David West all game longÂ  When some of those long rebounds come off, myself and Dâ€‘Wade and Norris have to be able to clean the glass to help our bigs out. So just trying to contribute the best way I can when I'm out on the floor.",
        "11": "I mean, I don't knowÂ  We don'tâ€‘â€‘ any of us know that?Ã‚Â  Dâ€‘Wade was not there either, because he fouled outÂ  I mean, you can't say what would have been differentÂ  Ten guys out on the floor, and I was able to get the lane against George Hill in the first one, and I was able to get the lane on Paul George in the second one. You know, I was on attackwhen Hibbert was in the game, I was on attack when Hibbert wasn't in the gameÂ  That's not for us to worry about.",
        "12": "Once I got the ball I was the only optionÂ  I was the only option at that pointÂ  Especially with only being 2â€‘plus secondsÂ  As unselfish as a player I am, I cannot no way try to make a pass at that point. Like I said, I'm blessed to be in that positionÂ  My teammates put me in a great position each and every nightÂ  My coaching staffÂ  And I just try to come through for them.",
        "14": "I mean, after it happened, I landed on the elbow, and it would have happened when I decided not to wear my elbow sleeveÂ  I shot the two free throwsÂ  My fingers were still tingling a little bitÂ  But it kind of wore off. There's concern for our starting point guardÂ  Any time one of our players go down, especially in the postseason, where every game and every possession counts and we need everyone out there, there's a little concernÂ  But I think our training staff is amazingÂ  Rio is a tough guyÂ  So we'll see what happensÂ  Hopefully he's available by FridayÂ  He should beÂ  We don't knowÂ  If not Norris will step up, and I know Mike Miller is looking for the opportunity to probably be back on the floorÂ  You know, call in the righty.

        "0": "After everything, you've had about an hour to soak it inÂ  I know that isn't a whole lot of time, but after all the times you've thought about what this moment feels like, was it better, was it what you envisioned?",
        "1": "You've spoken so much about growing as a player and growing as a person over the last yearÂ  Do you think where you are in your life now makes it even that much more special, and is there a pride that it wasn't just growth as a basketball player, but that you're in a better place as a person to really enjoy it now?",
        "2": "On the podium I thought you said something interesting:Ã‚Â  You said that the worst thing that you heard last year was that you're selfish because you've always prided yourself on being a team playerÂ  Could you maybe elaborate on that more, hearing that, and how that fueled you.",
        "3": "In hindsight do you think that your journey to a title eight years later was just the natural growing pains of a player in the league, and maybe we judged you too early and your journey turned out to be almost like Michael's or Isiah's or Dirk Nowitzki's, where they had to wait a while?",
        "4": "At times you make it look very easy on the courtÂ  How hard was this to win a championship?",
        "5": "Right after the final whistle we saw you hugging and talking to Kevin DurantÂ  What were you talking about?Ã‚Â  And do you actually feel like the No.1 player in the world right now?",
        "6": "This question isn't intended to bait you or intended as some negative question, but what would you say to the Cleveland fans tonight that wanted to share this moment with you, wanted to win this championship with you?Ã‚Â  What words would you offer them?",
        "7": "Can you give us your thoughts on the ThunderÂ  And you've been there, do you have any suggestions for KD or any of that group as to what it will take to reach that next step?",
        "8": "I wanted to ask you, your journey has taken you to very highs and very lowsÂ  What have you learned about yourself as a ballplayer and as a man through your journey to the championship?",
        "9": "Does it make it any more special that you were able to do this in such a condensed season, 66 games, regular season games in four months, back to back to backs?Ã‚Â  It must have gotten real tiring for youÂ  Does that make it even more special that it was so frenetic?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's everything and moreÂ  You know, I dreamed about this opportunity and this moment for a long time, including last night, including todayÂ  You know, my dream has become a reality now, and it's the best feeling I ever had.",
        "1": "Absolutely, you said it perfectÂ  The fact that I have a family, a fiancÃƒÂ©e, two kids, supporting cast, supporting family, allows meâ€‘â€‘ it took me to go all the way to the top and then hit rock bottom basically to realize what I needed to do as a professional athlete and as a personÂ  You know, I'm just happy that I was able to be put back in this positionÂ  I trusted my instincts, I trusted my habits that I built over the years, and I just got back to just being myself, and I didn't care too much about what anyone said about meÂ  I just kind of made my own path, but did it the right way, and I'm happy I was able to do it the right way and do it for myself and not for anyone else.",
        "2": "I mean, I heard it a lotÂ  Last year I let it affect meÂ  I told you guys over and over and over, I was playing to prove people wrong last year, and people would say I was selfish, and that got to meÂ  That got to me a lot because I know that this is a team gameÂ  I know the coaches that I had when I was younger always preached about teamÂ  There's no \"I\" in team, and to win a championship, no matter on which level, you have to do it as a teamÂ  A lot of people were saying I was a selfish person and a selfish player, it got to meÂ  All last year I tried to prove people wrong, prove you guys wrong, and it wasn't meÂ  At the end of the day, I was basically fighting against myself. The best thing that happened to me last year was us losing The Finals, you know, and me playing the way I played, it was the best thing to ever happen to me in my career because basically I got back to the basicsÂ  It humbled meÂ  I knew what it was going to have to take, and I was going to have to change as a basketball player, and I was going to have to change as a person to get what I wanted. You know, it happened just one year later.",
        "3": "It was a journey for myselfÂ  I don't want to compare it to any other player, but it was definitely a journeyÂ  Everything that went along with me being a high school prodigy when I was 16 and on the cover of Sports Illustrated, to being drafted and having to be the face of a franchise, everything that came with it, I had to deal with and I had to learn through itÂ  No one had went through that journey, so I had to learn on my ownÂ  All the ups and downs, everything that came along with it, I had to basically figure it out on my own. You know, I'm happy now that eight years later, nine years later since I've been drafted that I can finally say that I'm a champion, and I did it the right wayÂ  I didn't shortcut anythingÂ  You know, I put a lot of hard work and dedication in it, and hard work pays offÂ  It's a great moment for myself.",
        "4": "It was the hardest thing I've ever done as a basketball player, since I picked up a basketball when I was nine years oldÂ  It's the hardest thing I ever doneÂ  It's not easy at allÂ  You just put a lot of hard work into it, and hopefully one day you hope that it pays off for youÂ  You know, this was a testament to thatÂ  I gave it my all, and it paid off for me tonight.",
        "5": "I think Kevin Durant is a hell of a player, one of the best players that we have in this league, hands downÂ  I basically told him I was proud of him, everything he achieved this yearÂ  You know, he's going to use this experience, like I used it, as motivationÂ  Hopefully I don't continue to have to run into him because he's that greatÂ  He's one of the best, on and off the court. In the summertime we worked out togetherÂ  I envisioned it, but I didn't know it was going to happen, but to see a few months later that we was going to meet each other in The Finals, it was a great moment for myself and for him. But as far as your second question, I don't knowÂ  That's for you guys to write, to say if I'm the best player in the league or the No.1 player in the leagueÂ  All I know is I'm a champion, and that's all that matters.",
        "6": "I mean, right here I'm sitting here as a member of the Miami HeatÂ  The hard work and dedication that we put in these last two years to get to this point, I mean, it was unbelievableÂ  I wanted to become a champion somedayÂ  I didn't know exactly when it would happen, but I put in a lot of hard work. For me, I'm happyÂ  I'm very excitedÂ  I'm very happy right now to be a championÂ  Nobody can take that away from me.",
        "7": "Well, first of all, I think it's a great teamÂ  Like I said before, we're the two best teams in The FinalsÂ  They create some unbelievable matchup problems with their attack, Russ and KD and James, and they have Ibaka the shotblocker, the phenomenal presence of Perkins and the list goes onÂ  Collison is a bigâ€‘time player, as well. So they're going to be a team to be reckoned with for a lot of years because they're young, and they're going to use this experience as motivationÂ  You know, this is not the last time we'll see the Oklahoma CityÂ  I wouldn't be surprisedâ€‘â€‘ this won't be the last time we see them in The Finals.",
        "8": "The biggest thing I learned is that you can't control what people say about you, what people think about youÂ  You just have to be true to yourself and true to the people that surround you and your loved onesÂ  You know, like I said, I put a lot of hard work into thisÂ  I took one weekâ€‘â€‘ I took, I think, one and a half, maybe two weeks off after we lost the NBA Finals, and I just got in the gym and I got back to the basics. It just shows when you're committed and you give everything to the game, the game pays off and it gives back to you.",
        "9": "I mean, condensed schedule, 66 games, 82 games, shoot, we could have played one regular season gameÂ  Hey, man, I'm NBA champion, and it don't matter. Love you guys. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "Going back even to like the summer, you've talked about different approach, focus, mindset, all of those things, and throughout the postseason you haven't changed the approach one bitÂ  How much more difficult will that be for you the next 36 hours?Ã‚Â  And also, do you have any idea what you're going to say?Ã‚Â  We hear some of the huddles obviouslyÂ  Do you have any idea what you're going to say to guys tomorrow night?",
        "2": "Where did the reading program come from and what has that done for you throughout this Playoffs?",
        "3": "I wonder if you can just indulge a couple of bad Finals memories here for a secondÂ  What do you recall about 2007, and what do you remember about your feelings sitting there on that podium around this time last year after Game 6?",

        "5": "You talked about the things that you wanted to do better after last year, and one of the things you did was go to HoustonÂ  Have you heard from Hakeem recently about your progress in the post, and when you look back at what you did at that point, do you see it manifesting now?",
        "6": "Erik was saying last night that a lot of things that you guys have done in the last week or two are not things that he thinks you guys as a team could have done last year, everyone of course armchairâ€‘analyzes you on thatÂ  But I wanted to ask you what you thinkÂ  Do you think that you would have been able to come in, cramping, make that shot, that threeâ€‘pointer and sort of have the mental focus to do that last year?",
        "7": "When have you felt that pressure most through these Playoffs?",
        "8": "You kind of just mentioned it, but you had these two opportunitiesÂ  What does it feel like now in the moment right now to be one game away?Ã‚Â  And what do you think of the challenge of getting it done?",
        "9": "You said you're not really feeling pressure, but do you have to shut anything down as far as phones or friends or family, because while you're trying to stay in the moment other people may not be?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I feel a lot better than I did last nightÂ  That's clearÂ  I'm able to walk up here even better than I did last night when I talked to you guysÂ  I'm still a little more because of the muscles just kind of being at an intense level, very tightÂ  I'm still soreÂ  I was able to get some treatment last nightÂ  I was able to get some treatment this morning. We prepared for Game 5 a little bit todayÂ  We didn't do very much running and things of that nature, but I think I'm going to used today as an opportunity to continue to improve with my legsÂ  And also with the game being basically at midnight tomorrow night, I have all day tomorrow, too, to prepareÂ  I should be fine by tomorrow night.",
        "1": "Well, my approach won't change and it won't be difficultÂ  I have a job to do, and my job is not doneÂ  You know, I've been very focused, and I'm determined for us to play at a high levelÂ  So I will make sure my guys are ready for Game 5, and we will be preparedÂ  Coach Spo and the coaching staff will give us a great game planÂ  And I'll make sure myself and my teammates are ready to execute it. I have no idea what I'll say before we go out thereÂ  It kind of just comes to me when I'm getting ready to go out there and stand on the floorÂ  But hopefully whatever I say will inspire our guys to go out and give a good show.",
        "2": "It just slows my mind downÂ  It just gives me another outletÂ  Throughout the Playoffs, all you think about is basketballÂ  All you want to do is play basketballÂ  But at the same time it can become a lotÂ  It can become to a point where it's overloading to the mind, and you think about it too muchÂ  It's hard to get away from it because you're playing every other day, you talk about it every single day, you prepare every single dayÂ  So being able toâ€‘â€‘ the reading has gave me an opportunity to justfor those couple hours of the day or those 20 minutes, 25 minutes before the game, just gives me an opportunity just to read and think about something else, and get a sense of what else is going on besides the game of basketballÂ  It's made me comfortableÂ  I'm not saying it's the trickÂ  It's just something that I decided to do at the beginning of the postseason, and it's worked for me.",
        "3": "I don't remember too much of 2007Â  I know I was young and inexperiencedÂ  As a team we was inexperienced, and we ran into a San Antonio Spurs team who had already won, I think, three of them to that point, and they had been in that moment, and they showed itÂ  So they kind ofâ€‘â€‘ in Game 3 I think we had an opportunity to win that game, but after that game they kind of put us to bed in Game 4. Last year after Game 6, after losing, once again, I was very frustratedÂ  I was very hurt that I let my teammates down, and I was very immatureÂ  Like I said, last year I played to prove people wrong instead of just playing my game, instead of just going out and having fun and playing a game that I grew up loving and why I fell in love with the gameÂ  So I was very immature last year after Game 6 towards you guys and towards everyone that was watching. One thing that I learned, and someone taught me this, the greatest teacher you can have in life is experienceÂ  I've experienced some things in my long but short career, and I'm able to make it better of myself throughout these Playoffs and throughout this whole year, and that's on and off the court. I'm just happy that I'm able to be in this position today and be back in this stage where I can do the things that I can do to make this team proud, make this organization proud, and we'll see what happens.",
        "4": "NoÂ  At the end of the day, coming into this series, thisâ€‘â€‘ you know, I'm a historian of the game and I love the history of the game, so coming into this series, this reminded me of â€‘â€‘ I wasn't able to watch it live, but I know the history of the game, so it reminded me of the '91 Finals of the Bulls and the LakersÂ  The whole world was so excited to finally see Michael Jordan versus Magic Johnson in The FinalsÂ  They didn't really care about the Lakers and the Bulls going against one another, it was all about Magic and Jordan. That's what it was about coming into this seriesÂ  You know, everyone was excited to finally get an opportunity to see two of the best players go head to head, myself and KD, but for me personally, it's not a headâ€‘toâ€‘head battleÂ  When I go out on the floor, I do want to dominate the guy in front of me, but this is a team game, and I have all the trust in my teammates, and I try to do everything that needs to be done individually to help our team win. I really don't get involved into the headâ€‘toâ€‘head battle as far as outside the lines of the basketball court.",
        "5": "Yeah, I've talked to him three times since the postseason startedÂ  He asked me if I've been watching the filmÂ  He tells me to continue to do what I've been doing and continueâ€‘â€‘ staying in the post will get you easy buckets, and he also tells me to continue to have funÂ  That's the thing he noticed with me this yearÂ  He's seen me have a lot of fun, and I give a lot of thanks to him for allowing me to go down there and work with him for that week, and instill a part of my game that I felt like needed to be worked, and I was happy that I was able to go and join him and get work on it.",
        "6": "I don't know because I wasn't in that position to be cramping, I guess, in Game 4Â  But I didn't make enough plays in Game 4 last year, I'll tell you that. Like I said before the series started and before this postseason started, I wanted to make gameâ€‘changing plays because that's who I am, and that's what separates me from a lot of players, that I try to go out there and make gameâ€‘changing plays every single game, plays that may seem out of reach or may seem out of range, I try to make those playsÂ  I didn't do that last year in The Finals, and that's what stuck with me more than anything. Like I said last night when I talked to you guys, I'm happy that I was able to be in a position last night even with the limited mobility that I had, I was able to be in a position to make a gameâ€‘changing play from that three.",
        "7": "The pressure?Ã‚Â  I haven't really felt it that muchÂ  Last year it was much more than it is todayÂ  I remember being Game 5 last year with the series tied 2â€‘2, it just felt more pressure, felt like it was more people here, felt like you guys not only brought yourselves but brought your relatives all into DallasÂ  It just seemed more. And I may be wrongÂ  I probably am wrong about thatÂ  But I'm just more comfortableÂ  I think just me being more comfortable and me just trying to seize an opportunityÂ  This is my third crack at itÂ  First of all, I'm blessed because a lot of people, first of all, never go to The FinalsÂ  Second of all, if they go, they never go backÂ  And this is my third opportunityÂ  So I'm just trying to make the most of itÂ  And like I said, win, lose or draw, I'm giving my all, and I'm going to be happyÂ  I'll be satisfied with that.",
        "8": "For me I'm notâ€‘â€‘ I haven't even really looked at it as just one game awayÂ  I look at it as this is our next gameÂ  As crazy as it sounds, I haven't got caught up in itÂ  I won't get caught up in it because I'm not going to letâ€‘â€‘ you know, the human nature is to automatically think about after we win it, what are we going to doÂ  I'm not thereÂ  I won't get there until those zeros hit and I see that we wonÂ  I'm the leader of this team, and I'm not comfortable right nowÂ  I'm comfortable in my game, but I'm not going to be comfortable until we seal this thing. Game 5 is a Game 7 for us, you know, and it's a mustâ€‘win for them, but it's a mustâ€‘win for us, too, and as a leader of this team, I'll approach it that way, and hopefully I won't have to be dealing with cramps tomorrow night.",
        "9": "Yeah, they've already beenâ€‘â€‘ since the postseason started everyone has been shut downÂ  They understand what I've been going through over the yearsÂ  My family has just been allowing me to just play the game and not worry about everything else that's going onÂ  They wouldn't dare get in my way at this point.

      "questions": {
        "0": "There were so many moments this year when you were Westbrook having to score close to 40, those kind of games to carry your teamÂ  How good did it feel tonight when you look at the boxscore, see 25 from Dwyane, 25 from Mario, Chris a rebound from a doubleâ€‘double?Ã‚Â  How satisfying is it for you to have a team victory in a game like this?",
        "1": "Two things:Ã‚Â  First, can you sort of update us on how you're feeling, how you're doing right now?",
        "2": "Has it hit you that you're one win away at this point?Ã‚Â  Can you afford to think about it in those terms, or can you not think about it in those terms?",
        "3": "What did it feel like?Ã‚Â  And have you ever experienced anything like that before?",
        "4": "How do you block that pain out, I guess, for that threeâ€‘pointer there with under three minutes to go?",
        "5": "Can you just talk about the resiliency of this teamÂ  You've battled back from playoff deficits, you've not had BoshÂ  Tonight the guys stepped up when you were outÂ  Just talk about that overall, and now you're one game away from a title.",
        "6": "How frustrating, first of all, was it for you to not be out there in the final minute of the game?",
        "7": "I know you're a student of the game, you know the history of this gameÂ  When I saw you come out there, it reminded me of Willis Reed stepping out for the Knicks more than 40 years agoÂ  Did you think you were in the middle of something special hitting that threeâ€‘pointer?",
        "8": "Could you talk about Russell Westbrook's game tonight and what you expect from them when they face being closed out on Thursday.",
        "9": "You're one home W away from a ring. Ã‚Â Do you start thinking about it?Ã‚Â  Do you fathom this already?",
        "10": "You were guarded by Thabo Sefolosha most of the timeÂ  What do you think about this matchup and Sefolosha's defense?",
        "11": "Erik said basically at the end that he decided he couldn't play fourâ€‘onâ€‘five at that stage because you couldn't give much moreÂ  Did you fight him on that?Ã‚Â  And when you had cramps before, what do you do between now and the next game?",
        "12": "You've talked about what you want to do to get back into the game after you got to the bench with your cramps, but what was going through your mind right when you hit the ground and then had to be carried off the court?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's a bigâ€‘time team winÂ  We needed everyone's effort, and everyone came up and made a playÂ  You know, from the starters to Rio's spectacular game, to Norris, as wellÂ  We was down in that first quarter, Norris came in and gave us a spark, hit a couple threes, got into the lane, got a layâ€‘up and made some plays to kind of help us get into a rhythm. You know, it's a bigâ€‘time team win, and we needed every point, we needed every rebound and everything that everyone had to get it.",
        "1": "I'm feeling a lot betterÂ  I'm feeling goodÂ  We'll see how I feel tomorrow, too.",
        "2": "I mean, of course it's there to think about, but I'm not taking our preparation for Game 5 for grantedÂ  We're going to prepare the same way we've been preparing all series, and if we play Miami Heat basketball, we give ourselves a good chance to win.",
        "3": "Yeah, yeah, I haveÂ  What did it feel like?Ã‚Â  I mean, I don't knowÂ  I mean, you have to play sports and get a cramp before to understand the feelingÂ  It's basically like your body just shuts down, your legs shut down on you, there's nothing really you can do about it.",
        "4": "I mean, the ball was swung to me, and the shot clock was going downÂ  I just wanted to step up and try to make a playÂ  You know, and I was able to drain that three and give us a liftÂ  I was just trying to make a playÂ  If I was out on the floor, I wanted to try to make a play with the limited mobility I had at that time, and I was happy I was able to come through.",
        "5": "Well, for us we're a complete teamÂ  A lot of people don't understand that about our team, and they always just focus on myself or Dâ€‘Wade and CBÂ  But everyone's effort, all the hard work everyone puts into it makes us a complete teamÂ  We need that performance from everyoneÂ  You know, we understand it, myself and Dâ€‘Wade and CB get a lot of the press, but without all the sacrifices and all the commitments from the other guys, we wouldn't be in this position.",
        "6": "It was very frustrating because I'm a competitor, and I want to be out there to help my teamÂ  But like I said, it's a team game, and that's why we have those other guys out there that's going to make plays, even if I'm not available or someone else is not availableÂ  That's what it's been for us all season and all PlayoffsÂ  When someone goes down for any reason, guys step up.",
        "7": "I did want to come outÂ  Like I said, I sat on the bench, got rehydrated as much as I could while we had a long timeâ€‘out, and sat through a few plays and I was able to go back into the gameÂ  Like I said, I'm happy I was able to make a play, make a big shot in a big game, and my teammates were able to close it from there.",
        "8": "This is the second time we've seen a performance like that from a great point guardÂ  The first one was Rajon Rondo when he had that spectacular game against usÂ  I think that was Game 2, if I'm not mistaken, of last seriesÂ  I mean, so many great point guards in this league today, Rondo and Westbrook and Derrick Rose and Chris Paul, these guys can do wonderful things, and Westbrook gave it his all, shot the ball extremely well, and he came out from the gate. I think they hit their first three or four shotsÂ  He was in attack mode, and you get a couple layâ€‘ups, his jumper started fallingÂ  He gave them an opportunity to win this gameÂ  And at the same time it just shows that we can still win those gamesÂ  If someone has a spectacular game against us, we're still able to find a way to winÂ  But he had a hell of a gameÂ  He had a bigâ€‘time game.",
        "9": "You know, tomorrow we're going to prepare for Game 5Â  We've got to prepare like we've prepared all series and all seasonÂ  You know, Coach Spo and the coaching staff has given us a great game planÂ  There's some things they can change, that we can correctÂ  Like I said, if we come out with the mindset that we've come out with during the Playoffs, we're going to give ourselves a good chance to winÂ  That's all we can ask for.",
        "10": "I think Sefolosha is a very active defenderÂ  He's wiry, he's strong down in the post at times, but he has quick hands, he has long arms, so you can't play with the ball around himÂ  But I enjoy the matchâ€‘upÂ  I enjoy whoever they put on me, and I just try to thrive and make plays for our team.",
        "11": "No, I didn't fight himÂ  I caught the cramps the one time, and tried to get some liquids in me, get rehydrated and went back in, and it happened again at that pointÂ  I knew I probably wasn't going to be able to finish the game. I didn't fight themÂ  I didn't fight anything at that pointÂ  I just put the faith in my teammates, which I understandÂ  I've got a lot of faith in them, and I love them for the way they played tonight. Between now and Game 5, just try to rehydrateÂ  I lost a lot tonight, but I will be readyÂ  I'll be ready for Game 5, and hopefully I can stay hydrated where it doesn't happen again.",
        "12": "Well, I knew I wasn't injuredÂ  I just knew I had crampsÂ  I've had it beforeÂ  Your muscles basically just lock up on you, so I tried to walk, but they wasn't letting me moveÂ  So our trainer, Jay, and Juwan came out and assisted me to the benchÂ  I wanted to walk to the bench, but my legs wouldn't allow me. But I've been there beforeÂ  I've had cramps before, like I said, and it's not a pleasant feelingÂ  But I'm happy that we've got a great training staff, a great organization, and they helped me get back on my feetÂ  I was able to walk up here and talk to you guys.

      "questions": {
        "0": "If you go back to the Indiana series, you got Danny Granger in foul trouble, you got Paul Pierce in foul trouble and now you're getting Kevin Durant in foul troubleÂ  When you look at it and see the best player on their team guarding you, do you have a special focus of trying to get him in foul trouble?",
        "1": "What was the moment like when Dwyane came up to you and did confirm or tell you that this was your team?Ã‚Â  And how did that help you in your approach on the court?",
        "2": "Did that conversation surprise you or were you expecting it, or did it even need to be said?",
        "3": "No, it was reportedÂ  I don't know the exact conversation.",
        "4": "The three you made late in the third and then the lanes to the rim sort of reopened again in the fourthÂ  Is that coincidence, or did you guys need one to fall to switch things back up?",
        "5": "Dwyane was up here and Erik was up here saying that neither team might get to their best game this series because of the defense and the quality of the oppositionÂ  You guys have won a lot of games ugly this season and ugly in these PlayoffsÂ  Is that something that's to your benefit that you can win a gritty and grimy game if you have to?Ã‚Â  Are you fine with that, if America doesn't see the greatness of the Heat, but if you get four, are you good with that?",
        "6": "Can you talk about Pat Riley's presence on this team, what he means to you as a team and what he means to you individually and the way you go about the game.",
        "7": "What are some of the biggest changes in the relationship between you and Erik Spoelstra from the first month of the first season here to right now?",
        "8": "Bob McAdoo was talking about when he joined the Heat he talked about he had to finally join the Lakers to win a title and what have youÂ  What kind of advice did he help you through that process?Ã‚Â  Obviously you got a lot of people that didn't like the way you came down to Miami and what have you.",
        "9": "Does that show in a way that even back then you had to kind of collect superstars, no matter how you did it, versus a little bit likeâ€‘â€‘",
        "10": "With this lineup you're most often at least the second biggest guy on the floorÂ  Have you had to change your mindset because of that?Ã‚Â  And is that a reason you've had such success in the paint even going back to the Indiana series?",
        "11": "You've kept that now, and is that a reason for the success, for example, last night in the paint especially?",
        "12": "Would you say that being up 2â€‘1 in The Finals last year and then seeing it unravel stuck with you in the weeks and months following?",
        "13": "Fouls and free throws were critical last nightÂ  Coach Spo was talking about avoiding fouls being a keyÂ  Can you address that, and your ability at times to avoid fouls?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, because that can take away from what you're trying to accomplish offensivelyÂ  I'm just being aggressiveÂ  You know, whoever is in front of me, I just try to put pressure on him, no matter if it's KD or Harden or Sefolosha or whoever is guarding meÂ  I try to put pressure on their defense for myself and my teammates.",
        "1": "Well, for me, I just try to be a leader, out on the floor, in the locker room, and do whatever it takes for us to win basketball gamesÂ  You know, at the end of the day, they look at me to make playsÂ  They look at me to lead themÂ  But I'm not the only leader of this team, D Wade is also a leaderÂ  Udonis is also a leaderÂ  Chris is a leaderÂ  Shane is a leaderÂ  Everyone has leader aspects in their gameÂ  But they just look at me, and when they look at me and they need something done and they need a play in a big game, I try to make it happen to the best of my ability.",
        "2": "He told you how that conversation happened?",
        "3": "YeahÂ  That never happenedÂ  (Smiling).",
        "4": "We didn't have many perimeter shots that fell for us last nightÂ  You know, it was a big shotÂ  We rode that wave that we hadÂ  We was down 10, and we was able to go on a huge run, and it capped off with me making that three in the corner putting us up by two, and we was able to take that twoâ€‘point lead going into the fourth. You know, Shane is our key guy right now, our only guy that's making perimeter shots, and even a few shots that we make from the outside, it opens it up for all of us because they have to respect the fact that we can make some shots outside the threeâ€‘point line or from the perimeter, and once that happened, then our attackers, myself, D Wade, CB, Rio at times, can make plays to get into the paint.",
        "5": "I don't give a damn how we get fourÂ  We can win 32â€‘31Â  It doesn't matter to meÂ  We can win any type of gameÂ  We can win a gritty game, a highâ€‘paced game, but we take every game as its ownÂ  We don't go into a game saying this is what type of a game it's going to beÂ  We going into a game saying this is how we're going to playÂ  We're going to be aggressive, we're going to try to control the rebounding, have low turnovers, and we're going to try to get some good shots up, and try to get to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  And at the end of the day, if we play to our identity like Spo always preaches to us, then we'll give ourselves a good chance to win. Yeah, I don't care how we get four.",
        "6": "Well, for us as a team, he means a lotÂ  You know, he put together this team, and we just look at his rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©Â  We look at his experience either as a player, as a coach or as an executiveÂ  He's done some great things. You know, me knowing the history of the game, he's been around great playersÂ  He's been around Hall of Fame players and guys who have won championships, so any insight that he gives you, he's giving it because of experienceÂ  He knows all about itÂ  He's won at the highest level multiple timesÂ  You know, it's great to have him around and just hear those stories about some of the greatest players to ever play this game like Magic and Kareem, WorthyÂ  It's amazing.",
        "7": "It's trustÂ  I didn't know him, he didn't know me our first month togetherÂ  And now we're still growing each and every day, but our trust factor is greatÂ  I mean, he trusts me on the floor to do things, you know, and that's greatÂ  As a player, you feel confident when your coach allows you to make changes on the fly, and I have the utmost respect for him for allowing me to have that responsibility, where if I see something on the floor, I can just go with it, and I know I'm doing it for the best of the team, and he gives me that leewayÂ  So trust is the number one thing.",
        "8": "Well, the biggest thing is he made a sacrifice to join that teamÂ  You look at Doo's rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ© before he joined the Lakers, he was multiple MVP, multiple scoring champion, he could score with the best of themÂ  But I think he knew that if he was going to be joining the Lakers, he wasn't going to be that same playerÂ  So he had to make sacrifices. Now, I'm not saying that's me because I still have to play at a high level and Doo came off the bench for that Laker team, but I think sacrifice is the word I'm trying to sayÂ  He had to make a sacrifice for the better of the team to win a championship. Like I say, you talk about Pat Riley, you talk about Bob McAdoo who's done so many great things in this league, it's always good to have them around and just get that word from them because they experienced itÂ  The best teacher that you can have in life is experience, so it's great to have them.",
        "9": "Listen, I know the history of the gameÂ  You've got to have superstars and stars to win a championshipÂ  You've got to have a great coaching staff and a great organizationÂ  But as many as Jordan won, he had a great supporting cast around himÂ  As many as Bird won, he had a supporting castÂ  As many as Magic won, he had a supporting cast, same with DuncanÂ  I understand that you can't do it by yourselfÂ  You've got to have guys around you, great players around you, then you've got to have role players, you've got to have a great coaching staff and a great organization and put it all together.",
        "10": "Yeah, I had to change my mindsetÂ  I had to change it when Chris got hurt, that was a big part of our team, going out with an injuryÂ  He put a lot of pressure on the rimÂ  And when he got hurt, he got an andâ€‘one dunkÂ  So I understood I had to change my approach both offensively and defensivelyÂ  I had to rebound more, I had to attack more, get into the paint more to make up the difference with Chris being until he got backÂ  I just had to change, and it's kind of stayed that way since he got back.",
        "11": "I don't knowÂ  I try toâ€‘â€‘ I do a little bit of everythingÂ  I was able to have some success in the paint off eitherâ€‘â€‘ in the post game or off cuts or off pickâ€‘andâ€‘rollsÂ  I tried to do a little bit of everythingÂ  Last night they gave me the lane, I was able to get a couple offensive rebounds and get some putâ€‘backsÂ  Then the second half I was able to come off some pickâ€‘andâ€‘rolls and get to the lane and make a few layâ€‘ups.",
        "12": "Yeah, of course it stuck with us, all the way to this dayÂ  But we're a totally different team than we was last year when we was up 2â€‘1Â  We're a totally different teamÂ  We understand what it takes to win, and we've used that motivation, and we will continue to use that motivation. But last year is last year, and we're not going into a Game 4 on someone else's floorÂ  We're going into a Game 4 on our floor with a lot of experience in this type of situationÂ  We'll be readyÂ  We love the challenge.",
        "13": "Well, I'm not much of a fouler, personallyÂ  Our team, coming into the series, knowing Oklahoma City had shotâ€‘â€‘ coming into the series they shot 90 percent from the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  So as many attack guys as they have and as well as they score the ball, you can't allow them to not only make tough shots, then also put them on the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  You can't give up both. So we just try to make them take tough shots without foulingÂ  KD is a great freeâ€‘throw shooter, Westbrook is a great freeâ€‘throw shooter, and Harden knows how to attack guysÂ  We're just trying to do our bestÂ  We're trying to keep our hands away from contact, contest without foulingÂ  And if they're going to make a contested jump shot or a contested layâ€‘up or things of that nature, then so be itÂ  They're going to do that anyways because they're great players. We just try to play with our principles. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "That driving dunk with a little bit less than four minutes to go in the fourth, can you describe what you saw as you were heading to the basket and took the pass from Mario.",
        "1": "You gave Kevin his fifth foul on that one.",
        "2": "How would you describe the way you're playing in the fourth quarter right now the last couple games?",
        "3": "How did you feel when you guys were down by 10 in the third quarter?Ã‚Â  And how would you characterize the comeback?Ã‚Â  Was it just kind of a grind it out, not pretty but get the job done come back?",
        "4": "Was it kind of a grindâ€‘itâ€‘out mentality?",
        "5": "Everyone knows that everyone on the Thunder is like 22, 23, except for DerekÂ  How do you guys guard against the next couple days thinking that you've broken a young team and this might get easier going forward?",
        "6": "Chris was in here earlier sort of talking about what you said about the series last year in Dallas, that this year you're not leaving anything on the table, you're putting it all togetherÂ  At the end of the fourth quarter it was you, it was Chris, it was Dwyane getting it doneÂ  How much is there resolve now that while you have nice supporting players, we have to step up, we have to step forward, us three, we have to get it done?",
        "7": "You talk about wanting to attackÂ  It just seemed around the rim tonight that you were very physical from the very beginning, taking the ball from Perkins in a couple situations, going up with putâ€‘backsÂ  Again, your mentality tonight played into that?",
        "8": "Can you explain how you guys continuously overcome a size disadvantage even as your team rotation kind of seems to get smallerÂ  And also, at this point are you just used to being a big basically for this team?",
        "9": "How did Durant's foul trouble affect the dynamic of the second half?",
        "10": "For you.",
        "11": "How did his foul trouble affect the dynamic of the second half?",
        "12": "For the unprofessional eyes, it seems as if you can score whenever you want, just a matter of a decision of yoursÂ  What do you think about it?",
        "13": "Chris said you guys talked about the pain from last year all the timeÂ  Is that true?Ã‚Â  And if so, how can you avoid it this time?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't remember that playÂ  What happened?Ã‚Â  I'm serious, which one?",
        "1": "Oh, yeah, yeah, on the breakÂ  Just trying to attackÂ  We got a great blockÂ  I think we got a block, and Rio got the ball, and I started to call for it then and there, but I told him to go middle, so I just filled the lane and Rio hit me and I was able to finishÂ  I seen KD going for the charge, so I kind of went away from him a little bit and was able to get the block.",
        "2": "I don't know, just trying to make playsÂ  I told you guys, last year I didn't make enough gameâ€‘changing plays, and that's what I kind of pride myself onÂ  I didn't do that last year in The FinalsÂ  I'm just trying to make gameâ€‘changing plays, and whatever it takes for our team to win, just trying to step up in key moments and be there for my teammates.",
        "3": "Well, how I was feeling down 10, we weren't playing our gameÂ  They made us stagnant and they came out in the third quarter and attacked us, and we didn't attack backÂ  We did that the last minutes of the third quarter and we was able to cut the lead, I think even taking the lead with D Wade's free throw. We didn't play good to start the third, and we can't do thatÂ  We can't do that against an explosive team like thatÂ  But it just shows our character, how we was able to come back from that and make plays and regain the lead.",
        "4": "Well, that's our mindset, periodÂ  That's just how we playÂ  We always feel like we want to grind out gamesÂ  No matter how well we may be shooting the ball from the outside, no matter how many layâ€‘ups or dunks or fastâ€‘break points we get, we always feel it's going to be a grindâ€‘out game especially since we're playing against a great opponentÂ  So it was that.",
        "5": "It's notÂ  We don't have that mindsetÂ  Our mindset right now is coming into tomorrow we try to get betterÂ  We have to get better in Game 4 because everyone makes an adjustments, everyone comes out the next game and does a better job. In the fourth quarter we had an opportunity to extend the lead, and we turned the ball overÂ  We turned the ball over nine times in the fourth, I believe, and that's not winning basketball. We know they're not brokenÂ  For us, we just want to improveÂ  We want to improve each and every game, and we look forward to the challenge of Game 4.",
        "6": "Well, we've got to make big playsÂ  You know, we understand our supporting cast is going to be there for us no matter what's going on throughout the gameÂ  But if the game gets tight, one of the three of us, or all three of us, have to make plays to bring home the win. You know, it was great to see us able to close this game out tonightÂ  We had a comfortable lead, but they made a runÂ  They made a quick run, cut the lead to one, and then I was able to hit Chris for a layâ€‘upÂ  He got fouled, made two free throws, was able to get a stop, and that's what it's aboutÂ  It's about us just trying to step up when our teammates need us the most.",
        "7": "Well, we felt like they were going to come out aggressive, so I wanted to counter their aggression with aggressionÂ  Put pressure on the rim offensively or get offensive rebounds, I was able to get five offensive rebounds to give us extra possessions and get some secondâ€‘chance pointsÂ  Looking at the stat sheet, we had 46 points in the paint, 11 secondâ€‘chance pointsÂ  So that's goodÂ  And also we had 35 free throwsÂ  That's a really good number for usÂ  When we're getting to the freeâ€‘throw line, even when we don't shoot the ball well, that's a plus for usÂ  Just always trying to be in aggressive mode and do whatever it takes to help our team come out with a win.",
        "8": "I mean, size doesn't matterÂ  It's about just will and determinationÂ  It doesn't matter if someone is taller than you or bigger than you or weighs more than youÂ  You just try to put yourself in a position to get rebounds or make plays to help your teamÂ  That's what it comes down toÂ  We don't care about teams being taller than us or I guess, quoteâ€‘unquote, bigger than usÂ  Every last one of our guys plays bigger than what their height is, bigger than what their weight isÂ  As a team we don't feel like it's a disadvantage whoever we're going against.",
        "9": "Is that a question for me or for them?",
        "10": "It doesn't change me.",
        "11": "I mean, I don't knowÂ  I mean, if he's on the court or he's off the court, we have to still be aggressiveÂ  We have to continue to do our play, play our gameÂ  I think he got it going in the thirdÂ  He made some big shots in the third quarter, gave them the leadÂ  His fourth foul on D Wade, we kind of got the momentum from thereÂ  But he's a great playerÂ  He's going to make shotsÂ  But for us, we have to be aggressive no matter if he's on the floor or not.",
        "12": "I wish it was that easyÂ  You know, that's a great team we're going against, and defensively they have some very active players, so they kind of bring the doubleâ€‘team sometimes when I'm in the post or if I'm in the perimeter they kind of put two on the ballÂ  I just try to take what the defense gives me, try to get into the paintÂ  If I can't do it with the ball, just try to be active on the weak side or cutting or getting offensive rebounds or getting putâ€‘backs that way, just try to do a little bit of everything where I'm not just isolating on the post or on the elbow. You know, it's a good mixture of what I have right now, and my teammates do a good job of finding me when I don't have the ball.",
        "13": "Well, it's absolutely trueÂ  We talk about it all the timeÂ  We understand that it's been a great teacher for us, just the experienceÂ  We don't take things for grantedÂ  We understand that we accept each challenge as its own, and we know Game 4 is going to be a different gameÂ  No matter what happened in Game 1, Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 is its own, and we will approach it like thatÂ  We understand that there's going to be a team that's going to come in and try to get the homeâ€‘court advantage back once again, try to win on our floorÂ  But if we do what we need to do defensively, we make them make tough shots, we rebound, and we don't turn the ball over, we give ourselves a good chance to win Game 4Â  Looking forward to it.

      "questions": {
        "0": "You've got two guys on the team in Shane Battier and Mario Chalmers who have won college national titles and have a chance to add an NBA ringÂ  How cool would it be for those two guys to win a college and NBA ring?Ã‚Â  And do you think it also helps, you've got UD and Dwyane who are champions in the NBA, but having two guys who have won championships in college on the team?",
        "1": "You guys, especially in the two years you've been here, have really tried to build a homeâ€‘court advantage, make this a special placeÂ  How has that come around?Ã‚Â  Do you feel that the homeâ€‘court advantage you have here was similar to what you had in Cleveland?Ã‚Â  And based on what the Thunder have at home, how important is it you feel something similar to what their crowd gave them in the first two games?",
        "2": "There's been this theory about great scorers forever that, okay, you just concede a certain amount of points to them and worry about everybody elseÂ  I'm sure that's probably been used against you a lotÂ  Is KD kind of at that point now where you just know he's going to get 30, and it's more about making sure that guys like Russ and everybody else just don't go off because you know Kevin is going to do what he does?",
        "3": "There was a lot of buildup around this series, when are you able to enjoy it?Ã‚Â  Are you able to enjoy it, or is it just too intense to enjoy with the competition?",
        "4": "When you watch video, are you able to enjoy it as a basketball fan, or not?",
        "5": "Why does it seem like we've only seen your team at its best when behind, like Game 4 against the Pacers, Game 6 begins the Celtics, Game 2 in this series?",
        "6": "What is the difference in your game now when a year ago?Ã‚Â  Is it just a matter of being through this with this team one time and feeling more comfortable, or how much has that really helped you?",
        "7": "Sort of along the same line, so much of I'm sure how you play is between your earsÂ  Are you more ready this year?Ã‚Â  You seem more readyÂ  Are you more ready to meet the moment maybe this year?",
        "8": "Can you talk about the evolution of Erik Spoelstra, how he has adapted over the last two years, and just his coaching style and the way he responds to you guys?",
        "9": "Just to follow up, do you have a specific example of either an interaction that was very meaningful or an example of when he might have listened to you that was effective?",
        "10": "Erik Spoelstra talked of motivating and motivationÂ  Is there any speech he can give, any sentence he can utter, any bulletin board material that would motivate you any more than you're motivated right now?",
        "11": "All five guys on the floor are important on defense, but for you guys how much is team defense a big part of the concept that you throw out there?",
        "12": "What part of your game, if any, do you think needs improvement in this series?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, it would be cool, honestlyÂ  Everyone likes to build and put championships into their rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©Â  It would be unique, and it would be cool at the same time for them.",
        "1": "Well, you always want to try to be dominant at home and protect homeÂ  My days in Cleveland we was very dominant at home in the postseason and in the regular seasonÂ  You want to try to establish thatÂ  When people come into the building they feel like they're at a disadvantage already before the game startsÂ  And our fans here are great, have been great throughout the whole postseason in the last two years, and in Game 7 of the Boston series that just ended, it was the loudest they've beenÂ  They was very excited about us winning that game and moving onto the FinalsÂ  So we look forward to seeing them tomorrowÂ  And they're going to bring that excitement that they've brought. OKC definitely has a unique fanbase and a great fanbase in OKCÂ  It has that college sound, that college feel, and I've never played in a hostile college environment, but I've been to a few games and I know the type of excitement that goes around itÂ  They have something great that's there, and we do, as well.",
        "2": "Well, I mean, like you say, you can't stop KD, you just don't try to give him easy onesÂ  You don't want to give him an easy dunk in transition where you didn't get back on defense, or you give him a transition D because you didn't communicate and gave up and things like that of course, but he's going to make shotsÂ  He can make any shot the game has to offer, off the dribble, off the catchâ€‘andâ€‘shoot, off pindowns, he can make every shotÂ  You just try to wear on him, but he's going to make his shots and get his points because of the type of player he is. And then you've got to control everybody elseÂ  Russell is going to get his points, as well, because he's that good of a playerÂ  He's that talented, as wellÂ  You just try to make them score, but not score because you had a breakdown or messed up on somethingÂ  If they score over the top or in front of you, then you can live with it.",
        "3": "Well, when I'm out on the floor I'm enjoying itÂ  I'm having fun with these first two gamesÂ  I mean, this is a great opportunity for myself and for our team, for both teamsÂ  It's a lot of fun being out there and competing at a high level, you know, the intense moment where every possession countsÂ  That's what it's all aboutÂ  As a competitor you have to enjoy these moments and you love these moments.",
        "4": "Well, I think from a fan's perspective, I think it's beenâ€‘â€‘ the first two games have been greatÂ  You know, I've seen some of the ratings, so that shows the excitement around the game of basketball, shows the excitement around the two teams, and what these two teams have to offerÂ  You have some great story lines and some individual playsÂ  I think it's been great.",
        "5": "I don't knowÂ  I guess when we're behind and when we're down, that's the best time people like to see us atÂ  People like to see us when we're behind and see how we're going to react or make adjustments going into the next gameÂ  I mean, we've played good ball even when we were up, even in the New York seriesÂ  We played good ball, we lost Game 4, but we was able to win Game 5. I don't knowÂ  We don't want to be behind (laughing), we're not trying to get down in the series, we can tell you thatÂ  But it's good to see that we can come back after a little adversity, a little down.",
        "6": "Me personally?Ã‚Â  I'm just more comfortableÂ  I mean, I spent seven years basically â€‘â€‘ the last five years in one systemÂ  I know the ins and outs about that whole system when I was in Cleveland, so I was very comfortable with that situation. A lot of things had to change in my one year here, and I never got fully adjusted throughout the whole year. This year I've just been more comfortable with the team, more comfortable with the system, more comfortable with the city and everything around itÂ  Once I get on the floor, I just let my game kind of react for me and everything I've built throughout the years, just go out and do it, and I don't have to worry about anything else.",
        "7": "Like I said, I'm going to go out and make plays for my team throughout the gameÂ  I'm going to leave it out on the line, and at the end of the day, I'm going to be happy with that. We want to win it, I want to win it, but I only can control what I can control, you know, and that's going out and being there for my teammates throughout the gameÂ  That's all I care about.",
        "8": "I think Spo has been greatÂ  I mean, he's been challenged the last two years by a lot of people, but I think he's been awesomeÂ  Two straight Finals appearances, and he's put us in position to win each and every gameÂ  You know, and for me, our relationship has grown over the last three years because we've been around each other, we understand what we like, our dislikes, everything of that nature, but he's been greatÂ  He's going to continue to grow, and I hope I can continue to grow around himÂ  But he's been greatÂ  He's been a great coach.",
        "9": "No, I just think he's been more open this year, you know, allowing some of the players to voice their opinion on certain situations, either at practice or in a game, no matter what the magnitude of the game isÂ  We trust him and he trusts usÂ  At the end of the day, he has the last call because he is the head coach, but as a player you love that fact when a coach wants to hear or wants to feel what you may see out on the floor during the game or during the film sessionÂ  He's been awesome.",
        "10": "Yeah, absolutelyÂ  He does a great job of doing that each and every day, keeping us motivated, keeping us ready for the taking, ready for the next game or just ready for the momentÂ  You know, every day, every game he comes in with something, and he gets us prepared, both by Xs and Os on the basketball court and also by other things to prepare us for the game.",
        "11": "Well, team defense is everythingÂ  We understand as an individual you want to take the individual challenge, but you also have to have that team defense and that team concept behind you or in front of you or on the side of youÂ  You know, because it helps you out individually when you know you have help, if you get beat, which everyone does in this game, or something happens where there's a breakdown, you know that someone behind you is going to protect youÂ  That's always key.",

        "0": "LeBron, could you just talk about, again, the start your team got off to, 18â€‘2, and how important that was?",
        "1": "Can you talk about your teammate Shane Battier and the series that he's putting together?Ã‚Â  He's had two great games and just talk about what Battier is doing.",
        "2": "After winning Game 2, what do you guys feel is most important going into Game 3?",
        "3": "LeBron, just the fact of can you address how important this game was, especially when it started slipping away, knowing you have a chance to go home 1â€‘1, regain home court in the moment there, how much did that mean to a potential championship run to hold on somehow?",
        "4": "What did you want to do early on inside the paint?",
        "5": "Erik said that the decision for you to guard Durant with about seven minutes left was mutualÂ  How did that come about in the huddle, and can you go through what happened on the final play with you guarding Durant?",
        "6": "You were on the other side of the twoâ€‘threeâ€‘two format last yearÂ  What do you think of the format and do you think it gives an advantage to either side?",
        "7": "Would you have been surprised to have heard a whistle on that last play?Ã‚Â  Would you have been angry?",
        "8": "What has Shane Battier meant to you this season in terms of pregame preparation before every game and then guarding guys that youâ€‘â€‘ relieving defensively, allowing you to get some rest?",
        "9": "When so much is made of you and your team's fourth quarter meltdowns and you hit 12 of 12 free throws, including four in the fourth quarter, is that a milestone, or is that just a game in which you've got a little confidence?",
        "10": "But that's not like a larger statement about you guys in the fourth quarter, that's just one game?",
        "11": "Talk about the pressure after losing Game 1Â  How did you feed off of that and utilize that as a motivating catalyst to come back and get this big win?",
        "12": "As you were going to the basket and being so aggressive early, are you in that mindset thinking that there's nobody on this floor that can guard me?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It was very importantÂ  Any time you get a lead in this series, it's important, no matter if it's a double digit lead or oneâ€‘point lead, because both teams are playing great basketballÂ  Any time you can get a quick start and get a lead, it helps.",
        "1": "He's been a huge liftÂ  He's been a huge lift for usÂ  He's shooting the ball extremely well from the outsideÂ  He's making plays both offensively and defensivelyÂ  We're going to need itÂ  We're going to need itÂ  The series is going to be so tight that we're going to need guys to step up, and Shane has been there in the first two games.",
        "2": "We've just got to continue to do what our staples are, try to get back in transition, level them off, make them take contested shotsÂ  They're very good when you miss a shot or you turn the ball over at getting out and getting early bucketsÂ  We've got to continue to be conscious about our turnovers, and then when we miss a shot we've got to have three guys back just to try to level them off and not allow them to get those transition buckets.",
        "3": "It meant everythingÂ  We had played too well in the first 36 minutes to try to let this one slip away from usÂ  We knew we were going to keep comingÂ  We knew they were going to keep fightingÂ  They've been doing it the whole postseason against all the teams they've played against, especially on their home floorÂ  We just wanted to make one more or two more plays than they made and come out with a victory, and we was able to do that.",
        "4": "For me it's all about aggressionÂ  You know, I just try to get into the paint, make things happen, create for myself, create for others and put some pressure on their defenseÂ  For me that's what my game is all built around.",
        "5": "Well, I mean, for me, I want to guard the best and the biggest point of the gameÂ  KD is an unbelievable talentÂ  I think we all know that, we all see thatÂ  He can make every shot on the floorÂ  Just try to keep a body on him, take contested shotsÂ  He got away from me a couple times, got a couple threes that I am not too happy aboutÂ  So I'll watch the film and try to figure that outÂ  On the last play they were down two and I figured they were going to go to himÂ  He got a small step on me, I just wanted to try to keep a body on him, make him take a tough shot, and he's made tough shots all year, all series, and just that one he missed it.",
        "6": "I mean, when you get to the championship, teams got to win on each other's floorÂ  The twoâ€‘threeâ€‘two doesn't mean much, I guessÂ  I don't know, you've got toâ€‘â€‘ these are the two best teamsÂ  They're confident no matter what building they're inÂ  We're happy now that it's a 1â€‘1 series and we're going back to Miami and will take control of the home courtÂ  It doesn't mean that the series has changedÂ  Both teams can win on each other's floor, and both teams are confident.",
        "7": "I mean, as a competitor, of course you would have been angryÂ  Like I said, I just tried to keep a body on him and make him take a tough one.",
        "8": "Shane has been hugeÂ  Going against him in my career, I understood how smart he was, I understood how competitive he was, especially on the defensive endÂ  I was very excited when we was able to sign him in the off seasonÂ  He's a big part of why we're here today and competing for a championshipÂ  He's meant a lot for our team, he's meant a lot to me, being able to guard guys as well as the top scorersÂ  He did it against Carmelo Anthony, from Carmelo Anthony to David West to Paul Pierce and Brandon Bass all the way down to Ibaka and Kevin DurantÂ  He can guard multiple positions and allows our team to have so many options defensivelyÂ  He plays a big part in that.",
        "9": "I mean, I'm a confident guyÂ  On a big stage like this in a big game like this, every point counts, every point mattersÂ  So you go to the freeâ€‘throw line, no matter how hostile the environment, and try to knock them downÂ  You live with your routine, things you practice all year, and you live with the resultsÂ  Like I said, I'm happy that I was able to go up there and make a few plays, go up there and make my free throwsÂ  We needed itÂ  We needed every point tonight.",
        "10": "That's justâ€‘â€‘ we want to make enough plays to win basketball games, not to answer any questions about what people have to say about us.",
        "11": "I mean, it's a huge game for usÂ  We understood that we wanted to splitÂ  We had an opportunity in Game 1, but it kind of slipped away from us in the fourth quarter, they took control of the gameÂ  And Game 2, we wanted to come out and get the winÂ  We didn't want to go home being down 0â€‘2 even having three games on our home floorÂ  It was good to see the sense of urgency to start the game, and then late in the game make enough plays to even the series.",
        "12": "You know, for me I always want to be aggressive, and I don't think there was just one guy that can guard meÂ  You know, I'm always looking at the next line of defense and seeing the rotation comingÂ  Sometimes it doesn't work in my favorÂ  I got into the hole one time, Ibaka got me from behind, got a blockÂ  But I don't think it's just one guyÂ  You can't just put one guy on me and allow him to be on an island and defend me oneâ€‘onâ€‘oneÂ  It's about being aggressive and taking what the defense gives meÂ  When I shoot double digit free throws, that means I know personally I'm being aggressive when I'm getting to the rimÂ  At the end of the day, it's helping our team.

      "questions": {
        "0": "When you guys played the Pacers and the Celtics, those teams every game, same starting lineup, same approachÂ  You guys have changed lineups because of Chris's injury but also changed approaches a lotÂ  How difficult has it been going through these rounds with different defensive assignments, different philosophies, different approaches and different lineups?",
        "1": "I talked to some Thunder players and they said one of the most intriguing aspects about this series is so many players are diversified defensively and we saw some of that last nightÂ  Do you envision a lot of weird matchâ€‘ups throughout the whole series?",
        "2": "We were talking with Russell Westbrook earlier and he said he started the trend with the glasses; is that right?",
        "3": "I didn't think soÂ  What's the story behind that?",
        "4": "Who started it?",
        "5": "All four of you guys had on the glasses last nightÂ  Was there something behind that?Ã‚Â  Did you guys get together and say we're all going to wear lensless glasses?",
        "6": "Dwyane said earlier this year that there was a point where he sat down with you and told you he wanted you to be you, be a leader and take overÂ  Do you ever find yourself having to flip it with him and trying to tell him that you need him to be Dwyane and be the guy thatâ€‘â€‘",
        "7": "Does it surprise you the second year in that you guys still find those moments where you're trying to figure out when to defer and when to take over?",
        "8": "From an outsider, it doesn't appear that you play with the joy or the theatrics that you once didÂ  If that's true, is that just a sign of getting older or is it a change of venue?Ã‚Â  What do you think is the answer to that?",
        "9": "When you heard that Shane was starting on Durant, what was your reaction, and then are you going toâ€‘â€‘ do you expect that to change?Ã‚Â  Do you want that to change and have you cover him tomorrow?",
        "10": "You mentioned talking to Dwyane every once in a whileÂ  What have you or what will you say to him in a larger sense before Game 2?",
        "11": "On a separate note, when you feel at ease with your surroundings or where you are, where you're living, anything like that, how does that affect your play on the court?",
        "12": "We saw in the last series with KG that there were very specific times where he would come out of gamesÂ  Even if it wasn't good for Boston at that point, it was good for them when he did go back inÂ  You're a different player, different point in your career, but knowing yourself, what is the rhythm that works best for you in terms of some rest during the course of a game no matter how important, and is there something about even seeking rest that you want to avoid right now?",
        "13": "What is the difference at this point in the year in terms of the timeouts, the longer breaks?Ã‚Â  Does that make up for the time where you're actually sitting out game time?",
        "14": "I know there were tactical reasons for you not to start possessions on Kevin because you can switch onto him when they screen, but you also mentioned recently not having any regrets in the last seriesÂ  You don't want to have any regretsÂ  Could you go through this series with no regrets if the buck doesn't stop with you defensively on KD?",
        "15": "You've talked about during the Indiana series getting Dwyane some maybe easy looks earlier in the game, kind of got him going, got him into a flow, more so than maybe saying something off the court, is that what's necessary sometimes to help him break through?",
        "16": "Touching on that, are you a better halfâ€‘court team when you and him are playing that twoâ€‘man game and you're getting him going?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's not been too difficultÂ  It's just been challengingÂ  When you go out there with different lineups from game to game, it's challenging for sureÂ  But we've been able to figure it outÂ  We've been able to figure it out on the fly and find ways to make it successful either for that game or that series in general.",
        "1": "Yeah, I think soÂ  Just because of the depth of teams and both teams have so many guys that can do so many things defensively, that can guard multiple positions defensivelyÂ  You know, it allows both coaches to be flexibleÂ  You can see that throughout the course of the series.",
        "2": "No, that's not right.",
        "3": "There's no stories behind itÂ  You know, it's a look, it's a fashion thingÂ  But he absolutely didn't start it.",
        "4": "I don't know who started it, honestlyÂ  I think know I've wearing mine for about two years nowÂ  But I don't know who started itÂ  None of us started itÂ  It could have started back in the '70s or '80sÂ  I'm seriousÂ  I mean, fashion comes and goes, decadesâ€‘â€‘",
        "5": "No, we didn'tÂ  It just happened like that.",
        "6": "Absolutely, I tell him a lotÂ  A lot of times I try to let him figure it out on his own, but sometimes I go to him and tell him I need one of those games from him, I need one of those performances from him because he still has itÂ  He knows he still has it, too, but every player needs a little kick every now and then, no matter how time tested they areÂ  Yeah, I try to continue to let him know how important he is to this team, which he should know, but he also needs to be D Wade and not worry about deferring as much.",
        "7": "I'm not surprised because it's nowhere near close to last yearÂ  This year it's happened maybe a handful of times, I can probably count on my hands as many times it happened as much basketball as we playÂ  Last year it happened a lotÂ  It happened every week or every other week where we was trying to figure out ways we can help our team or we can figure out ways we can help one anotherÂ  But it wasn't happened much this year, so it's not surprising when it comes upÂ  It's just reassurance.",
        "8": "I think I have a lot of fun with the gameÂ  You know, I'm back to havingâ€‘â€‘ this year in particular, I have a lot of fun or I've had a lot of fun with the gameÂ  I got back to what drove me to the game and what made me fall in love with the gameÂ  It's been a great ride this whole year, and just doing the things that need to be done to help our ballclub win and for me to have fun on and off the floorÂ  I feel good.",
        "9": "I mean, it's whatever, honestlyÂ  I mean, I will do whatever it takes for our team to winÂ  If I need to start on him, I willÂ  I kind ofâ€‘â€‘ coach gave us an idea for Game 1, and we went with itÂ  We still had an opportunity to win Game 1, we just didn't make enough plays.",
        "10": "Oh, I don't knowÂ  Like I said, I don't say something to him before every gameÂ  I don't know even if I will for Game 2Â  We'll seeÂ  I don't have nothing planned as of right now what I may say to him to prepare himÂ  I mean, he's a winner, he's a veteran, he knows how to prepare, so forth, for a Finals game, this being his thirdÂ  We'll see.",
        "11": "I mean, when you're at ease, honestly, the game becomes very easy for youÂ  For me it's just once I was comfortable with everything that was going on off the court, I was able just to let my preparation and all the years that I've put into playing the game of basketball just take care of itselfÂ  I know how much work I've put into the game, and I don't disâ€‘appreciate the game in no way, I don't take it for granted me being in the position I'm inÂ  I kind of let it take care of itself, and it rewards me.",
        "12": "Well, it's a fine line, honestly, especially now being in The FinalsÂ  There's always times where you would like to get a minute here, a minute there, two minutes there, and I've got to be more out with my coaching staff, as well, when I feel like I may need a minute here or a minute there and then I can go back into the gameÂ  But there's also times where I may feel tired, but I'm playing well, we're playing well, so I don't want to mess up the rhythm, and this is a rhythm gameÂ  It's a fine line with getting rest and just playing through it because I don't feel like I hurt my teammates when I am out thereÂ  But it's just all about a communication thing, getting twoâ€‘minutes rest here, threeâ€‘minutes thereÂ  It may can help.",
        "13": "Well, I mean, any time the timeouts or the TV timeouts, the breaks, halftime, you get rest, you're able to recoup and reenergizeÂ  I mean, it helps.",
        "14": "Well, this is one gameÂ  We will make adjustmentsÂ  This is going to be a long seriesÂ  I'm not worried about the end of the series right now.",
        "15": "It isÂ  It is necessary for any scorerÂ  I mean, you look at last night, I mean, Kevin Durant had 10 points in transition, Russell Westbrook had 10 points in transitionÂ  Scorers, when you get those easy transition buckets, the jump shot starts to feel more better, the pullâ€‘up jumpers that are contested feel more better, and for D Wade and for myself, we feel the same wayÂ  When you guys see us get out on the break and we got alleyâ€‘oop dunks and layâ€‘ups and things like that, we start to make a lot of playsÂ  I always try to make a conscious effort especially with Dâ€‘Wade to try to get him some easy ones, you know, get him a dunk in transition or get him a layâ€‘up or in half court where he's not facing the doubleâ€‘team, what he's going to be facing for most of the gameÂ  So it helps.",
        "16": "Well, I mean, every game is its ownÂ  Sometimes we're good, we're great when we're playing our twoâ€‘man game, and other times it has our offense stagnant and it's not allowing us to get the ball from one side to the otherÂ  I think we're very good offensively and in the half court when we're attacking, no matter what we're doing, either we're playing twoâ€‘man game or we're moving the ball from one side to the other and we're attacking the rim and getting to the freeâ€‘throw lineÂ  So that's when we're at our best.

      "questions": {
        "1": "LeBron, you came out defensively against Perkins instead of against KDÂ  Was that your choice and would you have liked to spend more time on him at the outset, and do you think that might change next game?",
        "2": "LeBron, you only played six guys really, a good amount of the timeÂ  You played a few more, but it was a short benchÂ  Did that play a part in the game late in terms of getting tired?",
        "3": "What was going on with you guys able to free up Shane Battier with so many open looks?",
        "4": "Erik said that you guys felt even to the middle of the fourth quarter you were in position to make a move, and then they just, quote, went awayÂ  What do you think happened there?",
        "5": "So how do you guys get those shots, make those shots, and be in those position yourself?",
        "8": "You guys gave up 56 points in the paintÂ  How do you plan on stopping that next game?",
        "9": "Talk about going forward after this loss, you've definitely got to make adjustments on defending KD and RussellÂ  Talk about the efforts that's going to take to stop those guysÂ  You did do a good job on Harden because he only had five points.",
        "10": "Kevin had the big fourth quarterÂ  Could you sense he was being aggressive and looking for his shot more?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "No, it wasn't my choice, it was a suggestion that Spoel brought up, and I thought it was good early on for usÂ  It gave us an opportunity to switch a lot of pick and rolls when Perk went down and did a screen for KD and I was able to switch off for himÂ  Whatever the case may be, we had a good game plan to start the game, and the third quarter hurt us.",
        "2": "I don't think soÂ  You know, we know we have to have more production for sureÂ  We're going to have to have more guys in there to give me and D Wade a restÂ  And Shane, Shane played a lot of minutesÂ  But Spoel will figure that outÂ  We'll be more conscious about it, just trying to get a minute or two here or there so we can finish strong, but I don't think it was much of a problem tonight.",
        "3": "I think offensively we just moved the ballÂ  We moved the ball, and Shane was the recipient of thoseâ€‘â€‘ of us moving the ball, especially in the first halfÂ  He knocked down a lot of shots, you know, and he helped us a lot to spread the floorÂ  He's a big part of our unit, and when he knocks down shots, we're a very, very good teamÂ  He was just the recipient of us moving the ball and getting the ball from one side to another, and he was able to get some shots down.",
        "4": "I think they made shots and we missed shotsÂ  The couple offensive rebounds they got, they didn't make many mistakes in the fourth quarterÂ  I don't think we made many mistakes in the fourth quarter, it's just they made more plays, especially offensivelyÂ  They made more shotsÂ  Russell made some bigâ€‘time shots, KD made some bigâ€‘time shots, and Nick Collison got a few offensive rebounds that allowed him to extra possessions when we did a stopÂ  So I think that's what it's about.",
        "5": "You take them with confidence, take more shots with confidence, and at the end of the day you live with itÂ  All your shots are not going to go in, of course not, but you try to put pressure on the defense, and then when you shoot the ball, you shoot it with confidence.",
        "8": "Not give up 56 points in the paintÂ  (Laughter).",
        "9": "Well, first of all, those two guys are all stars for a reasonÂ  You can't stop them, you just try to limit themÂ  And Russ made some big plays late, but I think we can live with him shooting 10 for 24 from the field. I think KD got a couple looks that we don't likeÂ  He had two transition threes that we gave up where he had nobody on him, and he had a couple jumpers that we didn't like, either, with nobody on himÂ  We need to make adjustments with thatÂ  We will make adjustmentsÂ  Like D Wade said, this was the feel out gameÂ  We come out with a lot of energy, try to steal Game 1, and now we get an opportunity to go to the chalkboard, go to the film and have a better game plan in Game 2 since we've already seen them to see to see what they're capable of doing.",
        "10": "He's always aggressiveÂ  Any time he's on the floor, tonight 46 minutes, he's always aggressiveÂ  It doesn't matter what court it is."

        "0": "Your two Finals experiences you've had so far haven't exactly been the best experiences, I would imagineÂ  How is that shaping the way you're coming into this thing?",
        "1": "It's already been said, people are going to keep saying it, the winner of this series gets to be called the best player in the game, whether it's you or KevinÂ  Is that a fair statement, or do you consider yourself maybe you're already the guy?",
        "2": "When we talked about taking that different approach, not trying to prove anyone wrong, trying to play your game, what was your intention going into it?Ã‚Â  But when it turned out to actually do it, has it been harder than you thought, easier than you thought?",
        "3": "Dwyane was saying they're going to need you to play at that level that you've been performing at some of these games you've been producingÂ  How draining was Game 6 and 7 for you, and where is your energy level at now?",
        "4": "You mentioned earlier your first trip to The Finals in 2007, you went against a very experienced team in San AntonioÂ  What's your view on how much experience matters in the NBA Finals having been there before?",
        "5": "From the moment you guys came together, you guys were kind of overwhelming favorites and had the target on you from day oneÂ  You come into this series where the Thunder is favoredÂ  Is that a little weird and is that maybe a little welcome?",
        "6": "Do you walk into this Game 1 with a different sense, a different feeling than you did a year ago in any way?",
        "7": "Beyond the summer workouts and the game at Morgan State with Kevin, where did your relationship begin with him, how did it develop, and where is it right now?",
        "8": "You've had a lot of introspection this yearÂ  You've talked about it, changing thingsÂ  I guess looking back to last season in The Finals, I mean, what exactly happened and how can you avoid similarâ€‘â€‘",
        "9": "Well, obviously the last series you were averaging 33 points a game against Dallas."

      "answers": {
        "0": "I just feel more at ease nowÂ  My third appearance. Last year, so much had gone on with that series and the whole seasonÂ  And like I said, I played too much to prove people wrong last year, instead of just playing my game and doing what needs to be done. And then the first, I was young, inexperiencedÂ  We had an inexperienced team, and the San Antonio team did what they wanted to against us in that first experience. For me, I'm just at ease nowÂ  At the end of the day in this series, I'm going to play my game, try to do whatever it takes on both ends to make plays and help us winÂ  And at the end of the day, whatever the results happen, I'm going to be satisfied with thatÂ  I'm going to be happy with it because I know I'm going to give it my all, and I won't leave nothing behind.",
        "1": "I don't really careÂ  I don't really get involved in the best player in the gameÂ  It doesn't matter to me, reallyÂ  When I go out on the basketball court each and every night, I want to be the best player in the gameÂ  I want to be the best player on that floor, and that's just how I approach the gameÂ  So I don't really care what people say at the end of this series if KD or LeBron is the best player in the leagueÂ  It has to happen at some point anywaysÂ  I won't be the best player in the league, KD will be, and then KD won't be the best player in the league at some pointÂ  It happens all the timeÂ  It doesn't really matter, so I don't care.",
        "2": "A little bit of bothÂ  There's been sacrifices that have been made throughout this whole seasonÂ  I had to get out of a lot of my comfort zone, a lot of things that I was comfortable with I had toâ€‘â€‘ I had to change some things both on and off the floor, but it's always great when you put your mind to something, you strive to do something, and then it rewards youÂ  It's been rewarding to this point, but like I said, I'm happy that I'm able to be back in the position I was a few years ago when I was just playing the game at a high level, having fun, and then whatever the chips laid, I was satisfied with it because I know I gave it my all.",
        "3": "Game 6, I felt greatÂ  I felt greatÂ  Mentally it was drainingÂ  Physically it was draining, as well, but I felt great throughout that whole gameÂ  It's draining when you finally get into the locker room and you justâ€‘â€‘ you guys always see me got my feet in the ice tub and my knees are wrapped. Then after Game 7, it was even more draining, just the emotions around that series, knowing the team we beat, I mean, it's probably one of the best coached teams that you can ever compete againstÂ  Doc Rivers keeps those guys prepared, and they have four future Hall of Famers in Paul, Rondo, KG and RayÂ  It's challenging going against those guysÂ  So it was very draining not only Game 6 and Game 7, but series in general.",
        "4": "I don't knowÂ  I mean, it all dependsÂ  But if you've got a great team and you're coached well, you know you can always succeed, as wellÂ  But I just think for me, in '07, I don't think as a team we had a good enough team to get there, but I don't thinkâ€‘â€‘ I said it in the press conference after we lost The Finals that we'd got beaten by a better teamÂ  They were better than us and they showed usÂ  We beat us four straight games, and they showed us why they were champions even before that Finals. But I don't know how much experience plays into a FinalsÂ  We were two experienced teams last year, and Dallas was victoriousÂ  We'll seeÂ  We'll see what happens.",
        "5": "It's not weird, it's not welcomingÂ  It's a sevenâ€‘game seriesÂ  The two best teams in the league right nowÂ  It doesn't matter who's favored and who's not favoredÂ  Just got to go out there and playÂ  It's a 48â€‘minute game, and whatever team plays harder or is more composed and makes the right plays at the right time in that particular game is going to win.",
        "6": "I have a different feeling as far as comfort, but I still went into Game 1 last year with a lot ofâ€‘â€‘ I mean, I was focused, and we wanted to win that game, and we did win that gameÂ  We played well that gameÂ  But I don't know, we was at home, this one is on the road, so it's going to be more challenging for usÂ  But we look forward to the challenge.",
        "7": "Well, our relationship has been growing since he was in high school, all the way through Texas and all his years in the NBAÂ  For me, I understood what the situation he was getting himself into being drafted as high as he was, and the things that came with being drafted to a team that needed a marquee player or a superstarÂ  You know, from day one I always lent my hand out to guide him if he needed it, to help him, to mentor him if he needed it through anything, and that's on and off the floor, because to that point I seen everything, and I'm still learning but I've seen everything on and off the floor. Our relationship is really goodÂ  Our relationship is going to continue to grow, and I'm happy to be in this position where I can compete against him.",
        "8": "What do you mean what exactly happened?",
        "9": "I didn't play wellÂ  I think I said that 100 times this yearÂ  I didn't play wellÂ  I didn't make enough gameâ€‘changing plays that I know I'm capable of making, and I felt like I let my teammates downÂ  I don't knowÂ  I don't know if that's something I haven't said beforeÂ  Just didn't make enough plays. I'm happy, and I'm humbled that I can actually be back in this position less than 12 months later to do a better job of making more plays, more gameâ€‘changing plays out on the floor on a bigger stageÂ  So we'll see what happens.

        "1": "LeBron, as you guys are going into the fourth quarter, 73â€‘73, 13 days, basically, all comes down to the next 12 minutesÂ  What are you guys saying to each other?Ã‚Â  What's going through your mind?",
        "4": "The followâ€‘up:Ã‚Â  LeBron did you sort of see that and adjust your game to be more aggressive in the first half because of that?",
        "5": "LeBron, how many times this fall when you were working with KD in Akron did you envision this moment?",
        "6": "(No microphone.)",
        "8": "This is for both of you guys:Ã‚Â  Did Chris tell you guys that that threeâ€‘pointer in the corner would be available?Ã‚Â  Because he said he saw it in tape, whatever, especially after the last gameÂ  And what does it say about him that he's able in his third game to come back and perform like that in a Game 7?",
        "9": "In the last five years of playing against the Celtics, what have you learned from playing against Allen and Garnett and Pierce?",
        "10": "LeBron, Doc Rivers calls you the most scrutinized athlete that he can ever think ofÂ  Do you agree with that?Ã‚Â  And how do you kind of continue to overcome that the way you did the last two games as you play in your third Finals?",
        "12": "That it's even up for debate, it's interesting, right?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "What we're saying to each other, it's timeÂ  It's timeÂ  We want to give a lot of credit to the CelticsÂ  They got a hell of a coach in Doc Rivers and great playersÂ  They pushed us as hard as any team has pushed us thus far. But everything we were saying going into the fourth, it's timeÂ  Let's play our fourthâ€‘quarter defense, what we're capable of doingÂ  I'm glad we were able to do that. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  Kind of the same messageÂ  We got to the huddleÂ  It was take a deep breathÂ  Everyone take a deep breathÂ  BreatheÂ  30 seconds before we start talkingÂ  And then let's focus on what we need to doÂ  And what we needed to do, as LeBron just said, is we needed to lock down defensivelyÂ  And we needed to rebound the ball and get out in transition, and not see a set defenseÂ  And we were able to do that to open the game up, get better opportunities to score and attack the rim.",
        "4": "NoÂ  I got to be in attack mode, no matter what's going on throughout the course of the gameÂ  I always know that he's going to figure it outÂ  So it's not to say that I see what's going on with his game, so I have to be more aggressive; I have to stay aggressiveÂ  It's going to help our team a lot. I don't have to worry about himÂ  Last series in the Indiana game where he didn't play well, I didn't even go to him or say anything to him. Ã‚Â I know he's going to figure it outÂ  It's just the player he isÂ  For me I always have to be in attack mode and try to help our team.",
        "5": "I envisioned it every day we worked outÂ  I understood what his passion wasÂ  I understood what his drive wasÂ  We pushed each other every single dayÂ  That fourâ€‘day span, we called it hell week, that we worked out in AkronÂ  He was a little upset about the series in Dallas, where they got eliminated by Dallas, and I was as wellÂ  So we pushed each other each and every day. I envisioned us getting to this pointÂ  Like I said, I was happy for him that he's able to get to the FinalsÂ  I'm looking forward to going against him.",
        "6": "It's only rightÂ  It's only rightÂ  We look forward to the challengeÂ  It's going to be a big test for us.",
        "8": "Chris is big. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  Huge. LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  Game ball automatically goes to himÂ  Without his production tonight, we don't winÂ  Come off the bench, 19â€‘8Â  It's hugeÂ  It's something we haven't hadÂ  We haven't had that type of activity, that firepower off the bench since we got hereÂ  It's uniqueÂ  It's very unique that CB is coming off the bench, but it may be something great for us. As far as the play, the threeâ€‘pointer in the corner, I felt like when I got the drive, that KG may sink in and try to take my drive awayÂ  So when I seen that happen, I just kicked it to him, and he just lined it up and made itÂ  He made three of them tonight, and all of them was big. The game ball definitely goes to himÂ  He was big time.",
        "9": "Competitors. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  They're great. LeBRON JAMES:Ã‚Â  They're greatÂ  You can never relaxÂ  You can never relax at all on the court when you're competing against those guysÂ  You can never feel comfortableÂ  You always feel on edge when you go against themÂ  This is their chemistry that they built over the yearsÂ  It's like no other team that I've ever faced in the postseasonÂ  They're greatÂ  They're great. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  I think one thing we take away from looking at the Boston Celtics is you want to talk about someone throwing dirt on them, they get dirt thrown on them all the time, said 2â€‘0, they can't do it againÂ  They've been saying that three years nowÂ  They continue to come out and prove they're going to be thereÂ  Kevin Garnett is 36 years old, you can't tellÂ  He looked amazingÂ  He had an amazing seriesÂ  All of them guys. So we look at them as a team and say, look what they deal with, look what they go through on a yearly basisÂ  That's something that hopefully one day we strive to beÂ  Because that would mean we're successful and that means we're still together. They are great championsÂ  It was tough to beat them the last two yearsÂ  We thankful we were able to.",
        "10": "As far as the scrutinized, I don't get involved in thatÂ  For me as a competitor and as a player individually, I just try to do whatever it takes to help our team winÂ  I do the things in the offseason to prepare myself to come into the season to be dominant, and I try to lead by example and lead by my voice every night we step on the floorÂ  That's on and off the court. I can't worry about what people say about me, about my game, about who I am as a personÂ  I can't get involved in thatÂ  People can have their own opinions, and rightfully so they can have their own opinionsÂ  For me I just go out and play at a high level, and do whatever it takes for us to winÂ  And I can be happy with that.",
        "12": "No, I don't think it's interestingÂ  I don't think it's interesting at allÂ  We've played some good ballÂ  It doesn't matter who starts or who finishes the gameÂ  James Harden doesn't start, but he's always on the court at the end of the gameÂ  Jason Terry doesn't start, but last year in The Finals he was in the fourth quarter every gameÂ  CB didn't start tonight, but he was in the fourth quarterÂ  It doesn't matter who starts, or finishes the game, it's who is being productiveÂ  That's what it all boils down to.

        "8": "Fantastic gameÂ  Listen, it's obvious you do any and everything to help your team win, but has it ever really been more apparent how central it is for you in particular to really look to shoot the ball, even if it's over two or three defenders?Ã‚Â  Seriously.",
        "9": "LeBron, you said, I won't regret Game 7, and that's been my mindset all seasonÂ  Where did that mindset spawn from?Ã‚Â  I guess to not regret means you had to at one point regret."

        "1": "I don't knowÂ  I don't knowÂ  I haven't reallyâ€‘â€‘ I haven't watched the film or anything like thatÂ  I just tried to make plays for our team throughout the whole game, as long as I was on the court I wanted to make plays, both offensively and defensively, to give ourselves a chance to winÂ  I think I did that tonight.",
        "2": "In an environment like this you want to have a big gameÂ  I wanted to be there for my teammates, no matter what was going on throughout the course of the gameÂ  So like I said, I'm happy I was able to make some plays both offensively and defensively to help us win this game. This was a gutâ€‘check for usÂ  And it's good to see we were able to bounce back after that loss, after that Game 5 loss at home.",
        "3": "You just try to keep the pedal going, keep the pedal down and just continue to be aggressiveÂ  I felt like I was aggressive from the opening tip, and the guys continued to find meÂ  I tried to keep it going. I felt like that a few times in this postseasonÂ  And it's a great feeling to be in when you feel like everything you put up is going inÂ  But you just can'tâ€‘â€‘ you can never let goÂ  You can never let it die down or anything like thatÂ  You know you have to continue to put pressure on their defense, and I was able to do that.",
        "4": "I don't knowÂ  I take every game as its ownÂ  I will continue to be aggressiveÂ  I will try to continue to play at a high level like I done the whole postseasonÂ  If it results in these numbers or whatever the case may be, I'm going to go out there and play my game and play as hard as I canÂ  I don't really care what the stats sayÂ  I won't regret Game 7Â  Win, lose or draw, I'm going to go in with the mindset like I've had this whole seasonÂ  And we'll see what happens.",
        "5": "I wasn't paying too much attention to those guysÂ  I was focused on what we had to do as a team, as an individual, to help us win this ballgameÂ  I was in such a zone I really didn'tâ€‘â€‘ I wasn't trying to pay too close attention to their expressions or what they were going through over thereÂ  I was just doing what I had to do to help our team win this game. I have no idea.",
        "6": "I don't knowÂ  I didn't use any motivationÂ  I just went to my habitsÂ  I went to what I built over the course of the season, over the course of the years, and just went out and playedÂ  I wasn't going to feel sorry for myself or anything tonightÂ  I just go out and play as hard as I can, as I said, and try to make plays for our teamÂ  And at the end of the day, whatever happens happensÂ  I can be satisfied with that. I didn't need no extra motivation tonightÂ  It's the postseasonÂ  I know how big these games areÂ  Every game is bigÂ  So that's my motivation itselfÂ  But I didn't need any extra motivation in this gameÂ  I just went to my habits, what I built ever since I started playing this game.",
        "7": "I don't really get too far in sports talk radio or anything like that too muchÂ  Over the postseason I've been doing a lot of reading and been watching movies and things like thatÂ  I don't really hear the outside noise of what's said about me or what's said about our team. As a team, we never get too high, we never get too lowÂ  So we kind of just try to stay focused on what's at handÂ  And over the course of these 48 hours we've just been worried about Game 6, how can we prepare to win Game 6Â  And our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and as players we tried to go out and execute that.",
        "8": "For me this game is all about teamÂ  I was coached that way as a kid, and it was instilled in me ever since I picked up a basketballÂ  As an individual you can't do it by yourselfÂ  No matter what my numbers was tonight, nowhere near we would have won this game if the other 14 guys weren't in tune and wasn't focused about us trying to win this game. So two guys come to me or three guys come to me, I'm very good at math, that means someone is openÂ  I believe in my teammates, and they're going to knock that shot downÂ  So that's how I play the game, and I will continue to play the game like that, because it's gotten me to this point.",
        "9": "No, it doesn't mean thatÂ  I'm basically saying this whole team is about getting back to the way I play the game of basketballÂ  I said that to all you guys, seen the interview I did with Rachel before the seasonÂ  You guys have all seen itÂ  In a great place right now as far as the game of basketball on the court and off the courtÂ  So I'm looking forward to Game 7Â  See you all in Miami.

        "0": "Are you satisfied with your effort on the loose balls?",
        "1": "LeBron, you're going back to BostonÂ  Two of the previous four years you've been eliminated thereÂ  How do you kind of use the disappointment you've had in the elimination games in Boston to your advantage?Ã‚Â  How do you use that as motivation?",
        "2": "Do you kind of wonder at timesâ€‘â€‘ you look at your numbersâ€‘â€‘ I know people criticize everythingÂ  You look at your numbers, you look at Dwyane's numbers, do you wonder how much more is capable at this point?",
        "3": "When you're facing elimination down 3 whatever in the series, you've always talked about putting the pressure on yourselfÂ  How do you not kind of overwhelm yourself with how much pressureâ€‘â€‘",
        "4": "LeBron, compared to some of the other elimination games in your career, how do you feel?Ã‚Â  The same?Ã‚Â  Or more confident this time?",
        "5": "How do you assess the overall attitude and confidence of the team today in practice compared to last night after the game?",
        "6": "Hearing you stand here, you're feeling calm, saying it is what it is, people who know you would say that the stakes are very important to you, that this matters a lot to you.",
        "7": "How would you describe how big a deal this is to you and what the stakes are?",
        "8": "How much do you put on yourself to pull this out tomorrow night to extend the series?",
        "9": "Is it fitting thatâ€‘â€‘ I mean you're here for a lot of reasonsÂ  Because of BostonÂ  Because of what Dwyane went through, Bosh went through, what you went throughÂ  Is it fitting that an elimination game comes up there?",
        "10": "How do you let that not get in your head?",
        "11": "With the history andâ€‘â€‘",
        "12": "Three losses in a row to the same teamÂ  When you look at those, what do you see is the biggest problem that you guys haven't been able to fix yet or that you need to fix?",
        "13": "You were one of the first to publicly compliment Coach Spoelstra after the Indiana seriesÂ  Today the word \"outâ€‘coached\" is being thrown a lot around by the punditsÂ  Do you want to take an opportunity to publicly defend him now?",
        "14": "When you go back to Boston, do the memories of some of the tough losses linger there?Ã‚Â  Are you able to completely put them out of your mind?",
        "15": "Knowing how physical this thing is going to be tomorrow, how much better equipped are you guys, even if Chris isn't fully right, the fact he's going to be out there?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Some of them we wish we could have come up withÂ  Some of them we haven't been able to come up withÂ  The ball bounces in crazy ways at timesÂ  Sometimes you get them, sometimes you can'tÂ  We feel like we gave ourselves a chance.",
        "1": "I mean, you don't need much motivation right nowÂ  It is what it isÂ  You win and you bring it back here, or you go homeÂ  It's that simpleÂ  I don't need no extra motivation at this pointÂ  I've been motivated since the playoffs started.",
        "2": "I mean, for me, I just got to keep playing my gameÂ  If I can get a couple more points here, a couple more rebounds there, a couple more assists, maybe we win more games. I don't know, manÂ  I put a lot of pressure on myself to try to come through for our teamÂ  Last night I felt like I could have made a couple more plays, and I didn't. But at the end of the day, if you play hard, you go out there and lay it on the line, the numbers will take care of itselfÂ  And you can be happy with it.",
        "3": "I'm notÂ  I won'tÂ  I'm going to go into the game just knowing that I got to try to make plays to help our team win and not put too much pressure on myselfÂ  I understand what I do for our teamÂ  They are goingâ€‘â€‘ I'll be satisfied because they know how hard I playÂ  I'll be fine.",
        "4": "I feel confidentÂ  I feel confident we can go up and get oneÂ  Then we're focusing on Game 6Â  That's what it's all about.",
        "5": "It's definitely differentÂ  Last night we was downÂ  We didn't want to lose that gameÂ  We played hardÂ  Gave ourselves a chance to winÂ  But you have to have a new mindset when you come in here todayÂ  You have to focus on Game 6Â  I know we have to go in with a mindset that we're going to win and bring it home for Game 7Â  We feel confident now.",
        "6": "It does.",
        "7": "It means a lot to meÂ  How much work I've put into this yearÂ  No one said it was going to be easyÂ  I'm looking forward to the challenge, me personallyÂ  I'm looking forward to it more than probably anyone on the teamÂ  So I'm going to lead these guys in the right direction, and hopefully it results in us winning.",
        "8": "I put a lot on myself, like I do any gameÂ  I do a lot for the teamÂ  I hold myself to a high standardÂ  So I want to play wellÂ  I want to play well for sureÂ  I'm not going to put too much pressure saying these are the numbers I'm going to getÂ  I'm going to go out and play my gameÂ  At the end of the day we'll see what happens.",
        "9": "No, it is fittingÂ  I know how much pain this team has given me over the yearsÂ  I think I guess it's only right that we will be going up there in an elimination gameÂ  In order for us to keep our season going, we have to win in their buildingÂ  (Indiscernible).",
        "10": "What do you mean?",
        "11": "Let it not get in my head?Ã‚Â  It's a new dayÂ  It's a new gameÂ  But it's obviously a great team, and if we go in with a game plan and we go in and play hard, all we can ask for is to give ourselves a chance to win late in the gameÂ  We can be satisfied with that.",
        "12": "Game 3 it wasn't closeÂ  They pretty much got whatever they wantedÂ  Game 4 we gave ourselves a chance to winÂ  We didn't make enough playsÂ  It was a great game. And last night we also hadâ€‘â€‘ I mean there were some tough bouncesÂ  I know a few plays went right off the top of my headÂ  Dâ€‘Wade got the block off BassÂ  It was a 50â€‘50 ball in the airÂ  Rondo punched it to Pietrus for a threeÂ  That was a big play. And then another play was Ray Allen went down the lane, kind of kicked it off his foot, picked it up and hit Pietrus again for another threeÂ  Sometimes the ball bounces in different waysÂ  Momentum plays happen. But like I said, last night we gave ourselves a chance to winÂ  That's all you got to do.",
        "13": "I mean, he's our coachÂ  I don't need to defend himÂ  I'm hereÂ  We got a lot of respect for SpoÂ  We have all the confidence he's going to give us a game plan to help us win. Me personally, I don't even hear what goes on out thereÂ  I only hear it until you guys tell me about itÂ  So it's always new to meÂ  I know he's heard it beforeÂ  That's not new to him either.",
        "14": "I mean, they definitely come upÂ  Of courseÂ  It's human for them to come upÂ  You got to approach tomorrow's game like it's its ownÂ  And we look forward to the challengeÂ  I know I do.",
        "15": "We can use hisâ€‘â€‘ we're going to have to have him out there on the courtÂ  I think he played great in his minutes he had last nightÂ  14 minutes, 9â€‘7, that's really good production. The fact that we're a whole finally for a game that means a lot to us all, it should help us. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you've faced height in the first two series, in Chandler and then in HibbertÂ  Is this a different kind of height you're dealing with now with what KG can do and how maybe the Celtics are trying to use him against your smaller roster?",
        "1": "You're a guy who takes pride in guarding one through fiveÂ  Is that a cover you believe with adjustments you could handle if Erik again chooses to go with the smaller lineup?",
        "2": "With Indiana in Game 3, you almost personally tried to get Dwyane going there so that it would turn around for you laterâ€‘â€‘ Game 4, actuallyâ€‘â€‘ later in the seriesÂ  Do you feel like you're in that stage again where you would like to get him what they call the relief baskets, some easier shots?Ã‚Â  And will that be a focusâ€‘â€‘",
        "3": "LeBron, 24 freeâ€‘throws in Game 2, only five last nightÂ  Dwyane had no freeâ€‘throws last nightÂ  How do you explain that?Ã‚Â  Anything change?",
        "4": "Do you suppose that effort was the issueâ€‘â€‘ the effort statsâ€‘â€‘ that they had the advantage?Ã‚Â  Do you think that was a case of a team that was desperate down 2â€‘0?",
        "5": "What do you want to work on the most today?Ã‚Â  What's sort of in your head to work on for Game 4?",
        "6": "When you guys are up 2â€‘0 and you lose a game, the fans think the sky is fallingÂ  Is it different for the players?",
        "7": "LeBron, they were able to get 58 points in the paintÂ  What's the perimeter defender's responsibility in trying to cut that down?",
        "8": "LeBron, the history of Boston in the playoffs (Indiscernible)",
        "9": "If they are committed to doubling Wade as good as they are, can they really hold him down like they kind of did most of last game?Ã‚Â  Or will he do more?",
        "10": "Do you get hungrier when you play a team like the Celtics, who you've had this type of history with?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "KG is a difficult coverÂ  First of all, he's a more prolific scorer than of Chandler and of HibbertÂ  And when he gets to shoot, his wing span isâ€‘â€‘ he shoots higher than anybody we have in this leagueÂ  So we have to do a better job of trying to help each other out and not expose ourselves as much with our coverages.",
        "1": "Well, we're going to have to go to itÂ  It's just how our lineup is being played right now, especially with CB being outÂ  I'm going to be guarding him either in the case of lining up against him to start the possession or a switch. I'm confident in itÂ  Just try to make it a little bit more tough on him and not give him so many relief layâ€‘ups with us being so aggressive on Ray in the post.",
        "2": "AbsolutelyÂ  I know that Dâ€‘Wade, once he gets a few easy buckets, he starts to shoot his jumper, he starts to get to the freeâ€‘throw line and he's very aggressive from that point on. I had it going early on in Game 3, but I'm going to need his dominant play as wellÂ  So I will make a conscious effort to try to get him going early.",
        "3": "No, nothing changed in our approachÂ  For me, I made a lot more jumpers than I've made in the first two daysÂ  But I still got into the paintÂ  I still put some pressure on the defenses, and Dâ€‘Wade did the same wayÂ  It just didn't result in the stat sheet saying we shot freeâ€‘throws.",
        "4": "No, they played great ballÂ  We came in with a game planÂ  They executed it more than we didÂ  And it showed in all the big points, as far as freeâ€‘throws, the points in the paint, things like thatÂ  So they played good ball.",
        "5": "Well, we're going to meet after thisÂ  'Spo is going to give us a game plan for Game 4Â  And if there's something as players that we see, we're going to give our opinion, and then we go and get ready.",
        "6": "We don't â€‘â€‘ honestly, we don't see it too muchÂ  We don't read into itÂ  I know I don't personallyÂ  I don't get involved in itÂ  It's one gameÂ  They protected the home court for Game 3. We get another opportunityÂ  That's the best thing about itÂ  We get another opportunity to play tomorrow, and we're going to try to win a game, go back home and try to finish it up.",
        "7": "We have to get back, first of all, in transitionÂ  Also low to Rondo and then KGÂ  They do a good job of getting points in the paint with Rondo's attacks and KG posting and in transitionÂ  And also Paul, he gets into the paint as well. So you have to be a little bit more aggressive defensively, but also a little bit smarter too.",
        "8": "These fans, they support their teamÂ  Of course we all know the history of this team, the history of the leagueÂ  So they give great support to their team, and their team fires up after itÂ  And they love it. It's always great to be a part of itÂ  Like I said, I've been on both sidesÂ  Been able to winÂ  I've lost more in this building than I've wonÂ  But it's always exciting.",
        "9": "As a team we have to figure out ways to exploit the doubleâ€‘teamÂ  He's goingâ€‘â€‘ he's always going to try to either come off the pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll, and when he posts up, he's going to bring two defendersÂ  So as his teammates, we have to make ourselves available and we have to make plays for ourselfÂ  And also when the doubleâ€‘team is not there, early and often try to get the ball to him early so he can attack without a doubleâ€‘team.",
        "10": "Hungrier?Ã‚Â  No, I don't need to be hungrier at this pointÂ  It's the Conference FinalsÂ  I'm fine and looking forward to it. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "1": "LeBron, can you sort of talk about the trouble that KG gave you guys in the second quarter and how much that's probably one matchâ€‘up that's going to be difficult to adjust to?",
        "5": "For both of you guys, how do you think you've managed without Chris?Ã‚Â  And any optimism he can be back soon?",
        "6": "LeBron, what did the Celtics do to thwart your comeback in the fourth quarter?",
        "7": "I know that attacking the basket is such a priority right nowÂ  Pointsâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘paint difference tonight, free throws, I think you two combined had 35 freeâ€‘throw attempts last game; five combined this gameÂ  What wasn't working tonight and how do you fix it?",
        "8": "(No microphone)."
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "I mean, KG is a difficult matchâ€‘up for a lot of guys, periodÂ  He started off really wellÂ  I think he had 12 points in the first quarter and got them off to a good startÂ  That's part of the reason why they had 58 points in the paintÂ  He opened up a lot for not only himself but for his teammates as wellÂ  And he's definitely a threat down there, and he made some huge shots.",
        "5": "I think we played great ball since he's been out, Game 1 of last roundÂ  We've played some great ballÂ  Guys have stepped up in his absenceÂ  Guys are going to have to continue to step up in his absence. We don't know when Chris will be backÂ  We're not going into next game hoping that he's going to be there, or whatever the case may beÂ  We have to prepare like he's not playingÂ  We will prepare for Game 4 like he's not playing.",
        "6": "It started way before thatÂ  We can't dig that big of a hole on ourselvesÂ  We were down 24 pointsÂ  When you start fighting uphill, we made a run, but any little mistake defensively or offensive rebound we give up or we miss a shot, we feel like we could have made it, or anything and they come down and get a bucket, it hurts, because you're trying to fight back the whole time. So we made a good run, but they was up too much and we got in too much in the hole.",
        "7": "I think we still was in attack modeÂ  Just the freeâ€‘throw attempts just doesn't show for itÂ  I hit a few jumpers as well, but I got into the laneÂ  Dâ€‘Wade definitely got into the lane, got some attack pointsÂ  We had 46 points in the paint, which is a really good clipÂ  We only made five threes, so it does show we had to make some shots in the paint as wellÂ  It just doesn't show for us. But we're attack guysÂ  We'll continue to attack and try to, you know, force the issueÂ  That's what we do, and that's why we're in this position now.",
        "8": "No, we're going to keep attackingÂ  That's what it's aboutÂ  We're attack playersÂ  We don't shoot many jumpersÂ  We never got to this point by shooting a lot of jumpersÂ  But we're an attack teamÂ  It starts with usÂ  And it trickles down to everybody else.

        "0": "LeBron, even after a night for the ages for Rajon, what were you thinking at the end?Ã‚Â  Was it relief, excitement, celebration?Ã‚Â  When this thing is finally over, what's going through your mind after a night like that for you guys and for Rajon?",
        "1": "Obviously it took Dwyane a while to get on the boardÂ  Can you talk about your feeling being on the courtÂ  Do you know he's always going to step up and come through at crunchtime?",
        "2": "LeBron, you mentioned the ups and downs of the gameÂ  Talk about with the look you had at the end of regulation, then you missed a couple of free throwsÂ  But you kept battling and had some nice assists, had the nice tipÂ  Just talk about the whole end of the game, regulation, overtime scenario for you.",
        "3": "LeBron, the way they play you guys on the screenâ€‘andâ€‘rolls, especially today they were showing the extra help early, and on Dwyane they were pretty much trapping until he passed the ballÂ  At certain points is it almost better to go just isolation, or does that kind of put you in a place where you don't want to be?",
        "4": "LeBron, so much is going to be talked about Rondo's game, obviouslyÂ  But just talk about the grit Rio showedÂ  He kind of kept you in the game in the first half."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "First of all, Rondo was absolutely amazingÂ  The performance he put on tonight will go down in the record booksÂ  He played the whole gameÂ  He made all the plays and tried to will his team to a victoryÂ  He showed tonight why he's an allâ€‘pro and one of the superstars in this leagueÂ  He's a unique playerÂ  He's an unbelievable playerÂ  He gave everything that he had tonight. As far as after the game, it was a battleÂ  We never felt like we won the game or lost the game until there were zeros on the clock and we looked up there and there was 115 to 111Â  We were able to win this game with so many ups and downs throughout the whole gameÂ  But it was exciting to be a part of it and to win.",
        "1": "AbsolutelyÂ  Always feel like he's going to make a play, no matter what's going on in his game at that momentÂ  I always feel the next play he's going to make a play to help us push forwardÂ  And he was definitely doing that late in the gameÂ  He made some unbelievable shotsÂ  Made some drives, kicked to UD for a bigâ€‘time shot as well. He made some big plays for us.",
        "2": "We ran a play, Dâ€‘Wade was able to hit me on a pass to the rim, and I missed the layâ€‘upÂ  I felt I had a good look at it, but I was kind of off balanceÂ  I was racing trying to get the offensive rebound to give us the last possessionÂ  I had a great look at it at the end of regulation, it just didn't go down. And then started the overtime, I missed two free throwsÂ  Like you said, I tried to help us winÂ  Whatever it took, whether it was offensive rebounds, trying to get a defensive stop or whatever the case may be, trying to be out there to help my teammates winÂ  I was happy to be able to make a few plays.",
        "3": "I mean, there's parts of the games where you have iso ball, but it's not what we want to doÂ  We don't want high doses of thatÂ  We want to continue to work our habits, continue to do what we've been doing over the course of the seasonÂ  If the pickâ€‘andâ€‘roll blows up, we have to get the ball from one side to another, and not try to force anythingÂ  Now the clock is at a disadvantage for us. They showed us something different tonight defensively, which we knew they wouldÂ  We knew they would make a changeÂ  That's why this series is going to be great, because both coaches are going to make adjustments throughout the seriesÂ  We get an opportunity to watch the film tomorrow, and we'll go from there.",
        "4": "AbsolutelyÂ  That's what I told Rio in the game after in the locker roomÂ  He kept us afloat by his playÂ  When Dâ€‘Wade didn't have it going, Rio made big shotsÂ  Especially in the second quarter, in the third quarter as well he kept us afloatÂ  He stepped up, made some big shots and gave us a liftÂ  He gave us a third punch that we needed in this gameÂ  So he played a great game.

        "0": "(No microphone).",
        "1": "Obviously, they come off a sevenâ€‘game series, play Saturday night, travel, how much do you guys want to sort of take advantage of their fatigue, and how much will you put your first quarter and your third quarter to maybe try to seize the moment against a more tired opponent?",
        "2": "You've seen the Celtics team in the playoffs many timesÂ  Can you see when you're looking out there, that Ray Allen is not quite the same (indiscernible).",
        "3": "LeBron, a couple of your teammates in the locker room talked about how you were able to frustrateâ€‘â€‘ maybe \"frustrate\" is too strong of a word, but disrupt Rondo early in the gameÂ  What did you do to make him get off to a rough start?",
        "4": "LeBron, you've obviously played against them a lot of timesÂ  Had some success in the half court against them and some not so muchÂ  What worked for you in the half court tonight that maybe didn't work earlier in the season?",
        "5": "LeBron, you play a lot of teams where the centers don't necessarily respect your centers offensively, Ronny and Joel and they'll play off of themÂ  KG probably does that better than anybody in the leagueÂ  What do you look for from your centers in order to sort of counteract that?Ã‚Â  And at the end of the game what makes you think those guys had a good game?Ã‚Â  What are you looking at?",
        "6": "LeBron, Rondo seemed particularly disappointed with how easily you and Dwyane were able to get in the paint tonightÂ  And he was asked what the counter would be to thatÂ  He said, nothing dirty, but those guys have to hit the deck, tooÂ  What's your response to that?Ã‚Â  And do you expect a more physical posture from Boston in Game 2?",
        "7": "LeBron, you guys missed 20 threeâ€‘pointers and only had 10 fastâ€‘break points, and yet you won by 10 pointsÂ  Do you feel there's another gear or two you can get into?",
        "8": "LeBron, you had 11 blocks as a team, can you speak to thatÂ  Does a big block do as much for a team as a big dunk?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't knowÂ  We just feel more comfortable out on the court, no matter who is out on the floor with usÂ  We try to complement one anotherÂ  When one guy is flowingÂ  We try to feed off of each other's energy and always try to stay in attack mode to help our teamÂ  We get to the freeâ€‘throw line as individuals or try to spread out our threeâ€‘point shooters and allow them to make plays as wellÂ  It's definitely a high comfort level right nowÂ  We just want to keep it going.",
        "1": "That's a veteran ballclubÂ  They're mentally toughÂ  One of the most mentally tough teams that we have in this leagueÂ  So we don't even put in the factor of them being fatiguedÂ  We don't let that be in our headÂ  We try to work our games, work our habits, the coaching staff gives us a great game plan, try to execute that, and hopefully it continues to result in wins for us.",
        "2": "I mean, just they are a championshipâ€‘caliber teamÂ  No matter what injuries goes on, I look at them as a top opponent, as a top contender, and as a competitive groupÂ  Anytime I look out there and I see Paul and I see Ray and KG and Rondo, no matter who they have in their supporting cast, I feel it's a championshipâ€‘caliber teamÂ  I approach every game with a high intensity both mentally and physically.",
        "3": "It's going to be tough on all of usÂ  We have to be in tune with RondoÂ  He's probably the number one unpredictable guy we have in our league as far as how he forces his actionÂ  A lot of his points come in transition where you kind ofâ€‘â€‘ you want to lull to him, but also he spreads off the threesÂ  He's that goodÂ  He's that good that he forces a lot of our triggersÂ  He forces us to pay a lot of attention to him, and then he's able to get him a shot or get someone else a shot. We try to make it tough on him, like we do any other guard or any other player in this leagueÂ  We try to make it tough for him and wear him throughout the gameÂ  But he's a great talent.",
        "4": "Defensively, no matter what year or group they have out there, they're greatÂ  So you try to get the ball moving from one side to anotherÂ  When it comes back to you, I try to attackÂ  I was able to attack early in the gameÂ  Also in a lot of my postâ€‘ups I was able to get to a lot of my shots I was comfortable with making. So just always try to be on attack, no matter what point of the game it isÂ  And I was able to get a couple to fall for me tonight.",
        "5": "It doesn'tâ€‘â€‘ what our complementary guys do never show up in the boxscore, especially our centersÂ  They go out there, they defend at a high levelÂ  They get us open offensively, setting great screens and transition and also in the halfâ€‘court setÂ  We find them, they try to go up there and finishÂ  Everything we get offensively from our centers is always a bonusÂ  It puts no pressure on them offensivelyÂ  We just want them to play hard, rebound and defend. We know the opposing team is going to sag off our centers, try to clog up the paintÂ  It's been like that the last two yearsÂ  But they understand their role, and that's what makes them so good.",
        "6": "That doesn't change anything for usÂ  We expect to hit the deck every single game, me and Dâ€‘WadeÂ  It's how we feel like teams approach usÂ  They feel like they need to put us on the floor, hardâ€‘foul usÂ  It doesn't change our approachÂ  We still have to be in the attack mode no matter what happens, because that's when we're at our best as a team.",
        "7": "We feel like we didn't play our best basketball tonightÂ  We had some great looks offensively, but we had a lot of breakdowns defensivelyÂ  So we didn't play our best gameÂ  And we want to just try to continue to get better throughout the seriesÂ  We come in tomorrow, we're going to watch a lot of film, break down the film, see the ways we can get better offensively and defensively. It's a good signÂ  It's a good thing for us, but we understand we didn't have our best game tonightÂ  So we will prepare and we will be better on Wednesday.",
        "8": "First of all, it let's us know we're activeÂ  We're playing the rim and playing the ballÂ  Definitely a defensive stop is just as effective as a big dunkÂ  They are both momentumâ€‘changing playsÂ  Especially when a guy feels like he has a good lane to the rim and someone comes over and gets a blockÂ  That definitely helps us offensively, because once you get the block in, most of our blocks aren't hit out of bounds, so it allows us to get out in fast break and get out on the floorÂ  So it helps us a lot.

        "1": "LeBron, after the pass toward the end, it looked like Kobe was barking at you at the timeÂ  Was he saying, shoot that?",
        "2": "What did you think of Kobe as an opponent kind of urging you to take that?",
        "4": "Talk about that surgeÂ  You hit six threeâ€‘pointers, you really brought the East backÂ  You made the game really competitiveÂ  Talk about that surgeÂ  Did you feed off of Kobe or Kevin Durant or you just did what you had to do?"

      "answers": {
        "0": "We've got a lot of season to goÂ  I'm on the right path, back to playing basketball how I play, and that's back to having fun at a high levelÂ  The best thing about this season so far we're playing some good basketballÂ  Our team feels that we are one right now, especially with last year under our belt, so we're just going to try to get better every day. DWYANE WADE:Ã‚Â  LeBron is playing at an MVP levelÂ  Obviously it takes a while to adjust, and I thought he did great last year, and I think he's adjusted now, and more comfortable now with the team and just in Miami, periodÂ  It was very tough last yearÂ  It was a different situation, but I think he's doing a great job, and he's playing like LeBron James that won backâ€‘toâ€‘back MVPs.",
        "1": "Yeah, he was telling me to shoot itÂ  I seen my teammate open for a splitâ€‘second, I told him I seen him open the first time and I didn't release the ballÂ  When I tried to throw it late, that's what usually happens and it results in a turnoverÂ  Definitely wish I could have that one back.",
        "2": "You know, you have some of the best competitors out on the floor at the same timeÂ  Not only me and Kobe, but D Wade and Durant and Melo and CPâ€‘3 and all the rest of the guysÂ  We all wanted to win, and it came down to the last minute or last seconds.",
        "4": "You know, that was a small piece of itÂ  I tried to do my part, but everybody else had a hand in, too, as wellÂ  D Will came off the bench and shot the ball well, and gave us 20 off the benchÂ  D Wade had a tripleâ€‘double and Melo played great, as well, in the second halfÂ  I just tried to do my part. Being a competitor, no matter Allâ€‘Star Game or not, you don't want to get blown outÂ  Of course not when you're going against your peers and you're going against great players, and you're playing with great playersÂ  I just wanted to try to pick it up and see if we could make a run at it, and we did."

        "0": "LeBron, given your performances late in games in these Finals, what's your assessment of your ability to play well under pressure?",
        "1": "LeBron, what in this Finals round were you personally unable to do that you wanted to do?",
        "2": "Considering all that you went through this past summer and all the effort you made to get here to specifically win a championship, what are your emotions losing The Finals now?",
        "3": "LeBron, obviously you've dealt with so much criticism for the last year that wasn't at all to do with basketball. When you're getting criticized for what's happening on the court, does that bother you?",
        "4": "Does it bother you that so many people are happy to see you fail?",
        "6": "LeBron, with all the pressure, the criticism, the expectations, did it ever get to a point where it just weighed heavy and affected you in any way?",
        "7": "What was going through your mind entering the fourth quarter knowing you guys had that hole to get out of? What was your mentality?",
        "11": "LeBron, we know it's a team game and a team loss, but we know the player you are. We've seen the things you've done. We know the aspirations you have. Do you take this as a personal failing?",
        "15": "LeBron, I know this may be tough to think about, but right now what do you feel like it's going to take for you to win a championship?",
        "16": "LeBron, you were a closer in the Chicago series, probably the best player in the NBA. No offense, Dwyane. Everyone is going to figure out or try to figure out what happened in these fourth quarters in terms of not closing like you did in the East Finals. What was the reason for that? And in terms of lacking your usual aggression, the way it appeared, everything okay off the court in terms of distractions or anything like that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I mean, sometimes you got it, sometimes you don't. And that was this case in this series. I was able to do things in the last two series to help us win ballgames. Wasn't able to do that in this series. Once you get to the playoffs, every game is pressure. You want to win. You have to win. And I mean, we've seen some of that in the Chicago series, we seen some of that in the Boston series. Even though we lost Game 4, we lost Game 4 in Philly, there's pressure in that series as well. So it doesn't matter which round it is. Once you get to the postseason, every possession counts.",
        "1": "Live in the paint. They did a great job of every time I drove, they brought another extra defender in front of me. They did a great job defensively. Very underrated defensive team. Took me out of a lot of things that I'm capable of doing or used to doing. It took us out of a lot of things we're capable of doing, that's getting points to the paint and getting to the free-throw line. So they did a good job. Much respect to them.",
        "2": "It hurts of course. I'm not going to hang my head low. I know how much work as a team we put into it. I know how much work individually that I've put into it, when you guys are not around. That's something people don't see. I think you can never hang your head low when you know how much work, how much dedication you put into the game of basketball when the lights are off and the cameras are not on.",
        "3": "No, that doesn't bother me. I understand this is a huge stage, and you want to perform well for nobody else besides your teammates. That's ultimately what it's about for me. If I can play well for my teammates, help my teammates win basketball games, then I'm always satisfied with that. It hurts me, and I get on myself when I'm not able to play well and help my teammates win.",
        "4": "Absolutely not. Because at the end of the day, all the people that was rooting on me to fail, at the end of the day they have to wake up tomorrow and have the same life that they had before they woke up today. They have the same personal problems they had today. I'm going to continue to live the way I want to live and continue to do the things that I want to do with me and my family and be happy with that. They can get a few days or a few months or whatever the case may be on being happy about not only myself, but the Miami Heat not accomplishing their goal, but they have to get back to the real world at some point.",
        "6": "I don't think so. I pretty much don't listen to what everybody has to say about me or my game or what I've done with my career. I don't get involved in that. This is year after year after year for me. Me as an individual, people write or say what they want to say about me. It doesn't weigh on me at all. Like I said, the only thing that weighs on me is when I don't perform well for my teammates and the guys that I play for every day. That's the only thing that weighs on me. Because I take pride in going out there and doing the things that need to be done to help my teammates win. That's it.",
        "7": "Honestly, it was about fourth-quarter defense and trying to get buckets. We got into a good groove to start the fourth. I think J.J. Barea's three at the end of the shot clock was a huge shot. Put them up seven. That was a huge shot. I think it was 81-77 at that time. He hit a shot, the three at the end of the shot clock. We played defense 23 straight -- great defense for 23 straight seconds and he hit a shot like that. So it took a little bit out of us. You don't want to dig a hole like that against anyone. Especially on your home floor going into the fourth.",
        "11": "Any time you feel like you get to the top of the mountain and you fall off, there's definitely a personal failure. It was a failure in '07 when we lost to the Spurs when I was in Cleveland, it's a failure now for myself losing to the Mavericks. Absolutely.",
        "15": "I can only prepare myself each year. In the summertime I'll put a lot of hard work into my individual game, try to bring my individual game to a team, and I work hard every day as an individual to go out there and perform at a high level for my teammates and for myself. I got close. Won two more games than I did in '07, and hopefully next time I get here I'll win two more games than I did in '11.",
        "16": "I've been in this league eight years. There's no distractions that can stop me from trying to chase an NBA championship. Not you guys, not anything that goes on that's not focused on my team and my teammates and what we're out there -- what we're out set to do. Like I said before, I work hard to try to put myself in position to play at a high level. When you go out on the court, does the ball always go in? Absolutely not. But the one thing I know, I never hold my head low in saying, I didn't do it the right way or I wish I would have did this. It's not about that. I put a lot of hard work into this season individually. We all did. So we have nothing to hang our heads low. Just use this as an extra motivation to help myself become a better player for next year.

        "2": "LeBron, you said that you've played well enough to win in these games. How frustrating is it knowing that the tough shots that they're hitting late, they go 13-for-19 from the three-point line, and you can't change any of that. You're still down 3-2. Do you feel you guys are still right where you need to be?",
        "3": "LeBron, you talked about the last 48 hours, have you looked at your shot in terms of technique or anything? Have you been analyzing why the shot just doesn't look the same of late?",
        "4": "There's urgency and there's pressure. How do you sort out the differences between that? And how do you tell how your teammates are handling those few things?",
        "5": "LeBron, can you talk about J.J. Barea, what you guys have to do to contain him a little better?",
        "6": "When you've looked at the fourth quarters, have you seen yourself being less aggressive?",
        "7": "LeBron, it's likely no athlete has been scrutinized the way you have prior to this. And I know you went through it a lot last summer and through the season, but this is The Finals. It's a bigger stage. What have you learned through the first week, week and a half of this that you can apply to the next few days about how to handle this and the attention that's on you? Because that's something Erik was just talking about, how your mentality of processing all that.",
        "8": "How much does all this stuff around you seep through to you in your mind when you're by yourself just hanging out?",
        "9": "LeBron, there's a video circulating that's gathered some buzz about you and Dwyane pretending to be sick, and there's been a lot of interpretations about what that was all about. Can you tell us what was going on.",
        "10": "LeBron, earlier this season when you and Dwyane said you guys had figured it out offensively, you said you weren't thinking about him, you were thinking about what you needed to do and you weren't worried about him getting his touches, you were worried about how you personally played. Now that you're in The Finals, are you overthinking whether Dwyane is feeling it and you don't want to disrupt that? Or are you going away from what you guys did to get figured out?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "The last 48 hours have been thinking about Game 5. Some of the opportunities we had to win. Some of the opportunities I had to make plays, and either made them or didn't. At one point we look at it we're up three with three and a half minutes to go. We had an opportunity. We played well enough to win that game, even though with them making 13 threes, unbelievable shooting for them. We still had an opportunity to win. I thought about that and also kind of shifted my focus to how can I be better and how can our team be better in Game 6. We worked all year to get home court, and even though we're in an elimination game, we feel like we still have a great opportunity with this series coming back to Miami, two games on our home floor.",
        "1": "I don't think it's too much. I feel like I'm in world-class condition. Like I said, anytime you get a little rest here, a little rest there, it definitely helps. I wouldn't say it's too much. I don't think so. I don't feel like I'm hurting my team for the time I'm out there. I don't feel like it's too much.",
        "2": "It's frustrating, of course. When you look at the three games we lost, we all had the opportunity to win. Game 2 being up 15. In Game 4, we had an opportunity. And in Game 5 we had an opportunity. It is frustrating when you look back at the film and you watch and you see some of the mistakes that you had, not only individually but as a team. But it's something you can't -- you have to try to move on. But also learn from those games where you had an opportunity to win and seeing the games where you won, where you took advantage of them. So I think it's a new game, Game 6 being tomorrow night, and we're looking forward to it coming back to our home floor.",
        "3": "At this point I don't think technique has anything to do with it. Shots go in, shots don't go in. I don't stop to think about my technique or anything like that. One thing about me, you just be aggressive. And when you have the shot, you take them. Some of the same shots I've taken in the other series, they went in. They're not going in for me right now, that won't deter me from taking that opportunity once I get them again.",
        "4": "I think the game of basketball can be pressure. It doesn't matter if it's The Finals or the Conference Finals or first round. Playoff basketball is all about pressure, how you can handle it. There's a sense of urgency because we're on an elimination game coming into Game 6. But it's something if I sit here and say we haven't seen everything to help us out to get to this position this year, I would be lying to myself and lying to our team. This is a position -- I mean, we wouldn't want to be in this position being down 3-2. But at the same time we're going to relish the opportunity being back on our floor.",
        "5": "I mean, honestly, J.J., he shot the ball extremely well. The guy hit four threes, three of them was at the end of the shot clock with him not even holding his follow-through. A guy like that once he gets into the lane and he gets a few lay-ups, get into the flow, his outside shot becomes better, just like a lot of us. Myself and D-Wade, if you allow us to get two or three lay-ups, we feel like we're in a good rhythm. So we have to do a better job of trying to keep him out the paint. If you keep him out of the paint early, that's better for us. He doesn't shoot the ball as well as he would if he gets a few lay-ups here, a few lay-ups there, a couple of free-throws. He's a key. We always say he's a key. J.J. being a key and J.T. being a key to their success.",
        "6": "I've seen myself being less aggressive at times. A few reasons is most of the time I feel like D-Wade has it going. In situations where in the past in the last series there was times I had it going, in the Chicago series or in the Boston series, and our team just rolled me offensively. Guys just try to pick it up, some way, somehow. D-Wade has been playing extremely well in the fourth quarter. CB has played well. And just haven't found my niche in the fourth quarter thus far. You look at it, tomorrow is another opportunity for me to make an imprint on this series in the fourth quarter and help our team win.",
        "7": "It's nothing that I've seen over The Finals that I didn't know coming into this series. I understood this is a huge series. It's a huge stage. I want to play well, of course. I want to help this team win a championship. That's all it's about. The things that you can't control, the ball going in for you, or you playing extremely well every single game. The game doesn't happen like that. If I wanted to be that way, I would love for it to be. I have to do what's best for our team to help put our team in a position to win ballgames. That's the only thing I can control.",
        "8": "The losses do. That's all it's about for me, winning and losing. Of course, I get on myself, I'm hard on myself about wanting to play well, because I feel like that's what I need to do for my teammates. But to answer questions about what's written about me or anything like that, I don't really feed into it. It's going to be written no matter what, no matter if I play well or not. I had a triple-double last game. I had a bad game in a lot of people's eyes. I understand that. That's just the situation I'm in. That's the bowl I'm in right now. I can only satisfy my teammates. That's the way I look at it.",
        "9": "I'm not feeding into that. If you guys want to feed into everything that not only myself or D-Wade or the Miami Heat do, I think that's a non-issue. There's bigger issues in this series than that.",
        "10": "I don't think so. I think we have figured it out in the sense of what makes our team successful. Just like in the last series, I feel like D-Wade was out of rhythm, I just tried to pick it up offensively. And it's kind of vice versa right now. I haven't been in a good rhythm offensively. He's tried to pick it up. Guys have tried to pick it up in my absence offensively. That doesn't mean that we're back to square one. We've worked to playing too many games to go back to square one. If I make a few plays here, make a few plays there, then the whole course changes from me being 8-for-19 last game to being 10-for-19. You just got to be able to stick through it, watch film and figure out ways that you can help this team win offensively, because that's what it's about also. THE MODERATOR: Thanks, LeBron.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you called this game the biggest of your career. Are you struggling at all with the pressure of The Finals, the pressure of the fourth quarter?",
        "1": "Do they need more offense from you in the fourth quarter?",
        "2": "You guys suffocated Derrick Rose and Jet in the fourth quarter of Game 1. Last two games Jet fourth quarter outscored you 16-2. Is he wearing you guys down? Is he just getting different looks? Why has Jet been able to explode in these last two fourth quarters?",
        "5": "Erik came in here and said the thing you guys need to do the most over the next day and a half is work through the idea of closing out games. What did you learn in that stretch in March about closing out games that you can apply now?",
        "7": "LeBron, what was the adjustment process like for you guys once Dwyane was out? Obviously coming out and starting the third quarter without him is not anything you guys are accustomed to doing.",
        "10": "LeBron, you said many times that your stats are irrelevant to you. Is that true at all with a triple-double, or does that rule still apply?",
        "11": "LeBron, in the two games you guys have won, Jason Terry didn't score a single point in the fourth quarter. In the games that they won, he scores eight or nine. Going forward, how much do you take on yourself to really shut him down in the fourth quarter?",
        "12": "LeBron, in the second quarter there seemed to be a concerted effort to get the ball to you in the post. They seemed to get away from that in the second half. Why did you get away from it and did you think about going down low in the stretch particularly with three minutes left when things were tight?",
        "13": "LeBron, at 102-100 you had the ball at the top and you took a three there. Did you think about maybe trying to drive by him, or was he giving you so much space that was the best play?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "No, I don't think so. I don't believe so. I know I'm not. We as a team, we played good enough to win again. Put ourself in position to win down the stretch. Everyone, guys made plays. They just made a few more than we did. That's what it came down to.",
        "1": "I don't think it was a case of offense again tonight. There was enough offensive play. We shot 52%, they shot 56%. We scored 103 points, they scored 112. The offense wasn't a problem.",
        "2": "He made big shots. He made some great three-point shots tonight. A hand contested in his face. Some of them was open. He's just aggressive. We always said when he plays well, they're very tough to beat. That's what he's done the last two games.",
        "5": "Well, it starts defensively. We've had a few breakdowns late in games in this series that we didn't have in the first three series. So it's something we know we can do. We just got to push through it. At this point we have no choice, honestly. We got two games left, and we worked hard all year to get home-court advantage. So we have to take advantage of it.",
        "7": "Just try to work our same offense. I was able to get into the lane a couple of times, hit out for threes, hit out for guys that got some lay-ups, and also I was able to get to the rim a couple of times, put a little pressure on the defense. But it's nothing that you really can change. It's our habits we've been working through all season. With him being out, we just try to do the same thing as if he was in, but knowing that one of our scorers is down. But guys had to come in and try to make plays and pick up the slack while he was out.",
        "10": "Absolutely. The only thing that applies to me is a win. A win or a loss. I could have made a couple more plays for my team. But at the end of the day, all it's about is a win or a loss. Triple-double means absolutely nothing in a loss. So we will be better in Game 6 on Sunday.",
        "11": "Like I said, it's never a one-on-one matchup. I said that when he was struggling in the first couple of games, the games that we won. I said it's never a one-on-one matchup. JT is the reason why, like I said, in the top vote-getters of Sixth Man of the Year every year. He does a great job of staying active, staying in rhythm and they get him the ball in the fourth quarter. So I take pride in it. Like I said, I'm not going to always stop him or hold him under his average. I would hope so. He gets enough looks, he gets enough cracks at it, he's going to make a few in. We have to make sure we stay locked in and not allow him to get open ones like he had tonight.",
        "12": "Honestly, we just worked our game. I was able to get the ball in the post a few times in the first half. It worked. Some of them didn't work. Second half with D-Wade being out to start the second half, I took it upon to be a little more of a ball-handler, get guys into our offense. But we just try to take what the defense gives us. We have nothing to say about our offense tonight. We shot 53% from the floor. These guys shot 57. Shot almost 70% from the three-point line. Offensively had nothing to do with why we lost this game. We just couldn't get enough stops down the stretch.",
        "13": "I didn't think about it. D-Wade gave it to me, I had enough room and I shot it. Shots I made before. I just didn't make it that time."

    "qa": {
      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you're a two-way player, of course. At what point do you in the fourth quarter say, one guy on their team is killing us. I'm going to go guard that guy, and the guy is Dirk?",
        "1": "LeBron, I've never heard you make an excuse, fatigue as an excuse ever in your career. But you've played the full second half of every game for the last month, almost. Is your energy level where you need it to be at the very end of these games?",
        "2": "LeBron, we've seen you in the last couple of rounds just take over fourth quarters against Boston, against Chicago, put teams away. So obviously you know how to do that, when to do that. When you say after a game like last night, I wasn't aggressive enough, how does that happen? How does it get to a point whether you're lulled into something or you just kind of get lost?",
        "3": "Scoring aside, it looked like times you weren't even involved in the play. Is that unusual? And is that because as you said, if you were struggling do you kind of withdraw a little bit?",
        "4": "LeBron, throughout Dwyane's time with Miami, he's always taken pains, it seems like, to get guys involved early. Together you guys have taken the same approach all season. Does tomorrow have to be a night where you come out from the word \"go\" and start looking for your shots first and opposed to getting other guys necessarily involved?",
        "5": "With all the things that have been said over the last 11 months or whatever it is, DeShawn Stevenson was saying today that he thought you checked out in the fourth quarter. At this point in the year does something like that even matter much?",
        "6": "LeBron, you watched extra film last night and with the team today you did that and you'll practice today. What else are you going to do to use the time until tip-off tomorrow night to become different in Game 5?",
        "7": "Is there anything that helps you do that? Music? Talking to anyone in specific? Things like that?",
        "8": "LeBron, we know since last summer you've been criticized for so many things, some of them fair, some not fair, are you saying everything that was said or written about last night, is that mostly fair?",
        "9": "Do you fall into a trap sometimes knowing now you have more help than you ever had, sometimes you don't think you have to have it going right away?",
        "10": "LeBron, when you go through some struggles, do you almost relish the opportunity to come back from them when things don't come easily?",
        "11": "LeBron, with your pick-and-roll offense, a lot of times the guy on the weak side is sort of in the parking lot a little and it takes away from the dynamic of you and Dwyane. Is there something you guys can do so you're both active more often? How hard is it to be that guy sort of in the parking lot there who is not necessarily involved to keep yourself in the play?",
        "12": "LeBron, you're a competitive guy and I know you're going to move on and yesterday is yesterday and Game 1 is Game 1, but with yesterday's point total and the loss, were you bothered? Are you upset? Ticked off? What was the emotion after the game even though you may have gotten over it today?",
        "13": "I don't know if you know the answer to this, LeBron, I certainly don't. I didn't check the tape. Do you have any clue how many times you got in the paint last night?",
        "14": "It didn't seem like a lot, though, did it?",
        "15": "LeBron, how early or late into the game did you realize that you didn't have it offensively the way you wanted? And what bothered you most about what you did or didn't do last night?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I don't think -- what do you mean? We have matchups. We have schemes. It's not one guy that's hurting us. I think Tyson Chandler had an unbelievable game last night. Offensive rebounds, he had nine offensive rebounds. Dirk made shots. He can make shots against anyone. He can make shots against me. He can make shots against anyone in this league. Just try to make it hard on him. We did that.",
        "1": "You can always use -- if you can get a minute or two minutes there, it helps anyone. It would help me as well. I feel like I'm in condition where I can still be effective. I just have to figure a way I can be effective on both ends of the floor. Last night, you know, eight points is definitely inexcusable for myself. I hold myself up to a higher standard than that. I had to do a better job of putting myself in situations where I can benefit myself and my team, no matter how many minutes I'm out on the floor.",
        "2": "You're at a point where you just not in a good rhythm. You start aiming shots, you start thinking about plays too much. You start thinking about the game too much and instead of going out and reading and react and playing the game. It happens to all of us where you get to a point where you feel so out of rhythm, you try to impact the game some other way than offensively. I try to rebound the ball, try to defend. If I wasn't -- had it going offensively, just trying to get guys to defend, to play two on the ball where I can give it up to someone so someone else can make the play. When you're out of rhythm, it's tough to get back into the flow in that particular game. I guess the best thing about it is you try to watch that film, see the things you can do better the next game and then go after it.",
        "3": "You just have to pick your spots. At times -- I watched the film again last night when I got back to the room. I watched the film today with the whole unit, and there were times I definitely could have attacked. When you're out of rhythm, I guess it feels like you have nothing going offensively. You just try to focus your play somewhere else. At the same time I have to make sure I keep myself active, some way, somehow. Getting offensive rebound, the put-back, cutting when someone else has the ball. Figure out a way to still be effective even if I'm not bringing the ball up or initiating the offense.",
        "4": "I think it's that time. I think it's that time that I try to get myself going individually. But at the same time still play my game. And when I say be more aggressive, that doesn't mean be more aggressive and have to shoot the ball. It just means being more aggressive and looking for opportunities to get a look. And if I bring two defenders and give the ball up. That's something I've done my whole career. Still be aggressive but at the same time get guys involved and have to do that.",
        "5": "I like when I smile and the flashes go off and -- it's pretty cool. (Laughter). Like I said, I'm not -- DeShawn, he's been talking for a long time, since out Washington-Cleveland days. I don't let that get to us. Those guys are playing well. We're playing well. It's a three-game series. Talk is cheap. You have to play the game of basketball. Let the scores and the plays define the game. We don't get caught up in that too much.",
        "6": "Just mental. It's just a mental -- your mind state going into the game tomorrow night. You watch film, you watch too much. You don't want to drag on what happened last night. You get into the books, you get into your studies, and then you move on. It's a new day. Tomorrow is a new game. And just like when we moved on from Game 2 to Game 3, we will move on from Game 4 to Game 5 and try to come out with a better outcome.",
        "7": "No. Not really. Just being back on the court. Just rushing the opportunity to be back -- having another opportunity. If it was the Super Bowl, I would be kicking myself in the foot. We have one game. That's it. The great thing about this, it's a series. No matter if you can have a bad game, you can always make an imprint on the next game. Game 5 is a huge game.",
        "8": "I haven't read anything that was written. I didn't play well, especially offensively. I know that. I've got to do a better job of helping this team win basketball games, especially late, no matter what it is. If that's getting an offensive rebound, like I said, making a couple of baskets, being more aggressive to give my guys opportunities to get open looks. I have to do that. That's what my job is. That's what I'm here for.",
        "9": "You can. Because you know you have other guys. You have other options. You feel like you don't have to take over games. You don't have to take as many shots. Sometimes you can get out of rhythm doing it. I think we've all seen that at this point -- at some point this year. Kind of waiting and waiting and waiting, and then it gets to a point you're just out of rhythm. We've all been through that. But we figured it out through games, through practices, how we can all be effective at the same time. And we need to put it together now.",
        "10": "I have. Both series, the Boston series and the Chicago series, there was a couple of games I didn't play well. You come back and you just do better the next game. I understand that I have the ability to go out there, my teammates give me all the confidence in the world to go out there and try to help them win a basketball game. You definitely relish the next moment. I'm looking forward to it.",
        "11": "It's a challenge. But at the same time like I said, you have to figure out a way to still be active in the offense. That's cutting behind the defense and making yourself closer to the ball. You have to do that. D-Wade does a great job sometimes of cutting baseline getting dunks, getting lay-ups. I try to flash behind the defense at times when I don't have the ball necessarily and get some looks for myself or for my teammates. You can't ever feel like you're not in the offense even though you're on the weak side. You always have to be like the ball is coming to me, the ball is coming to me even when it's all the way on the other side. You have to stay in tune with whatever is going on if that instance.",
        "12": "Absolutely. I criticized myself. I was hard on myself all last night. Anytime I feel like I could have played better and the team loses, that's what it's all about. If I have a bad game and we win, I'm hard on myself, but at the end of the day we win the basketball game. That's ultimately what it's all about. When we lose and I don't play well, and I feel like I could have did one or two more things to help our team win or get over the hump, you're definitely hard on yourself. That's just me. That's just the make-up of who I am.",
        "13": "I have no idea.",
        "14": "There's always opportunities you feel like you can get more in the paint. I had a few times -- I can always get more, be more aggressive. I said that last night after the game. I have to be more aggressive, even if that takes for me getting out in the open court sometimes, getting the rebound, getting out in the open court where I'm at my best or playing in the post. I'm playing a lot in the post, too. So I'm in the paint there. They're bringing double-teams, I'm able to get it out to a lot of our shooters. I don't know the exact number.",
        "15": "I don't know at what instance I felt like I was out of rhythm. I think what bothered me the most is that it resulted in me being out of rhythm. It resulted in us having a loss. That's what it's all about for me. At no point should I ever feel like I'm out of rhythm, because my teammates key on me and they look at me to come through for them. There's times when you're out of rhythm, it's hard to get back into it. But you have to figure out a way to still be an impactful player on both ends of the floor. Like I said, if that's getting a defensive stop, if that's creating a charge defensively, or getting an offensive rebound to get us another possession, you have to figure out those ways to do it to help your team win. I didn't do that last night. Those are the things that I pride myself on that hurt me the most. I'll just be hard on myself and figure out a way to do it better the next game.

        "3": "LeBron, could you talk about your offensive night. And did you defer too much?",
        "4": "LeBron, in the last series when Dwyane said he felt his shot was out of rhythm, he came to the gym extra and shot. What are some of the things you're going to do over the next day and a half to be a better player in Game 5?",
        "5": "Where do you feel your confidence is with your shot right now?",
        "7": "LeBron, you guys had a commanding lead in the fourth. You guys would have gone up 3-1. Mavericks had nothing going. Shooting a low percentage. Dirk was sick. How do you think you guys ended up losing this game? What happened?",
        "8": "LeBron, what were they specifically showing you defensively that didn't let you get going offensively?",
        "10": "LeBron, single digits probably the last thing you expected tonight. I think for the first time in your playoff career. What's the emotion right now? Is it anger? Is it frustration? Is it letting it go? Is it some combination? How can you sum up what's going through you right now?",
        "11": "LeBron, talk about that momentum-building inspiration to come back, because you didn't do that well tonight. How will it inspire you to come back even stronger with more of a vengeance?",
        "12": "Talk about the competition between you and Jason Terry. He came out inspired."
      },

        "3": "Definitely didn't play great offensively. I got to do a better job of being more assertive offensively, not staying out of rhythm offensively the whole game. But I think one thing I try to concentrate is, if I get two guys on me, try to make my teammates better, hit those guys for open looks. They made some great looks, but at the same time I have to keep myself in rhythm while I'm doing that as well.",
        "4": "You know, with these games, every other day, there's not much gym time you can have. You want to try to stay off your feet as much as possible. If I feel like I need to come to the gym and get some extra shots up, I will. Absolutely just to get my shot back going and my confidence with my shot going. If I feel I need to do that after practice, tomorrow night I will do that.",
        "5": "I'm confident with my ability. It's about going out there and knocking them down. When you have the opportunity, you have to knock them down. Your teammates give you the confidence. They give me the confidence all year, all postseason. So I have to go out there and make them count.",
        "7": "I don't think anything is commanding in this series. These are two games teams trying to figure out a way to make plays down the stretch. We've seen in this series seven or eight-point lead is nothing. You just got to continue to execute offensively, continue to grind defensively. And put yourself in the best possible chance to win late.",
        "8": "I think they haven't changed their coverages on me. Me just being more assertive, that's what it's about. I got the ball in the post a few times, and I seen double-teams. I tried to kick it out to guys and they've made shots for us. At the same time I can't let that stop my aggression when they bring two on the ball. I still got to make plays for my team, but also make plays for myself to keep me in the rhythm of the game.",
        "10": "I think the fact that it happened in a loss is the anger part about it. That's all that matters to me. If I had had eight points and we won the game, I could be satisfied. I don't really care about that. The fact I could have did more offensively to help our team, that's the anger part about it, and myself. I'll come back in Game 5 and do things that needs to be done to help our team win.",
        "11": "We've always been a good bounce-back team. Anytime we have a loss or we feel like we could have did better in one game, we've always been able to bounce back. Individuals have been able to bounce back, including myself, D-Wade and CB and the guys. We understand it's a golden opportunity. Game 5 we come here and we play as well as we did tonight, we execute a little better down the stretch, we give ourselves a good chance to win Game 5 and go home and be able to close out.",
        "12": "Jason Terry is a great player. When he plays well, Dallas plays well. He's the reason why these guys are in The Finals and that's the reason why he's been one of the top guys and Sixth Man Award every year, because he plays well for this team. It's a good show tonight by both teams. They made one or two more plays down the stretch than we did. We look forward to Game 5, and try to come out here with a win.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, I'll just ask you the same thing: Can you give me a few adjectives? What did Chris Bosh's eye look like during that game?",
        "1": "Have you guys seen growth from him? Dwyane has talked about seeing growth all year. What growth have you seen during this series?",
        "2": "LeBron, you score in Game 1, you guys win. Yesterday you're a distributor at the end you guys win, but still there's LeBron stories and LeBron criticism. Are you at the point you feel like you can't win?",
        "3": "Adjustment-wise they changed Jason Terry against you, getting him the ball a little bit earlier in Game 2. Now they've struggled a little bit at the end of games with your guys' defense. Actually at the beginning getting big deficits. What adjustments do you expect now for tomorrow night?",
        "4": "LeBron, you and Dwyane have talked recently especially you don't care who finishes the game as long as you win. How did that process develop this year? And was there a point in the season where you stopped worrying about what the perception was out there?",
        "5": "I know you're somebody who cares a lot about legacy. You've had series in your career where you put up big numbers and not won the series. Do you care about what your numbers will look like when it's over?",
        "6": "LeBron, you had to get past Boston obviously in an earlier round to get here, and stopping them with your defense against their offense. Any way the Mavericks here compare to the options that Boston has?",
        "7": "LeBron, for years you played against Dwyane and probably in some cases guarded him. What's the difference between him now in '11 and when he was in '05 and '06 in the years you've seen him?",
        "8": "LeBron, even though you guys knew when you decided to make all this happen, you guys knew there would be times where you would share all kinds of roles, be it the ball at the end or the leadership, did it take you some get getting used to when Dwyane could be vocal, be harsh with you? You probably haven't had that a whole lot in your life. Did it take you time to get used to?",
        "9": "LeBron, you mentioned you've been to the Finals before. Experience-wise, is there a difference between being in The Finals or winning the Finals? And when I say that, have you noticed anything different with Wade even though you've known him for so long in these three games?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It didn't look well. All game you could see it watering. You could see him messing with it. Just trying to keep a tissue during time-outs to keep it padded. But he fought through it. And then you definitely respect that.",
        "1": "CB is really hard on himself. He's his own critic. He knows when he's not playing well. As teammates we try to keep him upbeat, let him understand how important he is to this team. He's grown. Not only just this series but throughout the whole postseason. This is the furthest he's ever played in a postseason. So he's excited, and he's done some great things for our team. He's going to continue to do great things for our team. We always say he's the most important player to our team.",
        "2": "No, I did win. We won. (Laughter). That's all that it's about. You know me, anybody that knows me throughout the years, all I care about is the W. No matter if I'm scoring. I'm not just a scoring guy. I've got a lot of points in my career. I have had some teammates who have given me great confidence and ability to go out there and score a lot of points. But I've done other things. I don't have to score points to be effective. Not only did Chris Bosh make the game-winning shot, but D-Wade had a hockey assist. I got the assist to CB and Udonis Haslem set the screen on Dirk to get him a wide-open shot. That's what it's about. This is a team game. Even though I know I get a lot of the headlines, bad headlines, D-Wade gets a lot of the great headlines, CB gets a few headlines, this is a team game. We understand as a team we have to play together to win. It's not just about me.",
        "3": "I don't think it can't be too many. I think there are slight adjustments both teams make from game to game. Like I said, Game 4 of The Finals, which you've been working on all season since training camp is what you have. There's not too many things you can change. You can make slight tweaks offensively, defensively that can make you be a little bit more on point when you see a situation happens. But right now it's about the team that's going to play hard, going to use their instincts and just play on a string. You have to trust one another as teammates both ends. Not only us, but Dallas as well.",
        "4": "I think when our communication just -- we didn't care about -- it's all about winning. Once we started communicating that -- I think it started early in the season when we just were struggling. We were trying to be too unselfish. I've always said that trying to change our game, I thought that was going to be for the better of the team. At the end of the day, we had always just say whoever has it going, we kind of just go to. D-Wade had it going last night. I have had it going at points in this postseason where they've come to me, come to me and I've been able to close for our team. It doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's the win. If it's D-Wade making a crucial basket or me making a crucial basket or last night, CB making the game-winning shot, that's all that's about.",
        "5": "No, I just want to win. Individual, I think my individual stats will take care of itself. Like you said, in a series I've averaged 38 points a game and we've lost in the Eastern Conference Finals against Orlando. This is a team game. My resume will speak for itself after I'm done with this game of basketball. What me and my teammates are trying to accomplish now is the only thing I'm worried about. When I'm done, I'll let you guys figure where I should be placed.",
        "6": "They're very similar, because they force you to help -- they have so many dynamic players on the court at one time. You look at Boston, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Rondo, these four guys can all break you down at one time. So everyone is live. You can't relax off anyone of them because they'll all make you pay. That's the same with this Dallas Mavericks team. When you are coming down the stretch and you have Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, with Dirk also and Shawn Marion and Tyson Chandler who also can create things off the glass, you never have a chance to relax, ever. So mentally you have to be in tune, because if you do, like we've done a few times in this series, they make you pay.",
        "7": "I think the difference is he had a super duper green light. Like he told you before, he had no conscience in '06. He knew that he really had to go out and score 30 every night to give his team a chance to win at times. He's a smarter player now. That just comes with age. It comes with experience. It comes with games that you play throughout the course of your years. I mean, he's the same great player I faced my first seven years in the league. A guy that can break you down off the dribble, create at the rim, can make shots from the outside. At the same time, a two-way player who also plays defense at the same high intensity. I just think he's a little older, but not old at all. Just a little older.",
        "8": "Not at all. I've never been afraid of constructive criticism. From my coaches, from my high school teammates. I had four best friends in my high school team. Those guys would get on me all the time if I ever did anything wrong. Something I've been going through my whole life. When you have good friends and you have friends they are not afraid to tell you when you're wrong. That's on the court or off the court when you're doing stuff that shouldn't be done. So it wasn't hard to adjust to. I understand that if he's yelling at me or trying to tell me to do something better, it's for the better of the team, to help me get better individually, vice versa. It didn't take no time to get used to. I know I'm not bigger than this team or I know everything. I still got a lot of improvement to do.",
        "9": "The only difference for me in '07 and now, it takes a lot more preparation. Being young, I wasn't ready for the preparation for the NBA Finals at that point. Being my first time. I wasn't prepared mentally. Coming into this season, I prepared from day one. Being around two guys who had already won rings, three guys including Eddie House and Udonis and D-Wade, I knew how to prepare throughout the course of the season to get to this point. So it is great when you are around guys who have been in this moment and who actually got to the mountaintop, to lean on at times. We have a luxury. We have a luxury here. We got guys that have been in this moment before and not afraid to be in it again. THE MODERATOR: Thanks, LeBron. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "1": "LeBron, we've seen you keep going at guys even if they're having cold shooting nights. Describe that mentality in particular as applied to Bosh tonight, wasn't having a great night and the game on the line, you gave him the ball.",
        "2": "For both you guys, a lot of what the Mavericks do starts on the perimeter a long ways from the basket. Seemed like tonight you pushed farther and farther out to make what they were doing at the beginning of plays tougher and you created a lot of turnovers on the perimeter. Is that because you don't have a fear of what happens against this team closer to the basket? Does that make sense? Are they so perimeter-driven by how they run their offense and shooting so many jumpshots that it makes it easier on you guys to take chances out high?",
        "4": "LeBron, three games in a row for you fourth quarter, not much. That's the moment superstars become superstars. Seems like you are almost shrinking from it. What's going on?",
        "6": "LeBron, what did you think when you saw it?",
        "9": "LeBron, it doesn't seem like there have been many teammates who feel empowered enough to do that. What's that moment like and what's it like having a teammate that, heck, at this moment I'm going to tell you what I need to tell you whether you're LeBron James or just the 12th guy on the roster?",
        "10": "What did he say when he got in your face?",
        "11": "It's midnight. You can say it."
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "It's all about trusting your teammates. D-Wade, we ran a two-three pick-and-roll. They put two on the ball. D-Wade hit me first. I had Tyson Chandler closing on me. I saw CB wide open. I don't care if he missed 15 in a row, he was wide open and that's his sweet spot. He was able to knock it down. It's the trust we have in each other's ability, no matter what the point of the game is at.",
        "2": "It's not even that. We play our defense. This is the toughest offense we've played all year as far as how many guys they put on the floor that can make plays. Not only for themselves, but for others. Unbelievable shooting team. And they make you stay in tune. You can never relax or they make you pay. Our defense always tries to extend offenses further than where they usually start. That's just our defense. It has nothing to do about them not being a paint presence or anything like that. It's just our defense. That's how we played all postseason all year.",
        "4": "I think you're concentrating on one side of the floor. All you're looking at is the stat sheet. Honestly, I'm a two-way player. Since D-Wade had it going offensively, so we allow him to handle the ball, bring it on offensively. You should watch the film again and see what I did defensively. You'll ask me a better question tomorrow.",
        "6": "Like D-Wade said, we had all the confidence in the world in our defensive scheme. UD wanted that matchup in Game 2. So we knew when he got this matchup, he was going to make Dirk take a tough shot. He made that shot before. He will make it again. At least we just make him work for it. Make him take a turn-around jumper. UD stayed in front of him and it rimmed out. It was a huge stop for our team.",
        "9": "It's just we're teammates. At this point there's no room to hold anything back. There's nine or eight days left in the season. I think our friendship allows us to don't care about that moment. It's living in the moment. That situation he had every right to say what he had to say to me. As a competitor, you love when guys challenge you. He challenged me in the locker room at halftime. He challenged me on the court. As a competitor, like I said, I respect that.",
        "10": "Something that -- I don't know if my kids are asleep right now.",
        "11": "No, my kids stay up late. DWYANE WADE: They'll watch ESPN tomorrow."

        "0": "LeBron, because everything tends to be bigger with this team and the fall-out over the enjoyment of the moment. Are you concerned that might temper your team's enthusiasm, or are you guys going to savor the moment and if you get emotional, so be it?",
        "1": "LeBron, Spo talked after Game 1, and as he has throughout the playoffs, about all you did was win one game. The message clearly being don't get too high. How has this team avoided not getting too low after the game ended?",
        "2": "LeBron, you've been in a lot of situations in your career where it's been 1-1 after two, regardless of what the format is. Can you talk about how important a Game 3 in that situation is.",
        "3": "LeBron, Erik said when he replayed the tape today, he said you guys knew. You identified it immediately.",
        "4": "Particularly on defense. Were there things that kept happening over and over, specific things? Was there one thing?",
        "5": "Now that you guys have been able to watch the film, what was going wrong offensively at the end of the game?",
        "6": "What about you personally, when you have a break like this, when there's the off-day and this, are you watching a lot of film? Or is it more you get inside of your own head?",
        "7": "Do you feel that Shawn Marion has been effective guarding you? And if you feel that way, why so? Also, did you guys anticipate the offense that he would bring, scoring a lot more than he has in the regular season or the last series?",
        "8": "LeBron, you've taken on the challenge of guarding Jason Terry to a lot of effectiveness. There's been a lot of expectation you'll step up and take more of an assignment on Dirk. Have you guys talked about that and come to a plan with that?",
        "9": "LeBron, you said the offense was working okay but it seemed many times whether it was yourself or Dwyane were taking shots with two or three seconds left on the shot clock. Maybe the ball was a little stagnant. Talk about that, why is that happening? Is it their defense? Also, you've only taken six free throws in two games. I think you're fifth in the NBA this year in free-throw attempts per game. Is it something they're doing? Is it something you're not doing? Can you talk about that as well."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "That's part of the game. We're an emotional team. When we make plays, we can congratulate one another. I don't see why this whole thing has been blown out of proportion. I just look at it in the case of I think -- I've seen Dallas go on plenty of runs before. You know, if JT hits a three and they make a big run, if he runs down the court doing the whole wings expanded, do we count that as a celebration as well? I just think everything gets blown out of proportion when the Miami Heat does things.",
        "1": "It's been our motto, it's been our make-up all year. In the playoffs it's a win or a loss. However it comes by, it's a win or a loss. We've moved on from Game 2, seen the mistakes we've made. Seen some of the great things we've done as well. It's a win or loss. The series is tied 1-1. We never get too high or too low in the series. We haven't gotten too high or low in the regular season as well. We move on to the next challenge and go from there.",
        "2": "It's very important. We understand that. We are coming out with that mindset, like we had in Game 1 or Game 2. The same mindset. It starts defensively. We have to be in tune as close to 48 minutes as possible, especially versus this team who shoots the ball extremely well, who plays extremely well, especially at home. But it's a sense of urgency. That's the only way we have approached games. We've never went to a game saying this isn't a must-win for us or it's not a sense of urgency. That's the only way we know how to play, when we feel like we're desperate. It's the only way we approach games.",
        "3": "Right.",
        "4": "I think it was a few minor breakdowns we don't have. And once those minor breakdowns happened, it allowed them to get into a rhythm. Even though we played great defense in some of the later possessions, they were in a comfort zone at that point. We gave up two wide-open threes without contest to J-Kidd and to Dirk. A wide open lay-up to JT off a missed shot, a missed three, and he got a wide open lay-up. We did a lot of things uncharacteristic. It happened. I don't know why we couldn't score on offense. At the end of the day there's been times we haven't been able to score for quarters on offense, but we've been able to get the stops. That's the make-up of our team. We understand no matter what happens offensively we have to be in tune. We lost our edge.",
        "5": "I don't think offensively -- after rewatching the film, we got into a lot of great sets. Besides two or three possessions out of our last 14 possessions, it was pretty good. We had a few shots, I missed a lay-up at the rim. Mario Chalmers missed a wide-open lay-up. We ran some offense where Chris Bosh got in the post. He mishandled it out of bounds. UD got an offensive rebound with a minute left and mishandled it, saved it and they got a lay-up to tie the game. So we had some really good possessions. They just didn't go down. At the end of the day, that's not where we lost the game. Like I said before, our team -- there has been times we haven't been able to score offensively, but it hasn't stopped us from keeping that same concentration or even more of a concerted effort to play defensively in the game.",
        "6": "A little bit of both. I know I'm excited for the game tomorrow. It hurt. We had time to let it hurt us as much as it could yesterday after the game. But today is a new day. And we're back and focused. We're a confident bunch. Me personally, I'm looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be fun.",
        "7": "I think Shawn Marion has done a great job. Especially offensively. He's picked up his game offensively. Hanging around the rim, getting some lay-ups, getting some tip-backs, playing around the rim. His activity throughout the first two games has been pretty good. I take it upon myself to not only lock in at the beginning, but whoever is on him to lock in a little bit more. Because he's been very effective. I don't feel like it's one guy in this league that can stop me one-on-one. There's always a defense that's looking at me when I have the ball. He's the guy that's guarding me, but there's no one-on-one guy that can guard me.",
        "8": "Obviously, we look at it as we have enough guys not only can guard Jason Terry, guard Dirk. It's a team thing. It's not LeBron versus Shawn Marion, LeBron versus Dirk Nowitzki or LeBron versus JT or DeShawn Stevenson versus Dwyane Wade. It's not about that. It's about the team. Even though you have a one-on-one matchup on the court, there's a team defense that's put behind it. So if I get caught on him, it's not like I'm playing him one-on-one. We have a team defense and guys help each other. That's how you become successful in this league by being able to have a back line behind you. When you guard someone as great as Dirk or as great as JT is, you have to have a back line. It's never one-on-one. It's not a one-on-one thing. We get caught up on the one-on-one matchups a lot. There's always a defense that's behind it.",
        "9": "I think personally I do have to be more aggressive in the paint. Six free-throws in two games -- I do that in my sleep in one game. So that's not me. So I'm going to make a concerted effort to be more aggressive to try to get to the rim, create some more opportunities for myself and my teammates. I understand that. But I think we just had a few -- they extended their defense late in the game. They did some things defensively that they hadn't done throughout the first two games all the way. They started to blitz me, D-Wade's pick-and-rolls, a lot of our sets kept us on the perimeter. We didn't get into our sets early enough to give us more time. So we had to take contested long-range threes. I think I took two. D-Wade actually took one. So I think the best thing about our team and the best thing about me and D-Wade individually, we get an opportunity to watch the film and know when that happens again, we know how to attack it. And to not settle as much or to get the defense moving a little bit more where we can create not only better shots for ourselves but for our team, and we're not forcing things at the end of the shot clock.

      "questions": {
        "0": "Guys, Dwyane, when you hit the three to go up 15, LeBron, you kind of started the celebration right in front of the Mavs' bench, which turned into a kind of synchronized handshake in front of the Mavs' bench. Some of the Mavs players mentioned that may have been the turning tide. What were your thoughts on how that all went down?",
        "2": "LeBron, you guys seemed to be pounding the ball a bunch at the end instead of running through the offense that got you to that point. Was there a sense sometimes that you felt you can run enough clock and it would end or did you get out of what had been working?",
        "4": "Can you talk about the difference in your mindset from going up with a 2-0 lead, where they have to win four of the last five, to suddenly the series is even, they've regained home-court advantage, and you're going there for the next three?",
        "6": "For two guys who pride yourselves on defense as much as you guys do, to lose in this particular way, does that get your competitive juices or affect you in a different way than another loss?",
        "8": "LeBron, one last thing about the celebration thing: Do you think maybe it's a bigger issue because it happened right in front of their bench, in their personal kind of space, maybe that's why it's a bigger deal than just a normal celebration?",
        "11": "Dwyane and LeBron, both of you, a lot was made of Dirk and his left hand during the week. He finished two of the last three baskets at the rim with his left hand. Can you comment on his ability to go to his off hand when he was hurt at the end of the game when it mattered most?",
        "13": "LeBron, it seemed like the Mavs were trapping you pretty hard coming off screens there at the end of the fourth quarter. Was that differently than they played you the rest of the game? And if not, what exactly bogged down your offense?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It was no celebration at all. I was excited about the fact that he hit a big shot, and we went up 15. The same thing we've done over the course of the season. There was no celebration at all. We knew we had seven minutes to go still to close out the game. As far as celebration, that word has been used with us all year. But we knew how much time was left in the game still.",
        "2": "I think offensively we just weren't in a good rhythm. But it's not even -- offensively we've been out of rhythm before. At the end of the day, we hang our hats on our defense. I think they were 1-for-10 the first four or five minutes in the first part of the fourth quarter. It was 88-73; end up scoring 22 points in the last seven minutes. They only scored 24 in the whole fourth. We're up 15. If they go on a 12-0 run for the rest of the game, if we don't score another basket, we still win by three. Defensively we just have to be more in tune and not allow a great team, a great offensive team to get as many great looks as they did down the stretch. Jason Kidd had an open three. Jason Terry had a leak-out lay-up. He also had a corner jumper. Dirk 90/90 he hit a wide-open three. That's not our defense at all. We have to do a better job and be more in tune.",
        "4": "It's a different mindset, of course. It's a ballgame now. With the series tied 1-1, we're looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be a difficult challenge for us but we're looking forward to it. We're a confident bunch. We play great on the road. It's going to be a hostile environment. Their fans and team are going to bring everything they have. We have to come out with it all. Play as close to 48 minutes as possible on both ends.",
        "6": "It's not going to affect us for Game 3. It hurts right now because it's right now. We're competitors. We want to win the game. We feel like we have a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, that our defense will prevail. That's how much confidence we have in our defense. It hurts now, but we'll be fine. I don't feel like our confidence will be down going into Game 3. We'll be back to square one and figure out how to win the game.",
        "8": "No, I don't think it's an issue.",
        "11": "We were asked about it after Game 1, I said it would be a non-issue. He's a great scorer. He understands he can use both hands. He got the left-hand lay-up to tie the game up at 90, and then the game-winner going left once again. So as you can tell, it has no effect on his left hand at all, if any.",
        "13": "They did. They did a great job of playing two on the ball. They used Tyson Chandler to come off pick-and-rolls, Tyson Chandler or Dirk. They blitzed me and D-Wade's pick-and-roll. Something different. Something we can go to the film to figure out how to exploit that or do a better job of executing later in the game. They didn't do that till the fourth quarter. They picked up the aggression and it got us out of the flow of the offense where we were taking shots at the end of the shot clock. I know I took a few fadeaway threes at the end of the shot clock because we couldn't get into our offense. It's something we'll work on and be better on in Game 3. THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, you guys are now 6-0 I think when trailing at halftime in these playoffs. You've shown a great knack to come back and win games. Is there a concern of you getting awfully comfortable that, oh, when the fourth quarter comes we'll come back anyway? Is that something you like not have to do?",
        "1": "LeBron, after the Chicago game, you said that you would not failure team again. What has been the difference late in games and why have you guys, not just you but as a team, been able to close out these games?",
        "2": "LeBron, every time you guys have been up in this series, Spo has pretty much stayed with the script, we move on, it's one game. He says all those things. What have you guys learned throughout the playoff run about how important it is to move on that quickly?",
        "3": "What makes Pat Riley cool?",
        "4": "What makes him cool, Pat Riley?",
        "5": "I was wondering in your opinion, what makes him cool? Do you think he's cool?",
        "6": "Can you describe that moment in Cleveland when he came up and pitched you up there. What was that like?",
        "7": "Did it get you fired up?",
        "8": "LeBron, your three-point shooting obviously has just improved throughout the playoffs. How important is that shot at the end of Game 4 in regulation in Boston? It seemed the next game you hit five and since then you've been on a tear. How critical was that shot to your confidence, if it was at all?",
        "9": "Two questions: First of all, did Riles dump his championship rings on table when you met?",
        "10": "How many?",
        "11": "The other one is that you were just saying, you were outside most of Game 1. I think you got three makes in the lane. Was that because they were sitting there watching you or a lot of help or were you just reading the situation?",
        "12": "Several of the Mavericks players last night were talking about they weren't really able to get into their flow of offense. They started running a lot more sets. How much of that was because they weren't rebounding well? How much is what you were doing with your perimeter defense? And just in general, what you want to do with Jason Kidd to keep him from getting into that flow of offense?",
        "13": "You mentioned you, Chris and Dwyane figuring out how to close games. What's allowed you specifically to do so much of it in the final five minutes in the final moments of the game?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's not like we have big deficits at halftime. I seen the stats last night, down two points to Chicago, three points here, two points to Boston, one point to Boston. It's not like it's a huge deficit that we're trying to come back from 12 or 14 points down. Usually it's just good basketball at this point in time. We happened to be down. We've played I think -- if I'm doing my math right, we've played 16 games. So we have had ten other games we wasn't trailing. We just got to continue to play our game and not worry about if we're trailing or not. We don't want to trail. We don't want to trail at all throughout the whole game, if it's possible. But we just got to maintain our focus.",
        "1": "Like I said, it comes from failure throughout the season. Having games where we felt like we could or should have won games late in games and we just didn't execute. I said last night I was used to closing out games in the last seven years. CB was used to closing out games and D-Wade was used to closing out games. One thing was figuring out how to do it together. We were used to doing it individually early on in the season. Me making a play or CB making a play or D-Wade making a play going back to our last few years. Once we figured out how we were going to do it together for the better of the team, we started to close games out, figure things out, figure out certain sets that would work for us in late-game situations and go from there.",
        "2": "That's what it's about. We understand that Game 1 is over. We played well, but there were some things we could have done better. We now move our focus to Game 2 and approach that game like it's our last as well. We continue to come into our home court and try to protect home court. We understand Dallas if comes in here and does a great job of stealing one of our games, then they feel -- they forget about Game 1 as well. So we have to come in with the same mindset.",
        "3": "Huh?",
        "4": "What do you mean \"cool\"?",
        "5": "He cool. There you go.",
        "6": "It was great. I had an unbelievable meeting with not only Pat but Micky and Nick Arison and Coach Spo and Zo came. It was a great meeting. Basically gave me the blueprint about how this organization is ran, both on the court and off the court. The great thing I got out of that is about how important family is. I'm a big believer in that. Always have been throughout my life. I appreciate that, and also the product they can put on the floor as well. With D-Wade and also at the time they were talking about they could get CB as well and another free agent. I thought it was the right move.",
        "7": "No, not at that point. I definitely seen something at that point when we were all talking about the players in this organization, I definitely have something to look forward to.",
        "8": "I think it was just a big shot, period. It was a close game at that point in The Garden. To be able to make that shot and tie the game up, it was a huge shot. It definitely was a shot that we needed at the time, and I was able to knock it down. And I just kind of just took that momentum from that game, and moved on to Game 5. Now I'm here, made a big shot in Game 2 in Chicago and a few key shots in Game 5 also in Chicago from behind the arc. And then last night I was able to make a few, also. It's not my game, though. I'm not a three-point shooter. I'm an attack guy. If a defense is going to allow me to sit and measure up a three-pointer, I'm going to take it. I have that much confidence in my shooting ability. I'm an attack-first guy. That's what I'm best at. I don't care how many threes I make, I understand that my game is in the paint.",
        "9": "Yes.",
        "10": "It was a bunch of them. I don't know.",
        "11": "I guess reading the situation. Taking what the defense gives me. They played a lot of zone. So in the zone it is to keep your perimeter attackers out on the perimeter. I was able to make a couple just swing, swing situations where the defender ran at D-Wade or ran at Mike Bibby and I was sitting in the corner by myself and I was able to hit a couple. I made a couple off the dribble. One at the end of the third and one right before the end of the third. I think like a minute on the clock I was able to pull up for a three. Just try to take what the defense gives me, and not force anything against this defense. They play so many styles, from man to zone to matchup and things like that. You have to kind of be patient and go with it.",
        "12": "Just play our defense. This is the most challenging offense we've played in this postseason, because of the firepower that they have offensively. They have multiple guys that can shoot, multiple guys that can put the ball on the floor and create for others. They have guys in the paint that also can create in Shawn Marion and Tyson Chandler, who gets into the paint, and makes some things happen around the rim. It's a challenge for all of us. We come out with a game plan, Coach Spo and the coaching staff gives us a game plan and we go from there. Kind of just use our instincts, our athleticism and our communication defensively to try to read and react.",
        "13": "Just seizing the moment. Understanding this is a great opportunity for not only myself but for our team to seize the moment and try to take full advantage of it. Am I going to make every shot or close every game out from now on? I hope so. I don't know. But I do put myself in the position, I do have the confidence that if I have the ball in my hands or if I get the ball in my hands that I can make a play, not only for myself but for my teammates to help us win that game. We're a really good team down the stretch now. It has a lot to do with our team as far as trust, it has a lot to do with myself and D-Wade and just the position Coach has put us in in late games to have us have an ability to come down the stretch and make shots for our team. I guess it's a confidence of closing games out, but it's also the trust you have for your teammates. When they look at you and see you need to close a game out. No matter if you fail, they look for you again to do it again. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

      "questions": {
        "3": "LeBron, in the Chicago series Erik said you asked to be on Rose in the fourth quarter. Was that the same case tonight with Terry?",
        "4": "LeBron, you guys fell behind by eight early in the third. You called a timeout and they only scored a few points in the next three and a half minutes. What changed defensively?",
        "6": "LeBron, what goes through your mind as you go into these fourth quarters of games, especially these key games?",
        "7": "Your first Finals victory, how much different does this one feel? Obviously you guys still have a lot of work left to do? How does this feel from 2007 when you were frustrated for four games?",
        "8": "38% overall, 45% from three, what were they giving you guys?",
        "9": "LeBron, with the rhythm you seem to be in on the threes lately, is the idea you can be defended by making you shoot, like San Antonio did a couple of years ago, is that gone forever now?",
        "11": "You know, if a player has been in the Super Bowl before, even if he's the backup fullback on a team, you might tell the quarterback it's a little different. We've been in a big game. We're experienced. I want to know did Dwyane or even Udonis tell you, LeBron, anything about this being The Finals and it being different? Or was that left unsaid?",
        "12": "For each one of you guys, Dirk said he tore the tendon in the middle finger of his left hand. How do you think it's going to affect the series?",
        "13": "Dirk."
      },
      "answers": {
        "3": "No, I mean whatever. Whatever it takes for our team. You know, if I need to be on Terry or anyone on their team, I try to take the challenge. Our defense is pretty good. It's never me just guarding someone individually. But I do take the challenge on any individual matchup that I'm against. And tonight happened to be Terry mostly in the second half.",
        "4": "We needed to lock in. We came out in the third quarter not paying attention to detail. Gave them an open three. DeShawn Stevenson hit an open three. Dirk hit an open shot at the top of the key. We just weren't paying attention to detail about how we were going to defend this team coming into the game. Once we slowed down and got back into what we know, what our strong point is, and that's getting stops, we were able to get out, D-Wade was able to get an and-one. Make another shot and we made a run.",
        "6": "Defense. I think in order for us to win basketball games, we have to defend and we have to get stops, and our offense will speak for itself when we continue to get stops. I think for me going into the fourth quarter, I know it's winning time. That's when the game is won. So I got to try to dominate my individual matchup defensively, and then try to execute as best as possible. Try to get good looks, not turn the ball over. And we did a good job of doing that tonight. We got stops and we executed on the offensive end.",
        "7": "D-Wade said that to me. Congratulated me after the game on my first Finals victory. I mean, it feels good because it's the first game. And we played well as a team. We got a lot of work to do. We'll come in with the same mindset on Thursday, and looking forward to this challenge once again that's in front of us. It's one in the books. We're excited about this game. Tomorrow we prepare for Game 2, and obviously there's ways we can get better.",
        "8": "They play a lot of zone, and the zone is to pack the paint, keep our drivers out of the paint, myself and D-Wade. And dare us to shoot threes. I think our bench came in and did a great job, Rio (Chalmers), Mike Miller did a great job against that zone, knocking shots down. We needed that boost off the bench. We know how strong their bench is, and our bench matched them tonight. And they played extremely well. When they were in the zone, they knocked down shots. Rio gave us a big boost. Mike Miller gave us a big boost, and everyone contributed.",
        "9": "Pretty much. Yeah, dare me to shoot, that's pretty much gone. I think people will still live with keeping myself and keeping D-Wade on the perimeter, but it's just my confidence. I put a lot of hard work into it, and understanding that you got to be a two-way player in this league. You have to be able to shoot the ball, you have to be able to drive and do other things to not only get yourself involved, but get your teammates involved. Tonight once again I shot the ball extremely well from the outside, but more importantly, it helped our team get a win. That's what it's all about.",
        "11": "I think it was left unsaid. They understand I've been in some big games. I've been in the Finals. Didn't win a ballgame in '07, but I've been in big games before. So basically it's the same conversation we had before every game. Let's get ready to go out and continue to improve as a team, as individuals, and help lead this team to a victory.",
        "12": "Who?",
        "13": "He's right-handed. He'll be all right."

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, question in two parts if you don't mind. What was it like to be on the court with all The Finals logos and signage? Does it seem real now? And secondly, I'm curious if in your shoot for those promotional shoots for ABC, did you look at the trophy, hold it, anything like that game?",
        "1": "Did you hold it?",
        "2": "Considering all the ups and downs that you guys have been through this year, what's the feeling of the satisfaction of being here at this moment, being so close?",
        "3": "LeBron, a couple of your teammates out there were saying you're the best player in the league who doesn't have a ring yet. Other guys were arguing a guy like Jason Kidd with all the overall longevity and his stats. Is it just talent or overall body of work when you make that argument?",
        "4": "Do you feel any differently going into this Finals versus taking Cleveland into the Spurs Finals in terms of the chances and what you think you're able to accomplish?",
        "5": "LeBron, do you still feel that this team is regarded as villains around the country? Or do you think the beautiful way you guys have played basketball is maybe starting to change it a little bit? Where do you think --",
        "6": "LeBron, when you look at Dirk's career, his accomplishments, 13 years of greatness, but no championship. You're obviously trying to fill that space on your resume. What does it detract from a player's accomplishment if he doesn't get that championship?",
        "7": "LeBron, when you lose a Finals, what kind of psychological impact does that have going forward throughout your career?",
        "8": "For you personally.",
        "9": "Are you looking forward to guarding Dirk?",
        "10": "Do you think he's in the top ten of all time like Carlisle says?",
        "11": "Top ten players of all time.",
        "12": "LeBron, did people misread this whole episode with you coming to the Heat and everything? Was it more about the friendship with Wade and the two of you feeling like you can win a championship anywhere if you play together?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "First of all, I'm honored to be here again. Now with this franchise, it's an honor. As a player we worked hard. I worked hard individually to get to this point. I had a lot of visions of being at this moment and the now it's hit me. Being on the floor and seeing the championship logos, The Finals logos, I'm very excited. I got an opportunity to see the trophy yesterday and take pictures with it. Hopefully we can bring it home.",
        "1": "Yes. They make you do everything with it. Besides take it home.",
        "2": "I mean, it's great satisfaction to be here. But we have a lot of work to do still. It's been a great ride so far throughout this postseason. We played some great teams starting with Philadelphia, then going with Boston and then Chicago. Three great teams. And being able to be in this moment, we've all had a vision where we all worked hard, from the start of training camp on the Air Force base. And to be here is very humbling, it's very satisfying at this point. We want more.",
        "3": "I don't know. That's something for you guys to break down and look at the numbers and the everything. I'm hungry for one. That was my goal coming into this league. It's been my goal. I've seen the vision over the last few years. I haven't had an opportunity to get there. I played in The Finals before; didn't win it. I got to the Eastern Conference Finals before against Orlando; lost. Had some years where we were the best team in the league in Cleveland and we didn't get back to that point. I have had this vision and now I'm back here and I'm looking to change the outcome.",
        "4": "I feel different because I'm older, more experienced. I'm a better player at this point. You know, going into the Finals with the Spurs, I said it at the end of that Finals, I said they were a better team than us. It would have been a lot harder to digest it if we had came into a Finals with a team that we felt like wasn't better than us, didn't execute better than us, wasn't a veteran club and would have beat us. I thought the Spurs were a better team than us and took advantage of all our weaknesses. They've been to that position before. Right now I feel more comfortable because I feel like we have a veteran ballclub and we have three guys that have had rings, Eddie House and D-Wade and Udonis. We have guys that have been in the postseason year after year after year. When you have that experience, when you have guys that can make plays and take over games, you like your chances.",
        "5": "We don't know. We don't really get into it too much. You know, we've got a lot of flack this year over mostly because of myself. And we've tried to use that as motivation every day we get on the basketball court. But just play the game of basketball. That's all we can do is play the game of basketball at a high level. Play Miami Heat basketball. That's defending at a high level with speed and athleticism. And then sharing the ball and being the team offensively. As far as this villain thing and things like that, we don't -- it is what it is. People are going to say whatever they want about us. We just got to continue to go out there and just play our game.",
        "6": "You hear it all the time. Always say, to go down as one of the greats, you have to put a ring on your resume. I mean, as an individual, you have those dreams and you have those goals. You want to be a champion. Do you care as much as what people say about your career as far as your body of work? I don't know. I think you look at Dirk's numbers, they speak for itself over his 13-year career. You look at my numbers so far in my eight-year career, you know, it kind of speaks for itself as well. As individuals, myself and Dirk, we both are competitors, and we both know the ultimate feeling is to win, is to win a championship. Not for whatever everybody else think, but for the people we have around us. That's our teammates, our organization, our families to be able to have that moment and have that feeling.",
        "7": "Well, I mean, it all depends what type of guy you are.",
        "8": "For me personally it's driven me. It's gotten me better. I go back and look at some of those games, I look at myself and say, you are a much better player than you were then. That comes from playing games, playing postseason games, losing, winning. But I took from that Finals that I just need to become better, not only as a basketball player, but as a leader on and off the court. Just use it as fuel. Is it going to happen the next year? It can happen to you individually where you become a better player. But does it always get you back to the Finals? It doesn't. There's a lot of guys that have been in The Finals, and lost and never got back. You look at Allen Iverson who got to the Finals and took the 76ers to The Finals. He was great every year, every year after that, but he was never able to get back. I'm humbled. I'm blessed that I'm able to get back to this point and to be able to redeem myself for that time when I was in The Finals against the Spurs.",
        "9": "I'm looking forward to guarding anybody. I don't care about guarding anybody. I mean, that's what I do. I'm a defensive guy. I'm not sitting up here and saying I can stop Dirk. I don't think no one can single handedly stop Dirk. He's a shot maker. One of the best shot makers we've ever had in this league. Whoever Coach puts me on or whoever I need to take the challenge on, it doesn't matter to me.",
        "10": "As far as what?",
        "11": "I don't know. Dirk is a great player. There are a lot of great players that have played in this league. Dirk is one heck of a player. The things that he's able to do out on the floor, the shot-making ability, everyone said, you forced me to a bad shot. Really it's not a comfort shot for him. It looks like a bad shot if you don't know basketball or you don't know his game. One-legged fadeaways off the glass and pull-up jumpers off the dribble, pump fake, pump fake, fadeaway, things like that. He's a great player.",
        "12": "Ultimately for me it was about being in the position to compete year after year after year. And not only being able to do that, but being able to do it with one of my best friends, one of the best players we have in this league today in Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. I know what this league is all about, about having multiple guys on the court that can dominate a game. With teaming up with these guys I feel like we can compete for a lot of years to come. We've proven a lot of people wrong so far. We have a lot of work to do still. Ultimately that's what it's about. Me being happy and also being able to compete at the highest level. That's what there league is about. This league is about. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "2": "At any point in the last couple of minutes of the game did you guys notice the Bulls' body language changed at all? Like they were playing more to not to lose rather than to win?",
        "3": "LeBron, drawing on your own personal experiences in these situations, how did that help you and how can that help Derrick going through these kind of tough series in the playoffs carrying a team like this?",
        "4": "LeBron, at what point did you refine yourself late in the games or was it a feel you had in the postseason?",
        "6": "LeBron and Dwyane, just being at this point, after what happened last summer with all the expectations, how does it feel? What's it like? Is it a sense of relief? Or how would you describe it right now?",
        "7": "LeBron, your three-point shooting has improved over the years. For what you've done in the last minutes of the last couple of rounds, is it just something you've grown into? Or did you feel like you were really shooting it well coming into the playoffs, that and your free-throw shooting?",
        "8": "Is it something technical?",
        "9": "LeBron, when you see this surge in interest, year-long interest, since you went to Miami, so much of it, whether people are hating or loving you, it has to do a lot with you, how do you feel about that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "2": "No, we've just seen our body language change. Me and D-Wade said we want to watch the last four minutes of the game and see exactly what happened. We don't honestly know what happened. We know some big plays happened, and we know we won the game. It went so fast. Our body language changed, once we got stops and finally made a few shots. I have to give a lot of credit to Chicago, Coach Thibs, D-Rose and the rest of those guys. That defense we faced this round is tremendous. Like I said, coming -- I said it coming into this series, this was going to be an offensive struggle for both teams. That's exactly what it was. We both, Chicago and us, we both pride on the defensive end. You know, once we made a few shots, we felt like we could get stops in the fourth quarter. That's what we build on. We build on getting fourth quarter stops. D-Wade made some unbelievable plays. Got an and-one on transition on D-Rose. Got a four-point play. I was able to make a few shots and we continued to get stops.",
        "3": "It's going to help you. I've been in situations where I say why me at this point? But you have to keep working and be put in those positions time after time after time where if you fail, you have to be ready to take that challenge again and again and again. When you're a leader, D-Rose -- he earned the MVP. He's a great talent, unbelievable player. Chicago got a great -- not only a great basketball player, but a great kid, too. What he's done for this city and what he's done for this franchise in just three years is remarkable. The sky is the limit for that guy. I mean, wow, as a fan, he's going to get better and better. Hopefully we don't have to continue to see him in the postseason. DWYANE WADE: We will. LeBRON JAMES: Yeah, we will.",
        "4": "It's not refine, it's just being put in those positions. I never lost confidence in my ability. I know what I'm capable of. My teammates never lost confidence in me either. That's the huge thing. When your teammates continue to look at you down the stretch and say, we need you to bring this game home for us, we need you to make plays offensively and defensively, you never lose confidence in yourself, too. This postseason has been a good run for myself as far as being able to close games. But I've done it in the past. It's just the thing when you fail in late-game situations, those are the ones that people remember. They don't even remember the ones when you do well. I just got to keep being put in those situations, like I said, and not be afraid to fail.",
        "6": "It's no sense of relief right now. We still have work to do. Like I said, we will look at this moment tonight, have a little bit of time tomorrow to go over this moment, what we just accomplished, but we get ready for Dallas very soon. We don't take for granted this win and take for granted being the Eastern Conference champs. We're not going to take that for granted. There's a lot of teams, 15 teams in the Eastern Conference that set out to do the same thing starting the season. But we have a lot of work to do still. We look forward to the challenge once the Finals begin on Tuesday.",
        "7": "I guess it's work, first of all. Putting the extra hours of work. Me and D-Wade always, for the most part, we stay after, get shots. Late-night get shots. Just trying to work on our craft to get better for our teammates. Not only for ourselves, but for our teammates to come through in situations like that. When you have confidence in your ability to go out there and perform, that helps. Being put in those positions help. Like I said before, when you have the confidence from your teammates to take those shots, or even when you miss, they still look at you like we want you to take those shots again. We have that confidence coming from the other 13 guys in our locker room. For myself, just stepping up. Just stepping up for this team and trying to do whatever it takes to win. And if that's making a big shot late in the game or if that's trying to get a defensive stop, I try to take the challenge.",
        "8": "Nothing technical. Just repetition.",
        "9": "I understand a lot of the backlash that came with me going to Miami, but I understand also that I did what was best for me, what was best for my family and what was best for me being a professional athlete. I understand what this league is all about. I wanted to team up with some guys that I understood that would never die down in the moment. The opportunity presented itself with this great organization, and D-Wade came to me and said it was possible. We made it happen. You know, I'm happy. In anyone's job, they always try to find some way they can do their job and be happy doing it. And that's where I am right now in my life, as far as on the court and off the court. I just keep on -- I'm trying to get better every day. Not only as a basketball player, but as a father, as a friend. All the above, I guess."

        "0": "What does it feel like to be just on the verge?",
        "1": "How inspiring has Mike Miller been, with everything he's going through in his life right now, how he came out last night and probably had his best game as a member of the Miami Heat?",
        "2": "What did you think about Mike Brown going to the Lakers and getting back on the bench?",
        "3": "There's a perception that they did it for you so you could pick the next coach?",
        "4": "That the Cavs fired Mike (Indiscernible) I know it's not true.",
        "5": "But what did you think when that came out and people were thinking you were the reason?",
        "6": "Mike has said you guys kept a relationship.",
        "7": "What do you think -- how was your relationship?",
        "8": "LeBron, you guys were particularly emotional after the game in a nice way. You and Dwyane had a really nice hug, that kind of thing. Was that because you knew what that win meant? Why were you kind of feeling so great?",
        "9": "I just meant that how much is that about knowing what being one win away from the Finals is, 96% of the teams that have gotten up 3-1 --",
        "10": "Do you respect getting there more now than say when you got there the first time so quick?",
        "11": "LeBron, you impacted two -- well, the whole game, but two particular points. I wonder if you would review them for us. First of all, the period at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter when you were setting up on the guys while you were scoring, plus obviously the way you played defensively at the end?",
        "12": "LeBron, you talked about the process. How much easier does the process become once you have those five guys on the court at the end of the game?",
        "13": "Even though you're up 3-1, you still have the mindset of being the more desperate team tomorrow?",
        "14": "If you guys are able to get this next win, do you feel, after everything, that would provide at least a small measure of validation? Or does it have to be all or nothing?",
        "15": "LeBron, you guys seem to have improved every step of the playoffs. It's beyond Udonis and Mike Miller, the defense and everything. Why? Why is this team getting so much better in the playoffs do you think?",
        "16": "How bitter was your Finals?",
        "17": "But that was the pinnacle? The Finals is the pinnacle.",
        "18": "You talked about the things that drive you, motivation and fuel and all those things. Does something four years ago, like that Finals, is that something --",
        "19": "LeBron when you look at how you guys closed out the game, you hit your last 24 free-throws, were you aware of that? Did you have a confidence when your teammates went to the line? Did you know you were in such a streak?",
        "20": "You said Mike is a really good coach. What specifically about him stands out?",
        "21": "Did you get any texts from L.A. about him?",
        "22": "Based on what you said last night, given a choice, would you rather make the game-winning shot or block the potential game-winning shot?",
        "23": "I wanted to ask you this. Mike Miller told us when he hit that shot in the fourth quarter that he thought about his baby, who is in ICU. How often during the course of basketball do you think about the things that really matter in life?",
        "24": "How much of a change is it for you when you have to bring the ball up, when it's you three with UD and --",
        "25": "It doesn't expend any more energy from you?",
        "26": "Obviously."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We're just seizing the moment, honestly. You know we got one game to close them out. We've been in this position twice this year, and we've done a great job doing it. Different circumstances being on the road, but we look forward to the challenge.",
        "1": "You know, it's been great. Last night was great. It was what we had expected of him. We were happy for him last night to come out and play his best game in probably the biggest game of our season. So he did a great job.",
        "2": "I think it's great. I tweeted a long while ago about seeing him -- he was in the studio doing the game. I said he looks a lot better patrolling the sidelines. So I think he'll be great. He's a great coach.",
        "3": "Did what for me?",
        "4": "No.",
        "5": "Mike Brown is a great coach. He brought us -- he gave us a success we hadn't had before in that city, and it started with his defensive concepts. He brought in a defensive mindset that we didn't have. 50-plus wins, he was coach of the year, got us to the Finals, won the Eastern Conference Finals. We was competitive year after year because of him and his coaching staff. I respect him and am grateful to have had him as a coach throughout the years that I had him. He definitely helped me become who I am today.",
        "6": "Yes.",
        "7": "It was great. When you look back on it, you always say you probably take things for granted, when you look back on it. I look at it, we could have been better. But I think we had a -- man, we had an unbelievable relationship. Like I said, I knew his family. I respected him as a coach. Him being a young coach when he first got to Cleveland and growing those five years. Great time. If it's true, when it's official, I think the Lakers got them a great coach.",
        "8": "First of all, we love to play the game. If you don't have emotions about this game in this stage, I think it's a problem with you. We always do that. You look at all our wins or all our games when we fight hard to come back in a game or we just feel like it took a lot of energy out of us, we always embrace one another after the game. That's something we do as a team. People have given us a knock over that, which is crazy, but we don't stop that for nobody.",
        "9": "It's just about embracing that moment, understanding how big that game was last night. And to use extra innings to get that win, it meant a lot.",
        "10": "Absolutely. It's tough. I don't remember it being this tough in '07 when I got there, but it's tough. It's been a long road. We are one win away.",
        "11": "We missed a lot of lay-ups to start the game. We missed a dunk. D-Wade had a wide-open dunk to put us up 6-0, he missed that dunk. I missed a few lay-ups. We didn't have it going offensively. But one thing we did, we defended that quarter. Gave up 19 points. I felt like I had a -- I feel like I had a good rhythm. Just tried to keep us in the game, either assisting or scoring all those points in the first quarter, and then late in the game defensively trying to take the challenge on Derrick Rose. He's a great player. I feel like I'm a pretty good solid defender. I just wanted to try to make it tough on him, and make it tough on the team.",
        "12": "That's -- nothing from our season has been easy at all. That is not even in our vocabulary or in our pre-game speech or anything. Nothing is easy. We work for everything. We come in and prepare ourselves every day to get ready for a game. So we're just looking forward to it.",
        "13": "That's the only way we play. When we play like that, we're a great team. We're desperate. We want to win and we want to close out on their floor. We're looking forward to the challenge. We know it's going to be tough. They have some of the best fans in the world. So we'll see.",
        "14": "No, we've played so much basketball right now, we feel like -- we are trying to compete for a championship. Tomorrow is our next step. Is a win guaranteed tomorrow? No, none of us knows that right now. We're going to come out with the same intensity we've got since after Game 1, and we know we'll give ourselves a great chance to win.",
        "15": "Just trying to seize the moment and understand these opportunities don't present themselves every year. Me and D-Wade talk about it all the time. If you would have told us wouldn't have an opportunity to be close to the Finals in five or six years, we would have thought you was lying to us. It's been '06, and '07 for myself. I'm just trying to seize the moment. I understanding what type of team we have. Understanding we have a good enough shot. We don't want to waste the opportunity.",
        "16": "How bitter? I got swept. I didn't win a game. It was very bitter. Every time I got knocked out of the playoffs it was bitter. Losing the Eastern Conference Finals to Orlando. Second round to Boston last year. Second round to Boston the year before in Game 7. It was all bitter times, man. I'm a competitor. I want to win.",
        "17": "Yeah, but if you lose, if you're a competitor, the Finals -- you're trying to -- you lose four games in the Finals and you lose a Game 7, that's kind of similar, to myself. After that Game 3, the confidence was -- we didn't have much confidence coming to Game 4. They were a better team. I said it after that series. They were the better team. San Antonio was the better team. We learned from that. When you get to Game 7 against Boston, who eventually won the title, and we had -- it was one or two possessions we could have stole that game, I was hurting too.",
        "18": "Absolutely. I think about it all the time. I even go back and watch some of those games and see how I wasn't that good of a player, especially on both ends of the floor. You just try to use those moments. There's no way I should be on the floor on a team that I can't win a game in a series. You use that as motivation. You go in the next year and you are playing some great basketball, probably the favorite, and then you lose the Eastern Conference Finals to Orlando where a ball here, a bounce here, a bounce there, and then you win it. And then seeing Boston two years in a row, where you get to Game 7 on their floor and you have an opportunity to win, and then last year, having an opportunity, being up 2-1 in the series, and losing that series. I got a lot of motivation. There's nothing I'm trying to go out and seek. But I've been in situations where I haven't succeeded, and trying to change it.",
        "19": "I was aware we missed four in a row in the fourth quarter. I was aware of that. We did a good job of being focused. When we get up to the free-throw line, those are the times where you don't have to play against their defense. You don't have to play against Chicago's defense when you're shooting free-throws. You have to try to maximize that opportunity. And we did it.",
        "20": "I think his drive, man. He coaches as if he was on the court and he wanted to play. He loves -- helped us get better every single day. We never wasted an opportunity to get better. It showed. Ultimately, we didn't win a championship, which we wanted to do in Cleveland. I know he wanted it bad. I wanted it. We didn't win. We got better every single day. We brought the fans in Cleveland what they hadn't seen before.",
        "21": "No. Do you think L.A. texts me?",
        "22": "I mean, both of them are gratifying, honestly. Me being a defensive guy, I would rather have the defensive shot block. I have had a few in my career where I blocked a shot to end the game and we won the game or had to close out on free-throws. It's gratifying. I have had a game-winning shot at the buzzer. Both of them are fun.",
        "23": "You think about them all the time. Your family is a big part of what you do every day. When you're out on the court, you think about it. You don't want to let them down. You don't want to let your kids down, when you go home and those are the ones smiling and saying what happened, dad? Why did you miss that dunk? Why did you miss that play? Why did you turn the ball over? You want to be great for them. Knowing Mike's situation, I think it was definitely a relief for him to play the way he played last night, thinking about his daughter at the same time.",
        "24": "Not much of a change. It's something I did all year. It's something I've done over my career, being a point forward. It's not a big change at all.",
        "25": "I'm in great condition, man.",

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, in the overtime, there was that play, you were fighting Noah for the rebound. You had to hit the deck to get it, saved it to Haslem, he hit the deck. Describe that play from your vantage point and describe it. You had been playing 45, 48 minutes to that point. How much did you have left?",
        "1": "I got two questions for both of us guys: What did you think of Derrick Rose' two dunks? And what's it like, you're out there, it's a really tough defensive game, and all of a sudden guys are making really spectacular plays and the level of play just seems like it's going up?",
        "4": "LeBron, can you talk about defending Derrick on the last play of regulation and just defending him in general for the last quarter and overtime.",
        "5": "Do you think as you guys advance, defense is what's pushing you through these playoffs and may give you a championship?",
        "7": "For both of you: After the layoff you each had from being in The Finals, what does it mean for you to be this close now and what kind of focus is needed?",
        "8": "Kind of an off-the-beaten-path question for you, Drake was in the front row going nuts every time you made a shot. Just talk about his importance as a friendship you have.",
        "10": "LeBron, when Mike Miller was making his decision this offseason, I know obviously you have a relationship with him, was tonight, in terms of aggressiveness and everything he did, more what you envisioned for him? I know he's had a tough year with the injuries and everything else he's had to deal with."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "First you missed the block on that play. D-Wade coming weak side and getting that block. It's whatever it takes at that point. Joakim got a hand on it. I wanted to try to fight him as much as possible. I was able to strip the ball away from him. Dove on the ball. The ball was headed out of bounds. Once I tipped it and I saw it rolling and I saw UD, I already knew we had the ball. Nobody is going to take the ball from him. That was just a great all-around team possession for us. It came at a big moment in the game in overtime.",
        "1": "First of all, the two dunks were great. There's no point guard in our league I think -- besides, you have Russell Westbrook, he makes plays like that. But D-Rose on the break, he goes to a jump-stop and finish it with an and-one and then he breaks down our defense, split pick-and-roll and he gets in there against probably our best shot-blocker in Joel Anthony, and dunks the ball for an and-one. He's a special player. Those plays are spectacular. That's why he is who he is. What was the second question?",
        "4": "With a player like that, you just try to keep him out of the paint as best as you can. He was attacking our defense a lot, getting to the free-throw line. The last shot all you could do is contest. There's not too many guys that are going to block his shot on the jumpshot. But I just tried to make it hard on him, get the contest. I made him take a tough one. As far as guarding him throughout the game, I take pride defensively. It doesn't matter who it is, if it's Derrick Rose or starting off on Luol, it's whatever it takes for myself and for our team. If that means me playing extensive minutes guarding D-Rose, then I'll do it. I don't have a problem with that. I play both sides of the floor. I love defense much more than I do offensively. I just take pride on that side of the floor. We were able to get enough stops. It's great when you have guys behind you that also love to play defense, also. So you know you got help if you get beat. I got beat on the baseline, D-Wade got the spectacular block. So you take pride on that side of the floor and it pays off for you.",
        "5": "Defense is our staple. We know in order for us to win basketball games we have to get stops and we have to play at a high level. That's all we're about. We know offensively -- at times we have rough stretches where we don't score, but we give ourselves a great chance to win every game because we defend. And that's what it's about.",
        "7": "I mean, we're looking at a Game 5 as a must-win. We're going to every game saying it's a must-win for us. We take it upon that challenge, going back into the madhouse. We know it's going to be extremely loud. They're going to feed off their fans. We're going to try to play as desperate as we've played the last three games. It's been since '06 for D-Wade, '07 for myself since we've been to The Finals and it's one game away. We're not taking anything for granted. We're just continuing to play our game and take one game at a time. It starts with Game 5.",
        "8": "We have a family bond. Drake has always been supportive of myself, and everything that he do I'm a supporter of his. So it goes beyond what you guys see at the game. We talk on a regular -- everything, about family and everything. What we have is a real family. It's not just because we are successful what we do. We really care about one another on a day-to-day basis. Anytime you get a friend that can come and support you in what you do, I really respect that. He has a busy schedule. I respect that. Anytime I get some free time, I try to come and support him as well.",
        "10": "Absolutely. Tonight he just played free. Everything that he gave us tonight was what we always expected out of him. He didn't think about it tonight. Every time he caught the ball -- what we've been telling him all year, \"when you catch the ball, just shoot it.\" He's probably the only guy on our team that can shoot any shot he wants to. Even me, D-Wade and CB, Coach gets on us sometimes if we take ill-advised shots and things like that. Mike Miller is a guy who can shoot any shot he wants. Tonight he did that. He caught the ball, he shot threes, made a pull-up, and then what he's always been doing when he gets minutes, he rebounds the ball extremely well. He had nine rebounds for us and they were all key. Like I said before, that lineup we talked about this summer, myself and D-Wade and CB, Udonis and Mike is something we always envisioned, and it's coming together at the right time."

      "questions": {
        "0": "LeBron, is it possible for them -- obviously they lost the home court in Game 2. They obviously don't want to go back 3-1. Do you expect even more desperation? Does that even exist?",
        "5": "Is that the best defense collectively you guys have played during the season so far this year?",
        "6": "LeBron, to be able to finish games the way you are, does it help that you have other guys like Chris and Dwyane, who maybe you don't have to push hard for all 44 of your minutes so there is a little more left? And have you felt a little more left in your tank because of the supporting cast and the guys you have that you can do this more often at the end?",
        "7": "At the same time, are you guys surprised that Derrick has not taken over in the fourth like he usually has been? Or is that a credit to you guys' defense?",
        "8": "You draw comparisons to Magic Johnson the way you played last night. Do you like playing that style?",
        "9": "(Indiscernible) Obviously you get that offense -- how much does the same ring true with those first six, eight minutes, a lot of deflections, blocking a lot of shots, is there such thing as defensive --",
        "12": "Should the benches, in the time-outs and locker room, be almost segregated? Is it fair for you guys to have microphones that anytime you come off the floor, that anything you say could be picked up in the course of the game?",
        "13": "Was last night's aggressiveness (Indiscernible) what you expected?",
        "14": "During this series there was talk comparing these teams to your past teams offensively, just from the standpoint how much they rely on Rose and how much your teams relied on you. Is that a valid comparison? Is that what happened in games 2 and 3, you guys shut down Derrick?",
        "15": "You were limping a little bit after you went into the crowd --",
        "16": "Did you have any after-effects after --",
        "21": "(Indiscernible)?",
        "22": "The screaming impression, any players do it? Anybody on the team do an impression of him?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We're playing desperate too. Both teams have been playing hard. We're just as desperate as they is to win another game at home.",
        "5": "I mean, two or three games, I would say. We just bring it to them with a game plan. Guys are finally understanding how important every possession is. This being the semifinals. We were playing great defense in the Boston series at times and the Philly series at times. But I think these games consistently, this is the best we've played. We have to keep it going.",
        "6": "No, I do push hard all my 44 minutes. I don't go out there and dog any of my time on the floor. But I think it's the luxury of having guys that can make plays besides myself. D-Wade can make plays, CB can make plays. Udonis made plays for us last night -- I mean late in the fourth. We have guys that can go get it. That's the luxury of our team. I'm happy to have it.",
        "7": "I don't know. Just trying to play hard and win basketball games. That's a question for D-Rose I guess.",
        "8": "I like to play any style. Any time you are compared to a great -- to a hall-of-famer, to a multi-ring championship player like Magic coverage it's humbling, honestly. I can play any style. I try to take what the defense gives me and go with the flow of the game.",
        "9": "That's what we pride ourselves on. Especially the fourth quarter. We feel like if we go into the lead in the fourth quarter it's going to be tough to beat us because we pride ourselves on defense in the fourth. And we consistently could get stops and get stops and get stops, we have enough guys that can make shots on the other end of the court. We're able to break the game open. That's what we've been able to do the last two games, game 2 and Game 3. We got stops and got stops and got stops, and then we just consistently worked the offense and made a few shots and was able to bust open the game.",
        "12": "Emotions get played. I'm not saying with Joakim -- I'm speaking about that was right. I don't think it was right what he said. But emotions does get said throughout the course of the game when you get emotional. We know there's going to be microphones. We know there's going to be cameras around. You have to be cautious about what you say. You try to control your emotions as much as possible, even though it's a very intense game. But we know. It comes with the territory. You get the great press, you get the bad press when you do something wrong. As role models to kids and as role models to people who watch us every day, we understand that. We have to own up to it.",
        "13": "He's a good player. Let's not take away from the fact the guy is a max player. He got max money. He has done some great things in the postseason. If you look at his postseason numbers, he's played extremely well. We knew he wanted to get out there for his team. Eight rebounds and things like that. He played a great game last night. Offensive rebounds, made big shots for his team. We knew that, we talked about it coming into Game 3, he was going to be more aggressive. Derrick Rose was going to be more aggressive. We have to make sure we key in on them and shut down the other guys too.",
        "14": "Their team is a little bit different than ours. They have two max players. I was the only max player on my team. They got some great complementary players as well. You know, I can relate. I can definitely relate, being -- having the coach of the year and getting the MVP and then going to get out and go against people who have multiple guys that can go against you and break you down. I can relate to what he's going through right now. They have a great team. I'm not about to sit here and say this team is down and out. That's a great team. We are looking forward to the challenge. We know they're going to bring it in Game 4.",
        "15": "Yeah, man.",
        "16": "I'm hurting a little bit right now, but I'll be all right for Game 4. It's the camera -- you guys -- the media and camera guys are too close on the floor, and there ain't no room for comfort.",
        "21": "Makes us a very tough team to beat when he's aggressive like that. Inside and outside. We always say he's the key to our team. He's a relieve guy for us. Anytime things are going slower, me and D-Wade aren't getting anything in the perimeter, not getting anything in the paint, we can always go back to him and know we're going to get a good shot. Number three guy, as far as the shooting percentage in the series, behind D-Wade and -- who was it? DWYANE WADE: Gasol. LeBRON JAMES: Yeah, Gasol. DWYANE WADE: That other guy. LeBRON JAMES: Those other guys. CB is (Indiscernible). He's doing a great job. Just capitalizing on the attention we get. He's making them pay.",

        "0": "LeBron, you seemed really comfortable in the quarterback role the first two or three quarters, passing, waiting for guys to get open and give them the ball. Describe what you were seeing out there.",
        "2": "When you see that Derrick Rose only attempts two field goals in the fourth quarter and seems to at times have trouble attacking the paint, do you feel what you guys are doing defensively in terms of scheme and execution is working at this stage?",
        "4": "Point guard play tonight, huge contributions after Bibby was struggling with his three-point shot heading into this game and Chalmers struggled in Game 2, and then he played the entire fourth quarter. Can you talk about the point guard play tonight.",
        "6": "You're 7-0 at home in the playoffs. The only team undefeated at home. How big is Tuesday?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "I was seeing two defenders all night. Two or three defenders. I came into the game knowing that they were going to try to load up on myself and D-Wade. So I just changed my game plan tonight, be more of a facilitator. If I needed to get it going offensively, I could. The great thing about it CB had it going. When we have someone going on our team, we continue to give the ball to him and continue to feed off their energy offensively. And he brought it home for us tonight.",
        "2": "I think defensively what we've done all year has worked. We have a system, and we make adjustments at times. But we stick to our guns. We know defensively when we're active and guys are on the string and if one guy gets beat, another guy is there to help him, we're very good. So Derrick Rose is a great player. He's going to find creases. He's going to get his shots. That's what great players do. We try to make it tough for him. Try to make it tough for not only him but his teammates, also, make them take tough contested shots. It's a long series still. Through three games we found a way to just play our defense and not dictate our defense on what they do. We just play our game.",
        "4": "They were great tonight. Bibby knocking down two huge threes for us in the third. And I think 'Rio (Chalmers) coming in and having his hand. He also got a strip, a big steal for us. He was solid. Derrick Rose is a great player. Our point guards just try to stay in front of him as much as possible, trying to contain him. They're doing a great job so far. Our point guards are very key to our team. When they play big and make shots and also defend like they are doing, we're a pretty good team.",
        "6": "I mean, I think they're looking at it how we looked at it after Game 1, saying if we can walk out of here with a split, then we feel comfortable going home. That's what they're thinking. Coming into our home building, we have to continue to give our fans what they want. That's wins. We come in with the same mindset as we had Game 2 and Game 3. Defending, executing offensively, we give ourselves a good chance. It's a very good rebounding team. We've done a great job of just trying to lower those offensive rebounds and second-chance points each game from Game 1 to Game 2 to tonight. And if we do that, we give ourselves a good chance. We're looking forward to it."

        "0": "So you were like with the old ladies -- where were these classes?",
        "1": "The same with the swimming?",
        "2": "LeBron, your late-game shooting numbers have always been very good over your career. Among the best of the league from the percentage standpoint. How did the fact that you missed a few of those shots earlier this year, does that make it more gratifying what you've been doing the last three weeks, making those game shots?",
        "3": "LeBron, how vital is it for just the overall success of everything, the fact that the entire -- all 15 are here? We see you guys after every practice real loose and vocal, Damp was jumping around, guys who are not necessarily getting minutes. How key is that?",
        "5": "LeBron, with the days off, not being the regular season with back-to-backs and what not, is it easy to play the amount of minutes that you've been playing?",
        "6": "When you go home, do you make a concerted effort over the last couple of days to stay off your legs and not do anything? I know you got a workout here.",
        "10": "LeBron, what do you think the outcome of the series will be? Is it going to be like against the Celtics in five games or is it going to be tougher?",
        "11": "LeBron, how often do you think about winning the title during the course of the day? Five, ten times? Is it a tangible thought?",
        "12": "Did you put Dwyane's ring on before?",
        "14": "You guys have had a lot of success in the playoffs at home, and the Bulls also hang their hat on the fact that they haven't lost two games in a row as well. Something is going to have to give tomorrow. Either one of you can answer that.",
        "16": "LeBron, for those of us who haven't been on the NBA floor, what's that physical fight like under the glass for rebounds?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It was back home. I can't tell you exactly where it's at. It's a secret place. We hold a secret society over there. We don't tell too many people.",
        "1": "Yes, the same with the swimming.",
        "2": "I mean, I didn't want to miss those ones earlier in the season. Of course not. You want to come through for your teammates anytime you're in those situations. When you're put in those situations time after time after time, you're going to miss some. Ultimately, if you have confidence in yourself, if your teammates continue to have confidence in you, you're going to come through for them. And you're going to come through for yourself. Those shots result in a win, of course it's gratifying. I can't say it's not. I just have to keep it going.",
        "3": "We have a true professional team. Look at Dampier, the situation. He started a lot of games for us. E. House has played some big games for us, made big shots for us. And those guys are not particularly playing right now. But their spirit, they come in every day at practice and help us get better and play like it's a game situation. When you have true professionals, it's not about the I, it's about the we. And they understand that. We respect that to the fullest, being in that situation.",
        "5": "Man, if you had to play back-to-back in the postseason, no way I could play 45 minutes a game. It would never happen. With the time that you get off, it definitely helps the body to recover. But also at the same time, it's whatever it takes, honestly, in the postseason. I feel like personally if I'm not out there hurting the team, I'm out there playing big minutes, I feel I should be on the floor. If I'm out there and dogging and not playing at a high level defensively and I'm not helping the team and I'm playing these big minutes, I should come out and sit on the bench. Me just being in good shape and me continuing to -- when I'm on the court, just trying to help the team as best -- the best way possible and go from there.",
        "6": "Yeah. We do a good job of mixing it. You don't want to stay off your legs too much. You don't want to become sluggish. We got out a little bit yesterday. Had lunch. Got into the city a little bit. At night you just try to get off your legs as much as possible. It's a fine line, because you don't want to get out of rhythm. We come in here and get work in during the day, and then we try to relax during the night.",
        "10": "I don't know. We're just worried about Game 3, which is tomorrow night. We come out with the same intensity that we did in Game 2, we give ourselves a good chance to win.",
        "11": "It happens all day. It happens all the time. You dream about it, hosting that trophy up, the title, seeing the confetti rain. You have to have that vision. If you don't have that vision, I don't know exactly what you're being a part of this postseason for. I have that vision all the time. Even when I'm awake or I'm sleeping.",
        "12": "No, that's his. I'm good.",
        "14": "If it takes home court, that's what it's about. They talk about they haven't lost two games in a row. So we're going to protect home court, and try to come out with a win. We'll see what happens. Something has to give.",
        "16": "I don't know. It's unexplainable. Do you have any tattoos? You ask me how my tattoo feels, you can't explain that either. You have to be under the needle. Under the boards, it's a grind out there. You have to be physically and mentally strong to want to be out there and come up with the rebound. There are times you're down there battling, and you still don't get the rebound. You have to be physical for one, and you have to be mentally strong as well. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

        "2": "LeBron, you kind of had a terrific performance to bail the team out last game, and you did a couple of times the last round. You usually don't want to have to do it again. Talk about the ability to --",
        "6": "LeBron, you chased them pretty much the second half of the season trying to get that No. 1 seed. Now that you have home court, how do you value it? Can you exhale a little bit?",
        "9": "Watching the film, can you talk about stopping Derrick Rose, what worked and what you guys were able to do?",
        "17": "LeBron, can you guys address having a second half that was successful in Chicago and what it took?",
        "18": "Has your conditioning routine throughout your career been the same, or have you improved it or enhanced it over the years?",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We talked about that too on the plane. We were watching the film. This is the first time the lineup we envisioned at some point in the season finally had happened with us, Mike Miller, UD and CB out on the court at the same time. It worked.",
        "1": "We haven't been able to ease into anything this year, right?",
        "2": "I didn't bail our team out. We're all in it together. I made a few plays down the stretch. If we didn't continue to get stops defensively and give ourselves an opportunity to get in that position, we wouldn't be 1-1 now. It isn't a bailout. This is a 48-minute game. I made a few shots, but the screen that Mike Bibby set for me to get open on the three, you know, the movement that we had, for me to be able to get open in those plays. It's not a bailout. It's about teamwork.",
        "6": "There's no time for exhaling. We're in the Conference Finals. We understand this team is a very hard-working team. They're going to try to steal home court back. We've done some great things on our home court in this postseason, and we're looking to do that. Our fans deserve it. We're going to go out here and give it 110% the same way we played in Chicago Game 2 and see what happens with the final result.",
        "9": "Just try to keep a body in front of them. Try to make him stay out on the perimeter. He's so quick and so fast, he's going to break your defense down. When he does, our bigs did a great job of being there for us and having a high hand. When he hit the floor, had to go to the free-throw line to shoot two free-throws or making him take some contested lay-ups. We did a good job. He missed a few shots. You have to just try to stay in front of him as much as possible. It's easier said than done. But we have the personnel and the lineup changes that we just throw different bodies at him and continue to try to keep him off balance.",
        "17": "We knew that our third quarters haven't been the greatest in the postseason. We knew in order to even the series, we had to come out with a sense of urgency in the third quarter, and we did that. We got up by as much as 11 in the third quarter that gave us enough lead that when it was tied and we couldn't make a shot in the fourth, a couple of balls go here, a couple of balls go there, we were able to have enough of a lead in the third quarter where we could manage. That's what it's all about. We got out and we changed our halftime, our warmup thing. Usually guys we play so many minutes, we use it as downtime. We got out and got a good warmup and came out with a sense of urgency in the third quarter.",
        "18": "It's improved over the years. When you first -- of course, my rookie year you don't -- after game 30, you are about ready to quit. You hit that rookie wall. I played 27 games in the season in high school. It took me a couple of years to get into NBA-game shape. My first two years I didn't make the postseason, so after a few years in the postseason, I started to do more to try to enhance my wind. I've been able to be in some pretty good shape where I can play 40 to 45 minutes in a postseason game and be okay when the next game comes. At this point, it's the postseason. Whatever it takes. If I'm able to be out there and I'm not hurting the team by being out there playing 40 minutes or 45 minutes, I'll be out there for my team.",
        "19": "I did a lot of swimming this past off season, just try to take a lot of the grind off your legs when you're in the pool. I do pilates and yoga to stay in front of the curve. I feel like it's helping me. Does it work for everybody? I don't know. I'm not a guru on how to be in the best condition. Let me sit here and tell you that. But it works for me."

Play it by series. And the lineup that coach puts out there, you float with it. We've had enough minutes with every lineup as far as who has been the starting point guard and who has been the starting center, we can be comfortable with it when it happens.",
        "6": "Absolutely. We have to do a better job of rebounding. Fourth straight time we've gotten outrebounded by the Bulls in the regular season. That's where they're very dominant. We did a great job of holding them on forced attempts. 38% from the floor. They got up to 42, 43%. We allowed them 13 to 21. (Indiscernible) Me and D-Wade is athletic enough. We're aware enough to see where the ball is coming off the rim, or first coming off, to go get it.",
        "7": "At this point (Indiscernible).",
        "12": "Absolutely. That's one thing we can learn from, the regular season, the postseason. To learn from our mistakes from the previous game and then move on. We've done that. We're looking forward to the challenge. We're excited about tomorrow's opportunity to be here and try to steal home court.",
        "13": "That's just energy. You can't practice hustle plays and getting on the floor and getting loose balls and things like that. Nobody practices those. Joakim doesn't practice diving on the floor on loose balls or outworking. You don't practice those. It's in you. You have to be determined to go get it.",
        "14": "Is it a pride thing? It's competitive. This is the biggest stage. If you don't have it by this point, you're in the wrong business.",
        "15": "I've been down before. DWYANE WADE: We've been behind before in our careers. You understand -- as we continue to say, you understand that you have to approach every game, every possession as its own. You can't think we're down one game. It's a seven-game series. We moved on from Game 1 yesterday. Today we come in and prepare for Game 2. We approach it totally different than Game 1.",

        "20": "Absolutely. I know it means a lot more to him personally playing a meaningful series in his hometown. At the end of the day, even though the fans boo him, we all know they still love him. You have to respect a kid coming from the inner city from Chicago that's done the things that he's done as a professional on and off the court. We all know how they really feel. But they have to root for their team. Whoever is wearing that jersey, that's who they're going to root for. Whoever is not, they're going to boo. We understand. FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports"

It was an amazing moment for me to see kids that people want to write up and become a statistic. It was a great moment for myself just to be a part of that.",
        "3": "You know, I'm not sure. And I think we all hope that there is not a lockout. I mean, you see what this event -- how great this event is tonight. And not only tonight, but this whole weekend, what it brings. You've got the NBA Cares. You've got the NBA Saturday Night and the NBA Friday Night and everything that goes on with this weekend, you would hope that there's no stoppage in play. We don't know what it's going to take, yet, but I don't know, to answer your question, what I'll be doing as far as a game plan, if work stops.",
        "4": "I got a lot of rest. I got a lot of rest. I was able to get like 12 hours of sleep every single day. Don't I look rested? (Laughing).",
        "5": "You know, for the first two thirds of the season, we played some good basketball. For the last third of the season, we have to understand that we cannot afford to take a step backwards and we have to keep moving forward. Every game, every practice, every film session, we have to figure out a way to get better, no matter if we are just coming in for a shoot around or if we are coming in for a game where it's four and five nights where it's back-to-back. We have to continue to get better, because there are teams out there that's better than us right now. We are moving at a cheetah's place, we are trying to move as fast as possible to get to where we want to get to compete at the highest level.",
        "6": "Anything that has to do with kids, for me. Anything had a has to do with underprivileged kids, like I always bring the statistics up. I grew up in an inner city, and they always try to shoot down your dreams and say that it's not possible. I'm one of those few kids that made it. And I know where I come from. So I always said, if I ever had an opportunity to be successful in whatever I do in life that I was always going to give back to under privileged kids who believe and have a dream and try to make that dream become a reality.",
        "7": "Well, he played great. He came out from the start very aggressive. You know, did he what Kobe Bryant does every night, and that's score the basketball. That's probably one of the best scorers that the game has ever seen. He helped lead his team to victory. So he definitely deserved it.",
        "8": "I mean, those are all great players. You are looking at -- if you are talking about the early '90s or late '80s, I mean, when you talk about All-Star Game, these are the greatest players in the league at that particular moment, 24 of the best players the league has to offer. You know, you have athleticism, you have guys that can fly, you have guys that can shoot the ball extremely well and you have guys that can handle the ball like no other. You have Isiah Thomas and you have Chris Paul; you have Michael Jordan and you've got Kobe Bryant; you've got Magic Johnson and you've got I guess myself, and the list goes on. So the game has not changed that much. We just try to follow the footsteps those guys were able to lay down for us and make this game a beautiful game to watch. End of FastScripts"

It's a tribute to their success and it's a tribute to their coaches understanding how good those guys are and I think it's fun. It has not went our way yet but we are going to continue to work. We have got a little ways to go to get to where they are but it's definitely a team that can handle success.",
        "1": "I have. I'm not going to sit here and elaborate on it because there's way too much going on with that whole situation, but I wish best for him in whatever decision he makes in his career.",
        "2": "Yeah, they did the draft, they took two captains.",
        "3": "No, because Eastern Conference, Western Conference, we don't like each other. We would not pick somebody from the Western Conference to be over here to be with us and I don't think they would, either. I don't think it would work.",
        "4": "I don't know if I would be a captain. There's so many great athletes in our game, both teams will be equal because you have 24 of the best players in the league in that particular time.",
        "5": "Growing up as a kid, I think one I can really look back on is looking at Vince Carter, his Dunk Contest moment. I was in high school when that happened. To this day, that probably was the best Dunk Contest I've seen. You go back to the 80s, late 80s with Jordan, but what Vince Carter did in the Dunk Contest, I think it was in Oakland, if I'm not mistaken. It was amazing.",
        "6": "Absolutely. Will Smith is amazing. Denzel is amazing. One of my favorites, Martin Lawrence. A lot of great actors out there for sure.",
        "7": "Concerned, not sure. I'm optimistic about it. Hopefully both sides can come away with an agreement that benefits both sides. No one wants to see a lockout, not the fans, not the players, not the owners. This game is too big and everyone enjoys it so much. Hopefully things can get situated before the start of the season.",

        "11": "I definitely love all of my fans. They gave me an opportunity to be a starter on the East team. As far as being booed, I thrive on it. I love it and you get an opportunity to go into hostile buildings and hear a lot of boos, but at the same time, they respect what you do.",
        "12": "It's definitely tough. It seems like it's out of his hands, though. It's different for me because I was unrestricted. I could get a deal whenever I wanted to, and I chose to go to Miami. I would definitely support whatever Carmelo Anthony does, he's a really good friend of mine and a brother and I wish him the best.

      "answers": {
        "2": "I think right now it's a feel-out process for myself, for D-Wade, for Chris and for the rest of the guys. You know, and I talked to those guys, it almost felt like we were being too unselfish to get each other into the flow of the game, and the reason we're here and the reason we've been successful is because we've put ourselves in a position to be aggressive at all times no matter who's out on the court. I think in the third quarter, I think D-Wade started to be more aggressive, I started to be more aggressive, even Chris started to be more aggressive. But we didn't make our shots. We have to understand we can't be too unselfish because we have so many options. We just have to play our game and it's going to be better for the team.",
        "3": "Well, like I said, it's a feel-out process. When you have so many options it's something I'm not accustomed to, having that many threats out on the court at the same time. It kind of reminded me at times throughout the USA practices. Coach K really had to get on us one day because we were being too unselfish because we had so many options. You'd have unforced turnovers and you seen me and D-Wade had 14 turnovers between us, too. A lot of them was being too unselfish when we had an open look. You're going to have that early. As the cohesiveness continues to get better, we've got to protect the balls more, but we'll learn where the guys want the ball on the court. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "LeBron, about 24 hours ago you were sitting in Connecticut. And you know what the reaction was in Cleveland, what your former owner, his reaction to your decision. And then you come to Miami and you have this show tonight. Can you just sort of take us through emotionally what these 24 hours have been like for you?",
        "1": "LeBron, what would you like to say directly in response to what Gilbert put out last night, and what do you have to say to the fans in Northeast Ohio that you left behind?",
        "2": "Now that everything is settled, you guys are all here. Can you go ahead and end the madness and explain when this partnership really was formed and how many meetings you all had together and dispel some of the rumors and all that kind of stuff?",
        "3": "LeBron, this question is for you. What did Pat Riley say to you during that visit that really stuck out with you? And the reports that he brought championship rings, if he did, what did you think?",
        "4": "I didn't go to Saint Bs, by the way, I went to Archbishop Hogan?",
        "10": "All three of you guys, I'm sure you know some of the comments that are already coming out around the league. Orlando's questioning LeBron's competitiveness. And Joakim called you guys Team Hollywood already. Sort of respond to that first. And secondly, what were your reactions to the \"Beat LA\" chants out there tonight?",
        "11": "The \"Beat LA\" chants.",
        "14": "LeBron, you talked about the criticism a little bit. You've got people saying that coming here you've diminished your brand because you're with these guys, whereas had you gone to New York they would have said you were all about your brand and nothing else. Or had you gone to Cleveland, they would have said all he cared about was being the main guy on his team. Did you almost feel like you were in a no-win situation in making your decision; and that being the case, how much does it help to have the support of these guys and this organization?",
        "15": "LeBron, yesterday when you walked out before the decision, it almost looked like you were the jury foreman about to give the defendant the guilty verdict. Today, when you came down from the sky, with the dry ice and these guys, you looked like a little boy on the playground. Is that accurate? And can you tell me how tough yesterday was compared to how much fun tonight was?",
        "17": "There seems to be a notion out there that because each of you have been the man on your respective teams that there could be chemistry issues and that there needs to be an alpha dog on each team. How do you answer questions like that?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It's been the process -- the process that I believe that I wanted to go through when I did my short-term deal a few years ago. And it's been emotionally draining at times. It's been exciting. It's been nerve-racking. I've been scared at times. I've been afraid. But at the same time I've accepted the challenge to move on. And I feel great. I feel great now and the fans and this organization has put me back in a family-oriented place where I've always been.",
        "1": "First off, I don't have a reaction to what Dan said. You know, when things hit the fan you see guys' true colors. And I understand that. I wish that organization the best of luck. I wish those fans the best of luck, because I still do love those fans, no matter where I put myself for the rest of my life. I still got a lot of friends on that team. And I wish them the best of luck. But as far as me responding to what Dan has to say, I don't have a reaction, because at the end of the day Dan's comments will not stop me and my family from sleeping at night. It just won't do it. It's only just going to make us powerful, more powerful.",
        "2": "I can take it. The partnership was formed, I think it was June 25th of 2003, I think, or around -- it was one of those days, the day of the Draft. That was the day when this partnership was formed. No one even knew. We didn't know. But we was all drafted 1, 4 and 5. And then once again, being a part of the same Olympic team. Once again, we was a part of a team but didn't know this would happen. But we was forming then. Losing in the world championship, and then winning a gold medal, once again, another opportunity where we were together but didn't know we would be together like this. As far as the rumors and allegations about us having a meeting in Miami and us having meetings on Mars and all these other places, that stuff was all rumors. We talk. We're friends. We talk throughout the year all year long about our lives, about our seasons, how they're going. But we followed the process just like everybody did, after that July 1st date. I hate to speak for all of us, but we're here now. And we're here for a long time.",
        "3": "I think from a basketball standpoint, Pat threw out the possibility of us teaming up together. That was great. The possibility of us All-Stars, us superstars uniting to become one, that was great. But that wasn't the best thing about it. As good as Dwyane Wade is and as good as Chris Bosh and as good as I am individually, that wasn't even the best part of the meeting. The best part of the meeting was the whole family thing, how we are a close-knit family. We do everything as a family. We win. We lose. Blood, sweat and tears, all that as a family. And that's what I've always been a part of my whole life. That's always, since I was a kid, what I always seeked for. And when I heard that from Pat and from Micky, it was -- that was kind of like the icing on the cake for me. And the rings was pretty cool. (Laughter) I need a few of those.",
        "4": "I hate Archbishop Hogan. They're a rival. (Laughter).",
        "10": "We're in the same conference now with Orlando, so we'll deal with them later. As far as Joakim, I got a little history with Joakim. If me and D-Wade or me and Bosh, or Bosh and D-Wade went to Miami, then he wouldn't have said nothing about Team Hollywood -- I mean, to Chicago. He wouldn't have said nothing about Team Hollywood. And what was your last one?",
        "11": "LA team is a team -- I think every team in the NBA wants to get to that point and that's to hoist the trophy. But it's not just about beating LA. We understand what the fans want, but it's a process. Starting from day one, starting from training camp, us processing and taking every team as it's our last and not taking no games for granted. And Orlando, that's funny that they questioned my competitiveness. I like that. I like locker room -- we're going to put a lot of stuff in the locker room before the season start. (Laughter) I know Pat and I know Micky, they're going to do a lot -- if they don't do it I'm going to have a lot of stuff in my locker. It's on. DWYANE WADE: You're trying to make -- we wanted to play when we got out there, heard the crowd. You're really trying to make us come out of the suit now. We're competitive. And you don't make this decision to come together. And I understand people are going to say stuff. And we accept it with open arms. Bring it on. That's why we play this game. We play this game to have that competitive nature, competitive juices. You expect those teams to say that. We don't expect them to say, okay, Miami's won it. We don't want that. We didn't play together so people can just lay down. We want to come out here and we want to give this Miami crowd a show every night. And even on the road. Because every place is going to sell out when we come to town. So they can thank us now. (Laughter). CHRIS BOSH: Yeah. I mean, you know, I like Hollywood. I really like Hollywood. Maybe we can run with that one. But, I mean, what was the question again. I can't even remember.",
        "14": "In the life I live today, the way I am blessed, the way the man above has given me these God-given abilities, there's no way I'm in a lose-lose situation. Every day I wake up, see my family, my two sons running around just loving life, there's no way I'm in a lose-lose situation. I'm going out here playing a game of basketball, the game I love, the game I played as a kid for free, and we still play for free. So there's no lose-lose situation for me here. I'm playing a game of basketball. And it just so happens we've got cameras and people writing about it. So until you understand who LeBron James is, LeBron James is in a win-win situation and will continue to be in a win-win situation. DWYANE WADE: Yah. (Laughter) that was a yah moment. You all wanted to say it too. You're all shaking your head yah, what he said.",
        "15": "Yesterday was really tough. Mixed emotions, like I said, before earlier. At the end of the day I think my mother helped me. She really put the icing on the cake for me. Yesterday I talked to her before I came and did the interview on ESPN with Jim Gray. And she was like -- I told her where I was leaning towards. She was like: I believe you're making the right decision. You gotta do what's best for you, because at the end of the day people are going to do what's best for them. If you put the shoe on the other foot, we would see how people will react. And it's kind of the opposite what my mom was going to say. Because sometimes my mom get long winded and she say things that's off the wall, but at the same time I know she has my best interests. But yesterday she was -- she gave me the green light on where I was leaning towards. That made me feel more comfortable in that interview, even though how tough it was, because I was letting a lot of people in Northeast Ohio down. It's tough. But today, to be here, to be part of this Miami Heat organization, to see those fans come out on short notice, to be here with D-Wade, to be here with C.B., I understand now that I've made the right decision. And to also hear my former owner's comments, I absolutely know I made the right decision.",
        "17": "You look at our 2008 Olympic team, the biggest thing that I got out of that, not only did all 12 guys -- because we had 12 guys on that team also. But not only did we all sacrifice things, Dwyane -- D-Wade, Flash, what you guys call him, he came off the bench and had no problem with coming off the bench. He's a starter. He's always been a starter. He's an All-Star. He's a superstar. World renowned, and he came off the bench. And that's what sacrifice is all about. At times, yeah, there's going to have to be an alpha dog that steps up, gets in somebody's face. If I need to be that guy, I will be that guy, to make sure that everybody is understanding what this is all about. This is not just all about D-Wade and C.B. and LeBron. It's about the whole team. It's about the whole organization, starting from the top to the bottom. So, I mean, it may change from game to game. But if I have to be that guy, then my leadership, my command, I'm up for the taking. But this whole sacrifice thing or saying that we can't do it together, you know it sounds a little crazy."

The atmosphere was unbelievable, a hundred-plus thousand people were in the thousands and millions watched it on TV. So it was an unbelievable time for myself, you know, and for the rest of the guys, even the guys that was injured, including Kobe.",
        "1": "Well, like I said, I mean, I go out and play my game every night for the team to win. You know, whatever it takes for our team to win, I go out and do it.",
        "2": "And Dwight. We have a lot of experience together. We played a lot of games, especially international. So we are able to have some chemistry more than others when we play in these All-Star Games, being that we all play in the Eastern Conference.",
        "3": "It's fun going against anyone and he's already the cream of the crop when you talk about the best players in the NBA. He is a competitor, I just try to go out and have fun, and at the same time, especially in this atmosphere, give the fans what they want to see more than just putting the ball in the basket.",
        "4": "He's a great player and tonight he showcased why he's one of the best players on the planet. You want to play with guys that are great and want to win and want to compete at a high level every night. We'll see.",
        "5": "I'm aware of the talk just like everybody else. I've been a part of guys getting traded to our team and getting traded away from our team. I never get caught up into it until I know or hear from our coaching staff or GMs that the deal has actually happened. I hear as much as you guys hear.",
        "6": "Didn't talk about it at all this week with him. I think Amare has been hearing the trade rumors all season. That's the last thing I wanted to bring up with him about being traded or having -- being a teammate as he is. He's one of the premiere athletes that we have in our game, but you know, we'll see if it happens. But it's all speculation. There's a lot of speculation that goes on. The only deal that has gotten done is between Dallas and Washington that we know for sure. Other than that, everything else is just talk.",
        "7": "It was unbelievable. To be in front of 108,000, that was actually what it was, that was not a false number. You could look up in the stands, and there was not a seat open; to be part of history is something that you always wish and dream for. I've been part of some historical events, being a part of the 2008 Olympics when we played China it was the largest international game that the Olympics had ever seen, as far as viewers. And you know, being part of another historical event tonight, you know, it's humbling and it's great to be a part of it.",
        "8": "Oh, I don't deal with that. That's why I've got an assistant that takes care of all of that. I don't have to deal with that. (Laughter).",
        "9": "No. Putting on a show for the fans is something I do, something I live for and something, that's just my game. My game is geared to doing things that a lot of people haven't seen before, every night, and bring excitement to the game. But as far as pressure, I've never been a big believer in pressure at all.",
        "10": "I mean, growing up, you don't know what a 100,000 is, growing up. You grow up, you say you're playing in front of -- a building at capacity, probably six or seven hundred people if you go to high school basketball games. Growing up, you can't even count to a 100,000.",
        "11": "The experience is great, I had an opportunity to not only play basketball, but also give back in the communities. I had a few community events that I had. One of them was at Oak Cliff Boys & Girls Club, where I donated a playground and refurbished a game room in that Boys & Girls Club and that was great. Me and Jay also had an opportunity to give back to another Boys & Girls Club and we gave away probably like $30,000 worth of gifts ranging from CDs and scholarships for kids. Not only what we do in basketball, but to be in the community and see kids and see what their faces are like when you step into their presence is another fulfillment for myself. End of FastScripts"

        "3": "Your teammates are talking about how you have been really smart about trying to get him into foul trouble. What do you do to do that?",
        "4": "What does it mean to you guys when he does foul out of the game? Does that open things up to you?",
        "5": "What gives you the most confidence about coming in here and winning Game 6?",
        "6": "You looked like Paul Pierce here in the fourth quarter playing on that elbow.",
        "7": "You got it in your game, but you haven't done a whole lot of that.",
        "8": "Remind me, did you do some of that with the Olympic team? I think I remember something.",
        "9": "How much did that experience influence what you're doing?",
        "10": "How much did you and Dwight go at it in practice during the Olympics?",
        "11": "How much did you learn from going against him in those situations? Did you learn about him and his game?",
        "12": "Other than making shots, did you notice anything different maybe in Mo's pace at all?",
        "13": "With the strategy you guys used last night in the fourth with you at the top of the key possession after possession after possession, some of the television analysts I hear them say it is too much load for a guy to carry for two games, three games to keep doing that. Do you buy into that?",
        "14": "Last night it was every possession almost.",
        "15": "Six years.",
        "16": "Have you noticed fatigue coming from Orlando?",
        "17": "This may be hard to quantify. All the fourth quarters you sat, the two eight-day rest periods, is that helping your legs right now?"

      "answers": {
        "0": "Yeah, man. I slept really well. Difficult to sleep at 5:00 in the morning, you know what I'm saying? Wake up late in the afternoon but feel good.",
        "1": "Both teams. Both teams need to win. We need to win to keep on going, and they need to win to close out. Pressure -- I have never been a big believer in pressure. I don't really believe in it. So I'm the wrong man to ask about pressure.",
        "2": "It's a challenge. We all know how big and strong he is. I try to bring that same intensity when I go to the hole and just try to meet at the ends, I guess. It's tough. It's tough sometimes. You get beat up sometimes going in the air, but you got to continue to be aggressive, continue to try to get him in foul trouble.",
        "3": "Just try to attack. They are a very good team. My game is all towards attacking and what the defense gives me. You know, Dwight is their anchor on defense. If you attack the anchor, then it is tough for that defense to standstill. We got to continue to be aggressive.",
        "4": "I mean, any time you get the Defensive Player of the Year off the court, it's a lot. Imagine if KG fouled out last year in the playoffs, it is a totally different ball game so that's key.",
        "5": "I think what we did in Game 4. We pretty much lost that game on an out-of-bounds play giving it to Rashard. We know we can play well. I mean, a team is dangerous when they know they are on their last limb and especially with us. I think we are very dangerous at this point. I mean, it is going to be a crazy atmosphere. We look forward to the challenge.",
        "6": "Paul probably -- Paul and Kobe are the best guys that we have in our game, and Dirk, at that elbow right there, sending it to the free-throw line. So I stole a little bit from those guys.",
        "7": "No, I haven't. But against this team, I think you have to change up sometimes and that's the point on the floor where most teams can't dole from because I can see both sides of the court. If I'm on one side, they make them load from one side. Me being in the middle of the court with shooters on both sides, it is tough for a team to defend that. It is probably going to be something we go to late in the game.",
        "8": "Yeah, especially when teams went zone. Coach K would put me at the free-throw line. I would be that guy I caught it at the elbow, I can either attack or I can see both sides of the floor having Carmelo and Kobe on both wings. So I did that a lot.",
        "9": "It helped, of course. I mean, any time you can do some things in the game, you know, in a previous situation, you get comfortable with it. And I was very comfortable being at that position last night, just catching the ball with a live dribble at the free-throw line with shooters on both sides.",
        "10": "A lot. When Coach broke up the teams -- we were in the starting lineup, of course. When Coach broke up the teams, we all went at it, all 12 guys. You got 12 of the best players in the world. We helped each other get better every day.",
        "11": "He's challenging. He's great. Dwight is going to be the most dominant player in our league for a long time to come. Dwight is going to be great, man. He's young. I'm young. We are just going to continue to grow.",
        "12": "Mo's pace is always high. When he's making shots, he's confident. He believes he can make any shot on the court. He came off an opening. He is going to be aggressive, and he's going to take shots. He's going to live if he misses them. He is going to live if he makes them. He wasn't worried about the consequences of missed shots. He just came out and believed he would make every one.",
        "13": "It's been five games.",
        "14": "It has been every possession for five straight games.",
        "15": "Exactly. So I was built for it, man. I don't -- I don't die down. I didn't die down at no point in the game last night. Wasn't tired. Felt great. It is just -- when you haven't seen something like that for a long time in this league, it is easy to say there is too much pressure on a guy. I live for the moment. I'm okay with it.",
        "16": "There is fatigue on both teams. It is almost June. There should be fatigue. We can only -- the body can only take so much. But both teams are just trying to get through and just trying to stay mentally focused. At this point, fatigue is a factor, but mentally you have to be more in shape than you have to be physically.",
        "17": "Oh, yeah. The rest that I've gotten during the season with the way we was playing the basketball throughout the season has definitely helped me. I only averaged 36 minutes a the game throughout the regular season. I knew in the playoffs it could bump up, and I was ready for it. Throughout this series I averaged 40-plus minutes and felt like the same 36 minutes I played during the regular season. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "I know you had mentioned throughout the series that you guys had a matchup, that the Orlando Magic pretty much matched up very well with you guys and it has been a challenge throughout this series to get ahead. What did you guys do tonight to win by at least ten points?",
        "1": "LeBron, you guys shot the basketball extremely well tonight. But the one thing I liked about it, you got back to getting stops at crucial times in the fourth quarter. How big was that?",
        "3": "LeBron, you had a streak in the fourth quarter where you were either making or assisting on every field goal. What were you doing to facilitate out there?",
        "4": "You talked about being ready for this game mentally and this is the kind of situation you thrive in. Talk about your mental approach in the fourth quarter and what was going through your head.",
        "6": "LeBron, you were able to get the ball a lot in the fourth quarter right at the top of the key, having not used a dribble yet. Is that something fairly new you put in? And what advantage is it for you to have that where you can already shoot the ball or do what you want?",
        "8": "LeBron, you guys offensively, how much of a conscious effort did y'all make to make sure the ball kept moving rather than it getting stagnant and you kind of doing everything?",
        "9": "LeBron, you obviously started off on Hedo in the fourth quarter, forced a 24-second violation. What do you have to do defensively on a guy like Hedo to really keep him from dictating action?",
        "10": "Dwight fouled out again tonight. You stated before the series began that you were still going to try to take it to him. Has that been the one consistent factor that you continue to have success, taking it right to him?",
        "11": "Do you think he might be off his game a little bit thinking about his technicals?",
        "12": "LeBron, the sense of urgency that you guys played with tonight, was that something that was maybe missing earlier in this series because of the way the first two series was won for you guys?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We covered the three-point line really well today. They killed us from the three-point line last game making, 17 3s, and the whole just great shooting team is 32 percent from the three-point line was to our benefit. We had a conscious effort of getting out to their shooters. If they were going to make some, they were going to make it over a contested hand. It worked to our benefit.",
        "1": "That's what we make our mark at, man. We got to find a way to get stops down the stretch. We haven't done that throughout this series until tonight. In Game 1 we gave up a 3 to Rashard Lewis when we was up two. In Game 4 we give up another 3 to Rashard Lewis. That's when we made our mark at it all season, man, by just clamping down in crucial situations throughout the course of a season and throughout the course of a game, especially in the fourth quarter. We finally did that tonight.",
        "3": "Just take what the defense give me. When my guys make shots, it makes it a lot easier on myself because they're -- now it allows me to go one-on-one with a defender. They can't help as much. And when they did help, they knocked down three-point shots and Andy got a one-handed layup. That's what I need from my guys. I don't add no more pressure on my teammates, but they know we're a very strong team when they knock down shots.",
        "4": "Just close out. We was down one to start the fourth and I knew coach was just going to -- it was win or go home at this point, so I knew I was going to play the whole fourth. Just wanted to -- my guys, they had made shots through the first three quarters, so I knew it was going to be an opportunity for me to probably press the gas a little bit on the offensive end. And they continued to make shots in the fourth. I always feel like myself individually I can always get going any part of the game.",
        "6": "That's key. Something that as a unit players and coaches we came up with, trying to figure out a way we can try to exploit their defense with all our shooters out there. And having a live dribble either at the top of the key or free-throw line is key for myself and for our team because now it adds a threat of me jabbing, jabbing, taking a shot or getting to the paint and either taking a shot for myself or creating for my teammates. So any time you are as dangerous as I am or the best guys in this League and you have a live dribble, it makes you that much more dangerous because they don't know what you are going to do.",
        "8": "That was huge. I mean, that defense is very good when you allow the ball to just stay on one side and you just dribble and dribble and now you are getting down to five seconds on the shot clock and now you got to try to race and get up a good shot. By Mo and Delonte and also Daniel coming and pushing the ball up the court and getting us into our sets early, it allows us now to be comfortable with now attacking it with ten on the shot clock instead of five. Getting the ball moving against this team is key.",
        "9": "Hedo is an all-star in my mind. You look at their team, you can say they have four all-stars with injured Jameer and Rashard and Dwight. Hedo is -- him and Rashard, they are clutch players they have. Just try to take the challenge. At this point it's -- you got to just take the challenge, man. Especially when you are on your last leg, you just got to take the challenge, and I did that.",
        "10": "That's what I do. I attack no matter who is in the paint. No matter what's going on, I just try to attack. Even though I know he is a defensive player of the year, you just got to try to attack a guy like that, man. He is very good with space. If you allow a guy like that to get space, then he is able to jump and create and block shots. That's how he gets a lot of his weak side blocks and coming across and blocking shots. If you don't give him much space, you hit him, make contact with him, it is tough for a guy like that to get off the court.",
        "11": "I don't know. I think Dwight was just in here, like, five minutes ago. So I don't know. (Smiling). I'm good.",
        "12": "I think we started out the first two games with a sense urgency. They just made a run and we weren't able to slow it down. They just caught us off guard. At this time, either you win or you chill at the house, you are playing with the kids a lot. You sit back and watch the finals. Something I envisioned. I signed up to play for a long time in the series and this season. There is always a sense urgency when you are on the brink of elimination. Thanks. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "I think the guys really knew that they had to play well for us to have a chance in this game tonight. Those guys definitely made shots the whole first half, and it was good to see that. Mo definitely put a lot of pressure on himself and he played well. And I think our bench came in in the first half and gave us a great lift.",
        "1": "We just got to continue to play hard, man. We've had -- we've lost two games off inbound plays. And being up two in Game 1, being up one, you know, tonight, and we've lost two games off inbound plays. So we got to be more in tune in our inbound plays. You got to communicate during that situation and not give up open shots or good looks down the stretch like that.",
        "2": "Of course I want the shot, man. I always feel like I can make any shot that I take. As it traveled, it didn't look good. It felt good leaving my hand but didn't look good in the air. Those are the breaks we have gotten this series, man. It just didn't go.",
        "3": "Well, it was a different situation because we had no time-outs. So we weren't able to get it at half court because we had to use our last time-out before I hit the 3 before that play. So it didn't go -- you know, I didn't go back to Game 2 and review it in my mind. I was just hoping that I could make one more.",
        "4": "Well, we just allowed Dwight to get a lot of paint catches. And I think in that instance, if he got dunks, we got to try to wrap him up and try to foul him and make two free throws. I think Dwight has done a great job of making his free throws. But, you know, statistically he might miss one. And we know he ain't going to miss no dunks or no lay-ups. We got to foul him in those situations, especially in a close game like that.",
        "5": "We got to close out games right away. We are giving ourselves a chance, and we are breaking down in areas that we haven't broke down all year. It is a great three-point shooting team. We got to give up something. I mean, Dwight is playing well, and he's a beast down the middle. So you try to shrink the floor. We open it up to their shooters, and then Dwight continues to get dunks and lay-ups. But we are executing on the other end. We need one stop. We haven't got one stop to win a ball game yet.",
        "6": "I feel good, man. This is the best I felt during the post-season in my NBA career. So fatigue hasn't played a factor. I continue to try to help our team, put our team in a position to win ball games. The ball is in my hand a lot, and I may have a few turnovers. That happens. But I have to figure out how to not have eight. Eight is unacceptable for me. That's way over what I've done throughout the whole playoffs or throughout this series. I won't turn the ball over as much. Some of them is just misqueue, some of them is just trying to make the right play. But fatigue has nothing to do with it.",
        "7": "Well, you deal with it, move on to the next game. We had our chances tonight. And we didn't execute. You move on to the next game. You try to get the game on Thursday back home and come back down here and try to get Game 6. We are looking forward to the challenge. I know I am. I'm up for the challenge, and I think my play, my leadership has spoke for that. So I will be ready, and I think our guys will be ready also.",
        "8": "We had another play called. But I was doubled at the time-out. Courtney Lee played under and Pietrus played right behind. So by any means, I went to go get the ball. That's the shot I can definitely make from that range. Just didn't go.",
        "9": "If I was Rashard Lewis, we would have won. I would have took the 3. But me being who I am, I took the two and got fouled and went up there and made two free throws. End of FastScripts"

        "2": "No. For what? We are just trying to get wins.",
        "3": "Well, I think we just got to ramp up a little bit. It is a very good team, we know that. Defensively we just got to try to take responsibility and take pride in guarding the guys on us, first, and rely on help, second. That's the defensive team we have always been. They got a really -- they got some really good players personnel-wise. We got to buckle down a little bit more.",
        "4": "I don't know. Like I said, they are a very good team. You know, we can't worry about, you know, teams winning 10-14. We got to worry about Game 4. If we harp on that, then it will not get us anywhere.",
        "5": "I think he will be fine. I'm fine. I'm excited about Game 4. As long as I stay upbeat, we got a chance, of course. So I'm confident and I'm sure the rest of the guys are confident.",

        "9": "Definitely our bench is -- I can't put a lot of pressure on our bench because they haven't really got a great opportunity to go out there and perform, so it is hard to say our bench isn't producing. I think when they get an opportunity to come in, they play pretty well. Our bench is key because I think on the other end, their bench is definitely coming in and giving them a big boost and we need it. Our bench has have been strong for us all year. When they come in, they need to do a good job, which they have done when they got the opportunity.",

        "12": "I'm not down. We're down 2-1. It is not like the series is over at all. Sometimes you face a situation in a series that you may not want to be in before a series even started but it happened. It is not like the series is over. We are looking forward to Game 4.

There is no -- there is no room for excuses at this point in the season. I mean, everybody is fatigued at this point in the season. There is no way you can hide away from it because of the intensity of the playoffs, the magnitude of the games, the possessions of the games, and the two teams trying to compete to move on to the next level. Fatigue is within everybody who approaches the game.",
        "1": "I think -- we just got to man up a little bit and take responsibility of who you are guarding. We have done it all year, and guarding the guys in front of us and then rely on help second. That's a very, very good team. A lot of credit to the Orlando Magic because it is a very good team. Take nothing away from them.",
        "2": "Well, we've had a few games this season where if no one is making shots then we don't look that good of a team. We've had -- we are a very good shooting team, but we've not found a way to find our stroke. I hope -- and I think we will. Guys are going to be confident about every shot that they take. And if they don't, they think about making the next one.",
        "3": "At this point, we are. They create a lot of matchup problems. The way Rashard spaces the floor, our bigs are not used to it. I think our bigs will do a good job of continuing to watch film and find a way to stay out on the perimeter with Rashard. They do -- they got some very big players that can shoot the ball. Also, they can drive, too, if you close out on them a lot. They have done a good job of exploiting that. We run out their shooters, they go around us. If we don't, they stop and shoot the 3. They have done a good job, and their coach has prepared them the right way.",
        "4": "He is a very active player. But, I mean, coming into this game I was shooting 60 percent from the field. So, you know, I missed a few shots tonight I'm capable of making. He is a very active defender, but I don't believe anybody is an individual that can guard me.",
        "5": "Every time we got it close, there is a whistle blown. I think the refs did a great job tonight. There was a few of them we thought was a little ticky-tack, but, hey, it happens throughout the course of a game. I mean, you look at it and they shoot 51 free throws, and Hedo went 1-11 from the field and but he goes to the line 12 times and makes 11 of them. That's very difficult to guard. When a good shooting team like they are go to the free throw, Dwight goes to the free throw a lot, we can live with that. But we can't allow Hedo to go to the line 12 times and Pietrus come off the bench and go to the line seven times. It is not helping our cause.",

Hopefully a few shots can go in and a few of theirs can go out. So it is a very good team. Like I said, give them a lot of credit.",
        "8": "I think it was. It was a little extra. The foul was called and he continued to swing his elbows. I mean -- I mean, you see Mo's face. It wasn't a pretty sight. It is not called for in this game. Is that it? Thanks. End of FastScripts"

      "questions": {
        "1": "LeBron, could you take us through not so much the shot but the moment after the shot. The MVP chants, your fans adoring you, is that something that you will soon forget?",
        "2": "I heard you say the other night for the Magic to go for a dagger. Was it perhaps giving the Magic a taste of their own medicine, and was that perhaps your greatest highlight of all times?",
        "3": "Turkoglu said that the way that you were celebrating and the Cavs and the bench was good. He says that means that Orlando is in your head now. Don't you think it is quite the opposite?",
        "4": "Right. You can use this as a momentum booster.",
        "6": "Did everything slow down? How long was that second?",
        "7": "You grew up in this area, so you know in the past the shot has meant something very different.",
        "9": "LeBron, since there was only one second left and there really wasn't time to get the ball back to the inbounder, are you surprised they didn't defend you with two guys the whole time?",
        "10": "A couple years later, people still talk about the 25 in the fourth quarter at Detroit. How does this compare to that? Would you put one ahead of the other?",
        "11": "LeBron, you just talked about Jerry West and Magic and what have you. You're a self-aware athlete. You recognize that you're building a legacy. Have you already or will you at some point take stock of that shot in terms of what it does for, you know, your career?",
        "13": "LeBron, when you caught, squared and let it go, was there any doubt in your mind? As you are watching it and Mo answered, too, was it in either of your minds that was going in? Can you tell when you released it was going in and did you think it was?",
        "15": "As a kid, when you took that shot, did you always make it or usually make that shot?",
        "18": "You guys have pretty much flowed through most of the play-off series you had. It seemed like this is one of the most challenging series you are going to have. What do you think you guys have to do in order to get ahold of these next couple games? What modifications do you have to make to the offense or defense?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "1": "Wow. I mean, the reaction from the fans and the teammates, the loudest it has ever been in this building was the first time I made the playoffs in my third year and we faced Washington and we ran out on the court on that game, the towels was out and it was unbelievable. I had lost my wind as soon as I ran out on the court. Tonight surpassed that by ten times. I mean, it was unbelievable. I mean, you couldn't -- I mean, you couldn't hear anything but just a roar of those 20,000-plus fans. And they deserve it. They deserve it.",
        "2": "The first option was for me to fake up and go for the lob. Two things happened. We had a 16 of Rashard Lewis on Mo, so it was going to be a difficult pass. When I went to go for the lob, Hedo had never been on it. I told Mo, whatever -- whatever it was going to take for me I was going to come get the ball, no matter what happened. If the first, third, second, if all options run, I'm going to come get the ball and I'm going to knock down the shot. It is the biggest shot I have made in my career.",
        "3": "Orlando is not in our head at all.",
        "4": "We respect that team a lot. This is a very good team we are playing. These are the four best teams in the game right now, you know, and they are battling. We are battling. We are going up big and they are making runs. It is going to happen. They are not in our head at all. We don't look at it as that. It is just two really good teams just going at it and having a pretty good series so far.",
        "6": "I just took my time. I just took my time. For me, a second is a long time for me. You know, for others it is very short. I mean, those are -- as a kid, you practice those type of moments, as a kid. As a basketball player, you are sitting in your backyard, you are in the gym and you are five, four, three, two, one (buzzer sound). Those are the moments that as kids -- you don't have to be in the NBA to know what I'm talking about. Everybody know those type of moments. And to hit a shot like that at the buzzer at home, wow.",
        "7": "Well, that guy is not in the League anymore. The other 23 is now on the good side now. That other 23 is gone, so we don't have to worry about that no more. (Smiling).",
        "9": "No. For one, I think they seen that set before. We ran it one time earlier in the season in Indiana right before the All-Star break, and I was able to get a foul on Danny Granger. Rashard Lewis played it perfect. He stood tall, got in Mo's way and dropped it. If you watch the replay, Rashard Lewis even got a contest on the shot when I got up, but just a little bit too late. I mean, they played it perfect. It is just a good shot. It is a good shot. (Smiling). The same way we guard Rashard, when Rashard hit that 3, we guarded it perfect. Good players or great players just make good shots, man.",
        "10": "I wouldn't say put one ahead of the other. That was a great performance also from us as a team, from me as an individual. Tonight was another good performance by me as an individual and us as a team. That's a shot that you will see for a long time, you know? You watch classic games and you see Jordan hit game winners and you go all the way back, Jerry West hitting game winners, and Mattie Johnson going across the lane and hitting the jump hook against Boston. You see all these type of shots, man, always be played even when the game has left you as an individual. Hopefully I can stick my foot in that category with Magic and Jerry West and Jordan and all these other guys that made spectacular plays on the biggest stage in the world.",
        "11": "It's something I will probably do after I'm done playing the game of basketball, man. I don't take time to look at what I do as an individual while I'm still playing this team game. When I'm done and retired and I'm gone away from the game, I'm by myself, my family, my kids, I can look back on what I did as an individual. As long as I have 14 teammates, I will never look upon what I do as an individual. That's not how I approach the game.",
        "13": "Honest answer, when I caught it square, it felt great. It was in the air, it even looked like it was going in. But the breaks we have been getting so far -- MO WILLIAMS: Oh, oh, my God. LeBRON JAMES: There was a great chance it wasn't going in. Hedo hit a tough shot over Sasha to take the lead. It was -- I just didn't know. I mean, it was like, you know -- I didn't pray as much as Mo did. (Smiling). MO WILLIAMS: I was praying. LeBRON JAMES: It felt great. It felt great. If it came out -- it is possible I could have missed that, too. But it felt great. I practice those type of things, man. You guys see me every day. You guys see me after the practice. I'm catching, shooting things that may not happen in a game, but, you know, it happened tonight.",
        "15": "No, you didn't. (Smiling). No. As a kid, you wouldn't leave the gym until you made it, though. As a kid, you would do the five, four, three, two, one. And if you missed 20 in a row, you wasn't allowed to leave the gym until you finally made that shot. I was always Jordan when I made that shot, because in my era growing up Mike was always the one who made those five-to-one game winners, the light goes off and the crowd goes crazy. I wanted to be Mike when I did those things. I got that out of my bag of Michael Jordan tricks, I guess.",
        "18": "The first thing we need to do is realize that we are not going to blow this team out. When we get leads and they make a run, we just can't get down on ourselves. We have to continue to play. The best thing Orlando has, they have matchup -- they have matchup problems. They create matchup problems with Rashard being at the four, they create matchup players. Very good player, very talented. We have to understand that every possession matters. We cannot take a possession off, and if we have a scheme, we cannot break down because every time you break down against a really good team, they make you play. Just like we would do if a team breaks down against us, we are ready to hit the road. It has been a while. We look forward to it."

        "4": "It doesn't. Every game we play, we go out and try to win every game. We are looking forward to it tomorrow.",
        "5": "I think we did a pretty good job of it last night. We watched the game. For the most part, when a guy has it going like that -- I mean, we was up two points. And if Rashard missed that 3, we aren't having that type of conversation. It is tough. You know, it is tough sometimes because you got the flow of the game and (indiscernible) has it going like that, you have rhythm. But at the same time, you keep missing it. You have to try to balance it sometimes.",
        "6": "It is going to be a long series, we believe. We got to approach every game like it is the last. We are just going to go out and play.",
        "7": "Mo is that type of guy. Last night he didn't feel like he did enough. I really think he did. He is hard on himself and that's good.",
        "8": "He played a great game. He didn't shoot the ball particularly well from the field, but his overall game was good.",
        "9": "Got to stay hydrated. It is long, mentally and physically draining. I was doing the jumps and all those types of things. Hopefully after last night -- with nine days of layoffs, you can not simulate 40,000-plus fans. My body just didn't adjust well last night but I'm okay.",
        "10": "No, a lot of water. I don't drink Gatorade.",
        "11": "Like I said, we come out shooting like that, it is going to be tough to win. We know those guys are going to shoot a high percentage in the paint. A lot of the other guys played great.",
        "12": "I think (inaudible) did a great job. We made a few mistakes getting the rebounds that needed to be put back. We didn't have one block last night. That was -- I mean, that shows how well offensively we played. He is a great player. Not many guys that can stop him in the low post. He had it going. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "Is this one you feel -- you talked before the game about Denver let one get away, did you guys let one get away in Game 1?",
        "1": "LeBron, you limped throughout the game. You limped at the end of the game. Do you have any concern you won't be 100 percent for game 2? Why or why not?",

        "4": "49 points, 8 assists, 6 rebounds, 60 percent from the floor. What else can you do to help the team to win? It looks like you had one of the best games in the playoffs.",

        "6": "LeBron, you said, hey, it is a long series and we'll adjust. Take us through that mental process over the next couple days. How do you guys get yourselves in that place for Game 2?",

        "9": "LeBron, could you foresee some change-up in the rotation maybe to get Sasha in for some of the defensive matchups in the next game? And also can you speak to the very last play, to the tip ball, did you guys just draw that up right in the moment? You didn't have a time-out there.",
        "10": "LeBron, you guys haven't really faced much adversity in this post-season, you do know. Can a little bit of that be good, though?",
        "11": "LeBron, do you think the cramps, do you think it may have had anything to do with the long layoff?",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "This is -- we had a good chance to win Game 1, but it was great plays made by both teams down the stretch. Two good teams continuing to execute down the stretch. It definitely hurt, but we got to adjust. Like we said before, a series is not won or lost in one game. It is a good start for them. We just have to make adjustments and get ready for Game 2.",
        "1": "I'm not injured. Just caught a few cramps. That comes from maybe a little bit of dehydration. So I got to make sure I keep my fluids up for the next few days. I'm not hurt.",
        "2": "Not an ankle, not a knee. I'm fine now. Just sometimes if you ever -- if you ever played sports before and you catch a cramp, your body will tell you when you are ready to move. If you try to move before your body tells you to move, it is going to hurt. I just got to stay a little more hydrated throughout these next few days.",
        "4": "Well, my statistics don't mean anything when it ends in a loss. If I can do something else to help our team win, I'm going to do that. What I did is try to give us an opportunity to win. I tried to put us in the right position to win. That's all I can do as an individual. But you try to -- you got to find a way to will games away sometimes when they get away or continue with the same energy you had throughout the whole game. Tonight my individual performance means nothing, you know, because we didn't win the game.",
        "5": "Him being 6'10\", he can see over a lot of defense. He can still see over some of the guards or see over me sometimes when we are blitzing his pick-and-roll. He had to really -- he had a really all-around solid game. He adjusts in the second half, found some things that helped them win the game.",
        "6": "We will prepare just like we do after a win. You make an adjustment. You try to play a little bit harder on the defensive end. For a team shooting 55 percent on our court in a game is unacceptable for all of us. We know that. That's not how we play basketball and that's not how we are going to win. We should have lost giving a team 55 percent from the field. So we are going to make adjustments tomorrow. We are going to watch some film. We are not going to add no more pressure on us than we need to be. Just go out there and play.",
        "7": "I mean, offensively we were stagnant at times, maybe because I felt the hot hand. I got back to the one-on-one play that I had in the past. But I felt I had it going individually. But we only had five turnovers as a team. It is not like we were not playing basketball the right way. We missed some really good shots, some easy shots, we made shots. We shot 48 percent from the field offensively, so for the most part that's a pretty good game when you have 19 assists and only 5 turnovers. MO WILLIAMS: I want to add to that last one. I don't think that him going one-on-one was the factor. I think he had it going. That's part of our offense, for him to attack his man. I think the key -- the key -- the biggest key to the game was myself. Myself was the key. I have to take pressure off that guy. I'm looking at the stats and I'm looking at Dwight and I'm looking at Rashard and I'm looking at Hedo, and those three guys was terrific tonight. And I look at myself, 6-19, LeBron is 20-30 from the field. I don't care, he can go one-on-one all he wants. I got 19 shots still. It wasn't him.",
        "9": "I think Sasha can be really good for us. Mentally if he is in tune with the game plan, he can give us some big minutes. His athleticism, his length, being 6'6\", 6'7\", he can help us. But the last play, Mo wanted the last shot, you know. He told me to tip it to him, he was going to take the last shot. We went with it. Almost went in.",
        "10": "I think it is always good. Nobody said it was going to be easy. It's one game, and if we just look at it and just one game and we just move on to the next game, then we'll be fine. If we think the world is coming down on our heads, then, you know, we are going to get beat pretty bad in Game 2. So like I said before, we always have been a one game or, you know, one team. That's our attitude. So win, lose or draw, you move on to the next.",
        "11": "It may have. Because I caught some cramps, too, before in Game 1 of the Atlanta series with the layoff that we had. You can never simulate practice or scrimmaging during practice because you can't add 20,000 fans, you can't add the lights, you can't add that type of atmosphere. With all the sweating that goes on during the course of the game, the mental and physical pounding that you take throughout the course of a game, it is easy for you to catch cramps. So it has something to do with it.",
        "12": "That's called reverse psychology. Just trying to get his guys basically saying you guys need to play a little harder and don't worry about his name, just -- you guys are in the NBA for a reason. I got to just continue with what I got to do to help us win ball games. You guys hear Stan all the time in time-outs, you know how he is. He's funny (smiling).",
        "13": "Rashard hit a big shot. Couldn't believe he took the shot, but that's him. If you look at any other series, if you look at statistics and you guard the stat sheets and know percentages and things like that and guy's tendencies, Orlando, they like to go for the win on the road. Hedo took a 3 in the Philly series with a tie game. And Rashard, you just need a little bit of air space to knock down a 3. The play was drawn up to me to make a play, to go quickly, to give us a chance to get an offensive rebound, and I was able to drive. And my man failed, so it kind of got me off balance. So I drove and seen Mo, I saw one guy guard Mo and Delonte. Just like any other play, any other time, I see that happen, I made the skip to Mo. I know Mo wanted to shoot it bad, but his basketball instinct say if a man comes to you, swing, swing. Delonte, same spot to put us up one, had a good look at it, just didn't fall.",

I wanted to be aggressive and try to get the hole to get the lay-up.  And when I seen those bigs coming, I didn't want to lay the ball up.  They would have definitely made a play and tried to block it, so I was able to go strong and able to dunk it through.",
        "1": "No, I just wanted to win the basketball game.  They beat up on us pretty bad last year in Las Vegas, and as the East, we didn't want to allow that to happen.  We wanted to try to win. We did a good job of executing in the fourth quarter.  Ray hit some big shots.  Some of the biggest shots of the game, and he kept it flowing.  You know, we put the finishing touch on it, and it was a dunk.",
        "2": "Oh well, we know we're still not going to get the respect we should get.  That's never been a problem for us.  We don't care.  We just go out and play.  We're always going to be the third or fourth or fifth best team in the Eastern Conference. You know, we still go out there and win ballgames and we know when the postseason happens, you know, you've got to come get it from us, because we're very good.",
        "3": "I mean, to add the MVP trophy with the win means a lot to me.  I played well, and I helped our team win the ballgame.  It really means a lot to go out there and perform the way I was able to do in front of the fans of New Orleans.  In front of my family, and for the Eastern Conference because we really wanted this win.  We came out victorious.",
        "4": "Well, this was one of the most competitive ones.  The one in Houston was really competitive also.  But you've probably seen a lot of guys faces going through the fourth quarter how competitive guys wanted to be, and, you know, who wanted the ballgame.  We were able to make a couple more plays had than the Western team down the stretch.  D Wade had an unbelievable block on Dirk, and Ray hit some big shots.  We were down and the game was tied.  And I was able to put the finishing touch on it with the dunk and kept the momentum going for us. So competitive-wise, it was the best one.  As fans and everybody that watched the game I think would think the same thing. End of FastScripts"

        "1": "Yeah, I told him he should have spent 30 minutes in the Western Conference meetings, and 30 minutes in the Eastern Conference meeting.  He's with us right now at halftime, but he might go play for the West.",
        "2": "It's going to be tough because of how the Eastern Conference has gotten better with the addition of how Boston recreated themselves.  Detroit is always going to be better.  Orlando's much better.  They've had some off-season acquisitions. It's going to be tough for us.  It's going to be a challenge.  We have to mentally prepare ourselves to go out there and play the game of basketball the right way.",
        "3": "We'll see.  We're going to let the game do the talking.  It doesn't matter who you have on paper, you've got to go out there and win a seven-game series.",
        "4": "I thought Hedo Turkoglu in the Eastern Conference played well, to make the All-Star team and he's not a part of it.  He played great basketball for the third best team in the East.  He played great basketball.",
        "5": "Most definitely easier to take in.  It was erratic my first year.  I was excited being my first year.  I'm kind of used to it now, but at the same time I'm always excited to get around these great athletes.",
        "6": "This year has been most surprising in-season and off-season we've had in the NBA in a long time.  With the Lakers dealing Pau, and Miami, and Phoenix dealing Shaq and Shawn Marion, and the off-season acquisitions.  You look at Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett going to Boston, and Rashard Lewis going to Orlando.  There's been so many new faces.  I mean, same faces, new teams.  At times it can be hard to keep up with. So it's been good for the NBA.  And hopefully, you know, it's been good.",
        "7": "You know, you always want to get better.  Especially with me.  I'm a competitor, I want to get better.  Hopefully we can continue to get better.  If not, we're going to stick to our guns that we have, and get ready for the second half of the season. End of FastScripts"

        "3": "Can you just talk about how much you basically have carried this franchise, but you still need help; you can't do everything by yourself?  What needs to be done maybe supporting cast-wise, and did you feel heavy pressure during the series?",

        "6": "For you, you said you're a no-excuses team, but now that this series is over, this season is over, how much maybe was fatigue a factor for you, very uncharacteristic of you, 23 turnovers in the four games, shooting 33 percent.  Now that it's over, was fatigue a factor?",

        "0": "It definitely could have been better.  It could have been better in order for us to win.  You know, if I don't play well, our team is not going to have a good chance to win.  You know, I've got a lot of things to work on to get better for next year.",
        "1": "There's no one thing that I want to focus on intensively, it's just everything.  I need to definitely get better, and once I get better, our team will automatically get better, and I know that.  I have to do everything that I've done well and try to improve in order for us to be a better team next year.",
        "2": "I'm not sure.  You know, you're definitely disappointed.  I'm not disappointed in our effort the last two games, not at all.  I think we played well.  We definitely just faced a better team in this series, simple as that.",
        "3": "I really think the team we have now is good enough to win a championship, and I really stressed that from the beginning.  It just shows we went up against a better team, simple as that.  We went up against a better team in this series, and everybody has to be better coming into next season.  I have to be ten times better.  Our team has to be ten times better.  As individuals, if we all put in the work this summer and come to training camp next year, our level automatically rises.",
        "4": "I'm just excited about what happened with our team this year.  You know, we gave it all.  We did what we said, made it to the championship, try to win the championship.  We won the Eastern Conference Championship.  We wanted to win the big thing, but when we look back on it, hopefully we can be satisfied, or not satisfied, but happy with what we have done.",
        "5": "I didn't.  I didn't want to turn around at all and look at it, but I've seen other teams win the title before, me watching on TV, so I know what they were doing.  But I didn't turn around and look at it (smiling).  I didn't want to look at it.",
        "6": "I don't think so.  I felt great throughout the whole season.  Everyone at this point is -- everyone is injured at this point, everyone is a little fatigued.  It's not an excuse.  I definitely felt good coming into this series, and I think the defensive intensity and some of the things they did kept me off guard and kept the team off guard.  The turnovers are uncharacteristic of what happened.  It was a lot of unforced things, me losing the ball or me making bad passes.  It's all things I can control, and I wasn't able to do that.",
        "7": "We have to be better.  Me, as an individual, I have to be much better on and off the court, and that will carry our team to higher levels.  I think it starts with me first and then it will trickle down to everybody else.",
        "8": "I'm not sure.  We haven't really talked about it.  You know, we went up against a better team.  We know the Spurs is definitely the better team in this series.  They played like it.  They never got rattled when we made runs.  They never sped up.  They played their own tempo, and they kept us off balance.  I think we learned that as good as we thought we was, there was still a team out there that was better than us.",
        "9": "I was just basically congratulating him on a wonderful season, on his championship.  He's definitely a great player and he has a great supporting cast around him.  I think it's great.  If I couldn't do it, why not Tim Duncan?  He's definitely a very good player, and he definitely brings out the best in his teammates.  I think I kind of want to do the same thing and try to do the same thing with my teammates, so we're kind of the same player, me in the perimeter, him in the post.",

      "questions": {
        "0": "Peyton Manning was in the crowd last night, and he's always reading defenses at the line and trying to figure things out.  How much do you feel kind of like Peyton Manning with what you've seen so far and what the Spurs are doing to you defensively?",
        "1": "Just to follow up, in the low post yesterday, it seemed a couple of times you had one-on-one coverage and you kind of waited to see where that second guy was coming from.  Any thought of maybe attacking earlier as opposed to waiting?",
        "2": "You had a lot of good looks that just didn't fall and it's been happening throughout this series, other than just obviously your luck changing, what can you do to make those jumpers go on?",
        "3": "That last shot, the three-pointer, the coach said we talked to the official afterwards and Bruce didn't touch him.  You were on the replay saying I was fouled.  Can you talk about what you thought happened in that shot?",
        "4": "In San Antonio in two games you did not play your best, did not score the points you're used to scoring and the team lost.  Last night you scored more, more active, got more things done but the team lost.  You talk about reading defenses.  Is it time to just let your talent and instinct take over in Game 4, backs against the wall, and drive more or try to impose your will more on this game?",
        "5": "Following up on that, obviously everybody knows the history of being down 0-3, but how do you guys have to approach the game tomorrow?  Do you have to come in just like it's one game, we win this game, and anything can happen?",
        "6": "Can you just describe what it feels like and what you see when Bruce Bowen is on you?  Essentially what is it like to be defended by him?",
        "7": "Can you describe the differences in the coverage schemes that you saw with Detroit and what San Antonio is trying to do to you?",
        "8": "Especially in that case, weak side ball movement is critical, isn't it, against these guys?",
        "9": "I watched you shoot for 31 minutes early yesterday, around 6:10, 6:15.  Is there ever an indication of how your perimeter game might be in the course of a game?",
        "10": "To piggy-back off an earlier question, only one team has been swept in The Finals the last 11, 12 years.  How much does pride kick into that distinction?",
        "11": "You're finding out how difficult it is to win a championship.  From a player's standpoint, how do you view what the Spurs have been able to do over the last nine years?",
        "12": "How often does Coach Brown kind of reference them and bring them up as a model with whatever you guys are doing?",
        "13": "72-70, you guys have the ball.  Did you not hear Mike Brown, the video showed him jumping up and down screaming at the top of his lungs for a time-out.  With the noise and everything, did you guys not hear him at all?",
        "14": "Just to follow up, the Detroit series, the two you lost there, you came away with some confidence because you played them down to the wire and had a chance to win.  Even though you're down 3-0 are you taking some positives away from yesterday?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "You know, definitely they're doing a great job.  You know, I was definitely trying to read to see what they're doing at a particular time of the game.  You know, you see one guy, you might see two and now you can see another one.  So it's definitely a collective defensive attacks that they're putting on me and putting on our team.",
        "1": "You know, I've got to read the defense first.  I've always done that.  I'd go on two dribbles and they'd go on the double-team.  We had some great looks, we just didn't knock them down.  All the shots we took from the outside was good looks.  We've just got to step in and make them.",
        "2": "Just got to continue to take them, feel confident about it and go up there and take that shot.  You know, I know I can make them, I think my teammates know they can make outside shots, we've just got to continue to take them.",
        "3": "Definitely I thought there was some contact, but we don't want to try to make that as an excuse of why we lost the game or if it could change the game.  We had opportunities where we could have made shots before that and not put ourselves in a position to be down three with five seconds to play.  I think we all know there was some contact, but that's neither here nor there, so we don't get involved in that.",
        "4": "I play my game.  My game is what I've been doing.  I see a double-team, I get a ball up.  If I don't see a double-team I try to attack and get into the lane.  If I've got an outside shot, I'll take it.  I can't change my game, what got us here.  Everything I've been doing is the reason why we're here, and our team, everything we've been doing, is the reason we're here.  We don't want to try to change anything but we know our backs are up against the wall and we have to try to win Game 4.",
        "5": "Well, you have to.  We have no choice but to win or the season is over and there's a new champion.  We have to come out with the mindset to take one game at a time and just continue to try to win four in a row.  Hopefully we can do that.",
        "6": "I think individually he's great.  I think what also helps him is the guys that's behind him.  You know, it's not one guy in this league that can play defense on an individual by himself.  I think as a team they're very good, which allows him to pressure, which allows him to do a lot of things that some other defenders can't do because they don't have that back line behind him.  When you have a seven-footer in Tim Duncan and Oberto and Robert Horry, and you have Manu that closes in when they try to drive, it allows his one-on-one defense to be a lot more pressure, that much more physical because he knows he has that help behind him.  Individually he's great, but those guys behind him also helps him.",
        "7": "Well, I think Detroit, they tried to drop a lot of pick-and-rolls and tried to weak me left on the top.  I wasn't as aggressive around the perimeter, which allowed me to get into the lane a little bit.  I think San Antonio is not allowing me to come off screens without seeing another body, simple as that.  I'm seeing one or two, and if I'm getting around two I'm seeing another third guy.  They definitely have picked up in intensity, and we have to be able to exploit that.  If they're going to put two guys on me, we have to be able to do something on the backside, and if I get a ball, I have to be even more aggressive on trying to get it back when we're swinging from one side to another.",
        "8": "Well, definitely.  We've had opportunities where I've kicked it out of the post and nobody has had an opportunity to swing, swing or we took that first look.  Maybe we needed to swing it from one side to another to get something on the backside and therefore rotate.  I think that would help.",
        "9": "Well, it's just kind of a mental thing trying to get ready and get prepared for the game.  You know those shots are not going to be there during the course of a game because you have defenders guarding you, of course, but I think just getting a warm-up, just getting a workout before the game mentally prepares you for the game definitely.",
        "10": "We gave ourselves a chance to win last night, and I've always said, and I said all year and all throughout the postseason, you give yourself a chance to win you can't feel down about it.  Defensively we were very active last night.  Offensively we got some great looks, we just weren't falling.  I was able to get into the lane a couple times and missed a couple bunnies.  We don't want to get swept, of course.  We're not even thinking about that.  We're thinking about winning a game and continuing to try to win and win a championship.",
        "11": "It's awesome.  I think they have a dynasty already at work, and I think Coach Popovich and that staff and being able to get the No. 1 pick in Duncan has really helped their franchise and the pieces here and the pieces there to make that team a championship team.  They don't have the greatest athletes in the world, they don't have the greatest shooters in the world, but they have probably the greatest team in the world, and that's what this sport is all about.  It's not about an individual.  It's not like tennis, it's not like golf.  You have to have one unit.  You have to have everybody on the same page at the same time to win basketball games.",
        "12": "With him being a part of that franchise, why shy away from it?  When you want to be the best, you want to try to mirror image the best, and they're definitely the best team in our league at this point in time.  You want to try to do as close or exactly to what they do.  And it's going to be tough because they've been together for so long, but at the same time, you want to try to just take a little bit of something from there and try to input it into your system, definitely.",
        "13": "No, if they would have heard him we would have called a time-out.  The time-out looking back at it when we got the ball, didn't seem like he was calling a time-out.  I think he was trying to communicate more to the refs than to us, you know, and it's -- it's no one's fault but we didn't know.  Look at that, we call a time-out there, then we don't have the two to try to tie the game up at the end, so it kind of worked in our favor.",
        "14": "We took some confidence from Game 2 to Game 3.  We played with that last night.  We had a lot of energy, defensively we played extremely well.  We didn't allow them to get whatever shot they wanted like in San Antonio.  At the end we gave ourselves a chance to win.  We still feel confident.  It's all about the first team getting No. 4.  They're definitely closer than we are, but at the same time, the series is not over until somebody hits four. End of FastScripts"

        "2": "Incidental contact.  It didn't affect my shot.  I had a good look at it and I missed.",
        "3": "Oh, absolutely.  I had been aggressive in the fourth quarter.  I was definitely going to get it back from Andy, but Andy made a good move.  He just over-shot it.  I definitely wanted to try to get a good look at it or give my teammate a better look at it, but it was just miscommunication.",
        "4": "Well, tonight was definitely a couple.  I didn't think that went my way.  I had an offensive foul, but I didn't think that was a foul.  Their defense was definitely good, and they're definitely making me work for everything I do.",
        "5": "Well, everybody has to still believe.  You know, it is the first of four games, but we dug ourselves a big hole, and we have to come out aggressive and just continue to play hard.  We gave ourselves a chance to win tonight and that's all we can ask for.",
        "6": "Absolutely.  We can't live on history, but at the same time we have dug ourselves a big hole, and we know that.  We have to come out and try to win four straight games.",
        "7": "This is all about them.  They played very good defense.  They played elbows and boxes and if I'm coming off someone that's there and I have to swing the ball to a teammate or I come off a pick-and-roll and they're there again.  It's all about me not trying to force anything and to try to go for it when I can.  I did a good job of not forcing it tonight, got into the lane and missed a couple bunnies that rimmed in and rimmed out.  Definitely I found some creases tonight.",
        "8": "It was definitely good for them because Manu struggled, Tony struggled, and Tim Duncan didn't shoot the ball well from the field, so Bruce definitely kept them in the game in the first half hitting three big threes, and defensively he's very good.  So he definitely helped them.",
        "9": "I'm not surprised on how tough it is.  I kind of envisioned it being tough.  I think the Eastern Conference Finals was tough, and I knew it was going to pick up another level.  I think our team senses that, also.  You know, the experience factor, we don't like to make any excuse, but it definitely played a part in this Finals against a world power team in the Spurs.",
        "10": "Definitely.  I think Coach Pop and their defensive staff has put in a great defensive plan against me.  Any little crease I find they're still having guys coming over me, and if I do finish they make me finish over bodies.  I really expect that and I love the challenge.  It's fun going out there and seeing different defenses and trying a pick here and a pick there.  You've got to give all the props to the Spurs and all the props to Coach Pop and his staff.  They've done so far a wonderful job. End of FastScripts"

        "6": "You've seen Tony Parker for a couple of games.  You were guarding him tonight.  Do you have any sense of what you guys can do to keep him out of the paint?",

        "8": "The big three for the Spurs, they are the big three, but can you talk about Robert Horry and the veteran presence?  I mean, he just did so many things tonight to kind of get this victory for him?",

        "0": "We're definitely still confident.  It doesn't matter if you lose by 1 or lose by 30 with us.  A loss is a loss, and we've been down 2-0 before in this situation, so we have to find a way to bring the intensity that we did in the fourth quarter tonight and carry it on to Game 3.",
        "1": "I don't know, I think the fourth quarter we just realize that it's a pride thing then, and we don't want to get blown out.  We're here for a reason, and it becomes a pride thing in the fourth quarter when you're down so many points.",
        "2": "I think it's just an upgrade from series to series, you know, from the first round to the second round, Conference Finals, and then to The Finals it's an upgrade.  It doesn't matter who it is, the intensity level automatically picks up.  The team is better.  It doesn't matter if it's Detroit or the Spurs.  Every round gets a little harder.",
        "3": "I think the intensity is a big difference.  Like I said, I don't -- you give the Spurs a lot of credit, but everyone knows that each round picks up, and the team picks up.  You get better after you win one series.  You get better when you win the Conference Finals and get to The Finals.  You get better as a team, and the intensity definitely picks up.",
        "4": "It's not a good thing for me.  I can't remember the last time I didn't play 40-plus minutes.  I got two quick fouls and it definitely didn't work in our team's favor.  I wanted to be out there to try to help my team win, and being in early foul trouble definitely hurt us.",
        "5": "We can play better.  We can play harder.  It shows, the difference the first three quarters or the first half compared to the second half.  At one point we were shooting 57 percent from the field, and that hasn't been us.  We have to find a way to pick up our intensity and carry on what happened in the fourth quarter into the rest of the game.",
        "6": "I don't know (laughing)  you know, he's very good, probably the second best point guard we've played in this postseason.  Jason Kidd is one, I think Tony Parker is two.  No matter what you do he's going to find a way to get into the paint.  He can finish over big guys, finish over small guys.  They have a great one in Tony Parker for sure.",
        "7": "No, that's kind of a cop-out.  We don't want to go zone.  We're a man team, we have to man up and try to keep him out of the paint.  We have to make our best effort.  We made him take a lot of jump shots tonight, which he made.  He made a three.  I think when he's shooting the ball as well as he did tonight there's no way you can stop him.",
        "8": "He definitely did a great job defensive, came up with a lot of blocked shots, rebounded the ball extremely well on the offensive and defensive rebound.  He's been here before, and it's nothing new to him.  It doesn't matter if he's out there for five minutes or for 25 minutes, he's definitely going to give his best effort, and he was definitely a spark off the bench.",
        "9": "It's definitely going to be a great experience I think for all Cleveland fans, for northeast Ohio, for the whole state of Ohio.  It's going to be something that hasn't been experienced in a long, long time for our city, for our fans.  It's going to be electrifying.  If you're not there, I expect you to try to get there.",
        "10": "No (laughter).",
        "11": "I just think he understands how to play the game of basketball, and he knows that he's going to get some great looks, but he knows if the guys run him off the three-point line, he knows how to finish in the lane.  He's getting better every game, every series, and it's great to see him grow and watch him continue to grow.  I think he's definitely one of the best players on our team. End of FastScripts"

Can you tell us a little bit about how your approach or mindset changes from Game 1 to 2 to 3 as the series progresses?  It seems like something changes with you.  Take us through that process that you go through.",

        "10": "I hope this is a question you haven't answered before, too.  In terms of your shooting, do you think you have a tendency to fade to your left, which flattens your trajectory?  Do you have a tendency to do that?  And with your physical jumping ability, why don't you like go up straight more, just straight in front of the defensive guy and shoot it right in his eye because you can jump over anybody?",

        "15": "You've faced double-teams before, but going into Game 2 knowing that you're going to face double and triple-teams, how is that going to change your approach to the way you do things offensively going into this game?",
        "16": "Since you gave us such a good answer on the Sopranos, what was the last movie you saw and give us a quick critique of it?",

        "1": "It's just mentally and just trying to read the defense as much as possible and just try to be better the next game.  I've done a great job of preparing myself from one game to another, and I definitely feel like it's going to be a bounce-back game for me tomorrow night.",
        "2": "(Laughing) that's a great question.  I did have my girlfriend TiVo(r) the Sopranos definitely so when I get home I'll be able to watch it.  But I think I'll be more focused on Tony Parker, even though I am a fan of Tony Soprano.",
        "3": "Me and my guys have definitely sat down and think about it.  My friends think that either the Feds are going to come and get him or he's going to make friends with the Feds and maybe snitch on a lot of people, or he's going to be whacked, which I don't think is going to happen.  I hope that he's just able to get away and not worry about nothing (laughter).",
        "4": "I'm serious, I'm a big Sopranos fan, and this is the first time I finally got a question which is not the same question I've been hearing all year.  I appreciate that.  That was awesome because I told you I'm pretty tired of answering the same questions, so I appreciate it.",
        "5": "I hope not.",
        "6": "No, absolutely not.  Congratulations.  I didn't know that.  Congratulations to him and his family.  That's awesome.  I'm expecting any day.  Well, I'm not (laughter).  That would be kind of weird, but Savannah is expecting any day.  I think it's a great time for his family, and it's not going to take away from nothing that he does on the basketball court.",
        "7": "No, we're just going to -- she's going to just play it by ear.  Whatever happens, happens.  We're very excited about it, and we can't wait.",
        "8": "Just like I said in the last series, I think they're very good when you allow them to set up in the half court defensively, and that's the same with Detroit.  Just try to get up and down the court a little bit quicker and try to get some earlier looks on the shot clock where they're not set as much.  Try and make the easy pass, don't go for the hard pass.  They're very good at shrinking the floor and closing out some of my shooters.  We have to do a better job of dribble penetrating, getting to the lane and then kicking out instead of just making the hard pass from one side of the court to the other side.",
        "9": "Offensively and defensively we're a lot better.  We did play pretty good defense, but offensively were weren't sharp at all.  I wasn't sharp offensively, and that trickles down to the rest of our team.  If I'm not sharp then it's going to be very tough for us to win ball games.  Mentally we had a great practice yesterday and we're looking forward to having another one today.",
        "10": "Are you a shooting coach?",
        "11": "I'm looking for one (laughter).  I've been told that before.  It's just sometimes it's natural for me to fade.  You know, I think a lot of my shots go in when I fade, a lot of them go in when I jump straight up, so it's something I'm definitely going to work on and get better with.  But trajectory and all that stuff, I don't know.",
        "12": "I don't know (smiling).  I just think --",
        "13": "It's not easy at all.  That's why I'm not sitting out there, I guess.",
        "14": "He's definitely a team-oriented guy, and he communicates well with his teammates, and that's off the court.  You know, it's definitely family first with him and basketball second, and any time you get an opportunity to sit down with a guy like that -- you know, we have a guy like that on our team, Eric Snow, who really cares about everything else besides basketball because basketball is going to take care of itself.  You really respect a guy like that who really respects your family and things that you do off the court, community service, things like that and things besides basketball.  I think that means a lot to a person like me, and I really respect Bruce and Eric being open like that.",
        "15": "Well, you definitely look at it and see how you can attack it a little bit better.  But it's not going to make me that much more passive.  I've definitely faced double-teams and triple-teams throughout this postseason, so I have to do a better job of trying to attack the double-team early and see if I can swing it to the other side to a teammate that can make a play, also. We got into too many late shot clocks in Game 1, which is not good for us.  We don't work well when we get into the shot clock down at 3 and 2 on the clock, and it makes us make bad plays.  We just have to do a better job of trying to attack the double-team and being a little bit more aggressive getting to the lane.",
        "16": "The last movie I saw was -- what was it?  I don't remember.  Spiderman III was the last movie I seen.  It was a little bit too romantic, but it was very good.  It was very long, but it was a little bit too romantic for me, I guess.",

        "1": "Tony Parker last night had 12 buckets, 11 were in the lane.  Why is it so hard to keep him from getting to the rim even though you know that's his intention?",
        "2": "I preface this by saying I know you're 22 and your focus is basketball, but on the larger issue of social issues, what does your gut tell you when you're done playing basketball, do you think you're going to be more Muhammad Ali or more Michael Jordan?",
        "3": "You talked the other day about being a quick learner.  What do you do between games to get better and study and make the adjustments that you need to make?",
        "4": "In the Detroit series one of the things you talked about adjusting was being more aggressive to the hoop.  Is there anything --",
        "5": "I just talked to Z.  He said he was happy with the looks he got last night, he just didn't make them.  Do you feel the same way?  Was it just missing shots you normally make?",
        "6": "How much of that was due to 21 standing back there and he's kind of the eraser if somebody gets by their guy?",
        "7": "What was the similarities and differences for the Spurs' defense that they did on you?",
        "8": "There's been a lot of talk of lack of scoring, but how much about the turnovers bother you?",
        "9": "At 22 years old there's some things you haven't gone through.  I noticed the last three opening games of the series you did not have your game.  Do you see yourself kind of feeling your way through every series as you get through your first Conference Finals and in our your first NBA Finals?",
        "10": "Have you learned from the past two Game 1s and the way you've rebounded?  You've kind of been there, done this by now, right?",
        "11": "Under normal circumstances if you struggled in a game you'd come out aggressive the next game, try to establish yourself a little quicker.  In your case, you're coming out against one, two and three guys eye-balling you all the time.  How exactly do you handle that?",
        "12": "You guys have had a world of playoff experience the last two years.  How would you describe the mindset of the team coming off last night going forward into the second game?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "It definitely played a lot, us never being a part of it, but that's not an excuse for us, because we've been in games in the Eastern Conference Finals we've never been apart of and we didn't make an excuse.  It's something we've been able to adjust throughout the course of a series.  That's going to be the biggest thing to try to, adjust to Game 2 from Game 1 and get better.",
        "1": "I guess if every team in the NBA knew the answer he wouldn't be able to lead the league in points in paint all the time.  He's very good, he's very quick, and he knows where he wants to get on the court.  It's very difficult, but basically we're going to have to challenge ourselves to keep him out of the paint.  But at the same time, I think their team does a great job of executing some of the defensive schemes against him which allows him to get to the paint.  We'll have to contain him a little bit better.",
        "2": "I'm going to try to be more of LeBron James.  When I say that, I just want to hopefully end my career the best way that I want to end it and then just try to be more of a businessman, which I can try to set up things for my family and try to pass the word on to younger kids and to older adults, I guess, in the business side of things.  I've definitely been working that right now to try to brace myself for when the NBA career is over because I know it doesn't last forever.",
        "3": "For me, I watch a lot of film.  I watched the game last night when I got back to the room, and I'm probably going to watch it again tonight to see throughout the course of the game what they tried to do defensively against me, and offensively, also.  I think I'm going to make little adjustments today at practice because they're probably going to -- Coach is probably going to simulate some of the things they did against me today at practice and I'll be a better player tomorrow or Sunday.",
        "4": "Sometimes it's about being more aggressive and then sometimes it's about reading things and mentally trying to prepare yourself the best way to try to counter some of the things they do defensively.  You know, they may have caught some of our guys off guard, including myself at times during the course of Game 1, and I think we've played enough playoff games to know how to make the adjustment the next game.",
        "5": "I think it was a little bit of both.  I think if no one is on the court you make those kind of shots but you've got to give their defense a lot of credit.  But at the same time, we definitely struggled from the field last night missing a lot of shots that we normally make.  I think Z missed a lot of lay-ups that he usually makes, I missed some pull-ups that I normally make, but we don't take nothing away from their defense.",
        "6": "He's definitely a good defender.  It's easy to -- I don't want to say it's easy, but it's great insurance when you have a guy like that behind you that protects the lane like he does.  It gives them the opportunity to get out and run.",
        "7": "Well, the similarities, that's been happening to me all playoffs, they've double and triple-teamed me at times and made me give the ball up and tried to deny me from getting it back.  I'm going to have to make the easy pass and rely on my teammates a little bit more, which I'm going to do and have done throughout the postseason.  I think it wasn't anything different that they did, I just think they did a great job of rotating once I gave the ball up to some of my shooters on the backside, not to allow them to set their feet and get off good looks.",
        "8": "That bothers me more than anything.  The six turnovers that I had is very uncharacteristic of me throughout these postseason.  I've been able to take care of the ball.  I think there was a lot of unforced turnovers, a couple slams from behind, one went off my leg.  So no, the scoring doesn't matter to me.  I think the fact I was able turn the ball over as much as I did which allowed them to get extra possessions hurt me more than anything.",
        "9": "I think so.  The first game I kind of feel my way through it and kind of make an adjustment.  I don't plan to go out there and not shoot the ball well or not score.  I do a great job of adjusting from game to game, and I think my teammates do the same.",
        "10": "Yeah, I guess (smiling).",
        "11": "You know, when you say you want to be a little more aggressive, that doesn't mean aggressive to shoot.  That just means try to be aggressive getting to the lane and making a better shot for your team, or if you have a better shot then go for it.  Aggressiveness doesn't mean you have to shoot every time you get into the lane or you want to force some things.  But it's definitely going to be a point of emphasis for me to try to be aggressive in Game 2, try to get better shots for my teammates where they don't have to worry about a hand in their face and try to get better shots for myself.",
        "12": "We're very confident.  You know, that's why it's a series.  I said last night, it's not the NCAA tournament where you lose one game and you're going home.  This is a series, and we're down 1-0.  We've been in this position before.  We've been down 2-0 and came back and won a series, so it's nothing new to us, but this is definitely a different beast we're playing against.  We don't want to go down 2-0 against this team.  We have to come out and prepare ourselves the best way Sunday and come out and try to win the ballgame. End of FastScripts"

        "6": "Seems like the deeper you go into the playoffs the more people they're sending at you and now it looks like basically you're being played by one, two and three people watching you all the time.  Does it change the game for you?",
        "11": "LeBron, in the Eastern Conference playoffs a lot of the guys who were defending you overplayed you and tried to force you left.  Bruce tried to play you straight up and didn't force you either way.  How did that impact the way you played?",

        "0": "You definitely give a lot of credit to the Spurs.  They definitely played well tonight defensively, offensively.  Some of it was me missing a lot of the shots that I usually make and some of it was the defense that they put on me and on our team in general.  It's like a half and half thing.",
        "1": "We're going to have to make adjustments.  You're coming to Game 1 you don't know what to expect.  We don't know what they're going to run against us offensively.  We've got to make adjustments in Game 2.  A lot of credit to the, they played extremely well defensively.  It's a series.  Things happen.  They're up 1-0 and we'll make adjustments and be ready for Sunday.",
        "2": "It was definitely crowded.  They did a great job of shrinking the floor.  If I went by one guy, another guy stepped up, something I'm going to have to make an adjustment for for Game 2.  I'll definitely be ready to counter some of the things they did defensively.",
        "3": "I didn't play extremely well, definitely.  Not just shooting the ball, but the six turnovers was uncharacteristic of me in the postseason, tried to force a lot of passes in there that looked open at times but really wasn't.  I have to play better, and for us to win, me being the leader of this team, I have to play better in order for us to have a chance to win down the stretch, and my teammates know I'm going to bring my better effort in Game 2.",
        "4": "I feel good.  A lot of shots I took is shots that I make.  They felt pretty good, they just didn't fall for me.  Things like that happen.  You have one off night, but the thing like this is it's not like the NCAA tournament where you have one game and you're out.  We've got to regroup and be ready for Game 2.",
        "5": "Same answer I keep giving.  We don't know.  We haven't put our finger on the third quarter yet.  We did a better job last year in Game 5 and Game 6 of playing great basketball in the third quarter, but once again it caught up with us again.  We don't know what it is but we did a great job of figuring it out.  We're going to do it pretty soon.  We definitely want to get a win on this floor before we go back home.",
        "6": "No, it doesn't.  I know I'm going to see a lot of double teams, at times triple teams.  It's something I've seen before and it's something I've been able to adjust to from game to game and in different series of this postseason.  It's not like I've never seen a double-team or triple-team before, I just have to play better, and I definitely have a better effort on Sunday.",
        "11": "I think defensively he's very good.  He's one of the best defensive players in this league, and the guys behind him help him a lot.  It gives him an opportunity to get up into me and force me into the bigs, and the bigs are very good, Elson and Duncan, of course.  He has a lot behind him.  He doesn't have to do it by himself.  I'm able to go right and left, so there's nothing that I can't do out on the ball court.  I'll just have to make an adjustment and come into Game 2 with a better mindset and try to get a win.",
        "12": "That's definitely a fair assessment and I have to do a better job of trying to recognize that, trying to attack north and south instead of east and west.  They tried to make me dribble out towards the side line.  The bigs did a great job coming off pick-and-rolls, of showing hard and allowing Bruce to get underneath the big, try and attack me coming right underneath the big.  I think our coaching staff is very aware of what was going on, what happened in Game 1.  I think our players are very aware of what happened in Game 1, and we'll make an adjustment.  It's not like we haven't been in this situation before. End of FastScripts"

        "1": "You obviously were in Ohio when the Cavs had all those losing years before they got you.  When was it like watching them and following them during those troubling times and how much pride does it give you to help turn around the franchise the way it has been?",
        "2": "Coach said that Eric Snow talked to you guys from his experience in the NBA Finals.  What did Eric tell you besides the media and the ticket stuff?  What did he tell you to expect in these NBA Finals?",
        "3": "Can you just talk about just the Spurs, what you think about them defensively, and also just the perceived pressure on you for this team to win a championship, you've got to get in there?",
        "4": "Once you did start paying attention to sports history, it obviously stuck because you know a lot about it.  What are your favorite Finals moments?",

        "10": "There's a long list of elite players that have never won an NBA title.  Do you feel like you need to have one to be considered a great?",
        "11": "You've made such a dramatic improvement as a team in the past couple years defensively since Mike Brown took over.  This league is known for glorious offensive talents like yourself.  Has it made you appreciate the last couple years a little bit more, understanding, like, yeah, that is the way you've got to succeed to win titles?",
        "12": "What you just accomplished against Tayshaun Prince, who we know has elevated his offensive game tremendously, what kind of a source of pride did that give you in that series that you pretty much rendered him effectiveless?",

        "16": "So many of the experts are picking against you guys.  Do you kind of feel like you have to have that us-against-the-world kind of mentality going into this series?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, for us it really is.  To everybody else it might not be the next game or next playoff series, but to us it is.  That's how we've approached every game in this postseason, from round 1 all the way from the Eastern Conference Finals and now to The Finals.  That's the way we approach it.  We don't try to make it more than what it is.  It's a basketball game and we have to approach it like that, with our same mindset we've been doing throughout this postseason.",
        "1": "Well, for me growing up it really wasn't bad for me because I wasn't really on professional sports at all.  I didn't know what was going on with professional sports.  I was just trying to play AU basketball and play little league football and things like that.  So it really wasn't a big deal for me.  But as I grew up and started to learn more about it and then being the No. 1 pick to Cleveland and knowing the history about Cleveland sports, it really meant a lot to finally bring home a championship to the city of Cleveland.  You just seen how the fans reacted after.",
        "2": "Just to have fun.  I mean, this is fun times for us, and there should be no reason to add any more pressure onto it.  This is fun times for us, and we've earned it.  We've played just as many games as everybody else in this postseason, so we've definitely earned the right to be here. And at the same time, we have to be mentally focused and approach it like it's business.  It's always been business for us throughout this postseason, and him being the only one as a player, besides Coach Brown, and Danny Ferry being part of the Finals, he knows what it's about, so we listened to his word and we approached him in practice yesterday and we're going to try to do the same today.",
        "3": "I think defensively they're one of the best teams in the NBA.  You know, they work well together on the defensive end.  You know if you beat one guy, another guy steps up.  They've been pretty good throughout the years on the defensive end. But it's no added pressure for me.  There's no added pressure for our team to go out there and try to pressure.  We just know we've got to go out there and play as hard as we can and give ourselves an opportunity to win.  We've definitely been able to do that.",
        "4": "My favorite Finals moment is probably the last shot Michael had in Utah to end the series, thinking that was going to be his last shot ever in the NBA uniform and to retire on top like he did, hitting a game-winner on the road, was definitely my No. 1 favorite moment of watching the NBA Finals.",
        "5": "That was pretty nice, too (laughter).",
        "6": "Me?",
        "7": "Cleveland?  Yeah, that's why we're here (smiling).  We're going to try to do our best to bring it there, absolutely.",
        "8": "No, absolutely not (laughter).",
        "9": "I feel like -- I just feel like a veteran.  I don't say I don't feel 22, I'm not hurting or anything like that, my body is not down or anything like that.  I just feel like when you look at a guy like Daniel Gibson playing on the backcourt with you, or you look at Sasha and Andy, you know these guys look like younger guys to you, but when you really look at it, Sasha and Andy are really older than me, but I'm kind of the leader and I'm kind of the role model for those guys. As a basketball player, I don't look -- I don't feel 22 until I really get off the court, and then I'm back and doing my usual video games and running around the house and stuff with my son, things like that.  That's when I feel 22 again.",
        "10": "I don't know.  That's not my room to say.  You know, when you look at guys who become greats, it's because of their athletic ability and their ability to do the things that they did as an individual, and I don't get involved in individual things like why do they base your game on and things like that.  That satisfies me more than anything about winning a championship, just to get the satisfaction for my teammates.  I think you become one of the greats by doing a lot of things as an individual.  They don't base that on your team's perspective and things like that.",
        "11": "That is definitely fun.  It is fun to really know that you can get stops on the defensive end, and I've been on both sides of the fence where I couldn't get stops or as a team we couldn't get stops, and it made it harder on the offensive end.  When you have a coach that tells you, hey, you guys go out there and get stops, you play defense for me and I'll let you do what you want on the offensive end, then it makes you play a lot harder.",
        "12": "It's a pride thing for us, and it's a pride thing for me to say I don't want my man to score.  You know, I kind of played both sides of the fence.  I played offense and defense in the Detroit series and I took pride in doing it because I don't want to be the one guy on the court that's not playing defense and I've got four other guys working their ass off on the defensive end.  It's not about that.  You've got to play both sides of the fence.  It just brings so much excitement when you know you can go out there and get a stop and get a run out on the other end.",
        "13": "I'm very quick.  I've always got compliments on that from coaches I've played for saying I'm a quick learner.  I'm able to adjust fast to what's going on throughout the course of a game or throughout the course of life, honestly.  I've been pretty good with it thus far.",
        "14": "Well, it is, but it was a different situation for us also being in the Eastern Conference Finals, never being part of that as an individual.  I learned from game to game to game how to adjust.  How do you adjust for the road crowd, how do you adjust for the home crowd.  I mean, I don't know, how can I explain it to you until I get into the fire, and then I'll be able to adjust on the fly and I'll be able to answer a lot better probably after Game 1, let you know how I was able to adjust throughout the course of the ballgame.",
        "15": "I feel great.  I'm ready.",
        "16": "No, we haven't been on the everyone-picks-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers side yet (smiling), so there's nothing new for us.  We just go out there and we play great basketball.  You earn respect and you get respect by playing great basketball, and we've done that throughout the last two years.  We haven't looked in the paper yet and seen the Cavaliers is picked to win the series or picked to win the game, so it's nothing new. End of FastScripts"

        "1": "LeBron, the first guy you ran to was Z, could you speak about your feelings for what he's been through, and then about how Daniel played.",
        "3": "Your individual attention on Daniel and building his confidence through the season and this series particularly.",
        "4": "LeBron, Game 5 when you scored 29 of 30 points, there was so much talk about this being a one-man team, how important was it to you tonight not only Boobie but other guys step up?  And what does this mean for the team going The Finals?",
        "6": "LeBron, I notice that in your locker you have a picture of you dunking over Tim Duncan that's been hanging up in your locker room all season.  Can you talk about it right now that you're in this position, you're going to be playing him in The Finals.  Can you talk about the emotion of getting to this point, having that picture in your locker room and now getting to have it happen.",
        "7": "LeBron, can you talk a little bit about how big of a switch in momentum it was, when Rasheed got ejected.  You guys had a double-digit lead but there was eight minutes to go and it seemed like everything swung your guys' way.",
        "8": "LeBron, when you first came into this league and joined this organization, did you have an idea of when you thought you could get this team to this point?  And also can you talk about Coach Brown who has gotten some criticism from a lot of people, including me all year long.",
        "9": "LeBron, can you talk about the significance of getting through Detroit, getting to the Finals.  You could have beaten a lot of different teams in the Eastern Conference Finals, but beating Detroit had to be special."
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "If I could put into words what's going on in my head right now, man, we would be up here for another three hours.  But this is special, the guys were really mentally prepared. We want to give Detroit a lot of credit because they definitely brought out the best in us, but we just believed and guides stepped up, no matter if it was the one guy all the way down to the 15th man on the roster, we believed.",
        "1": "Definitely, I ran to Z because when I was first drafted, Z was the first guy I seen.  Z has been through a lot, been through losing seasons, year after year after year, and I promised him when I got drafted I was going to try to change it.  If you guys remember when I was in New York, I said I was going to light it up like Vegas in Cleveland.  Awesome, I told you, I'm going to be a GM someday. I told Daniel before the game, I said, \"I believe Detroit is going to double-team me, triple me before I cross halfcourt, so get that gun and get it locked and loaded and just shoot it, don't second guess yourself, just shoot it.\"  And that's exactly what happened, and guys stepped up.  Especially Boobie stepped in, knocked big shots down.  When they closed out on him hard, he drove the ball to the rim, got fouled and made free-throws.  This is definitely a big step in Cleveland Cavaliers history.",
        "3": "I mean, when we got Daniel in the second round I believe it was a blessing in disguise, I believe we got a steal.  I just knew how good of a basketball player he could be, and once I seen his work ethic during practice, after practice, before practice, I mean, I get to the gym early, he's there before me, we're shooting after practice every single day and I just seen his drive and his passion.  And one day we had a sit-around in the locker room when we were struggling and Daniel said, \"Man, if every guy in this locker room just plays as hard as I want to play on this basketball court, we're going to be something special.\"  And for a rookie, a guy that really is not even supposed to say something or say nothing at all, I remember that, and you remember what I'm talking about, right? DANIEL GIBSON:  Yeah. LEBRON JAMES:  I remembered what he was talking about and I stayed on him from there.  I just knew he was going to be something special and tonight it was perfect.",
        "4": "You guys know how I am about my team.  There is no way we would be here in the Eastern Conference Finals or winning the Eastern Conference Finals if it was a one-man show.  It's never happened in NBA history, it would never happen in the NBA where a team has one guy and he does it all.  My teammates are my family.  I'm with them more than I am with my own family, honestly.  And every time these guys come to the gym, we believe and we made it happen.",
        "6": "San Antonio is the premier team in our league, playing the best basketball better than any team in this league; they're veterans, they've been there before, they're special.  And we've got to be even more intense, even more physically and mentally in tune to what's going on, when we enter into The Finals s on Thursday.  But just the simple fact of I've always believed in us, from day one, all you guys know I've chanted championship, one, two, three championships.  Every time we brought it up, funny faces at first looked at me.  I didn't care, I kept it going, championship, every single day.  And we've made it happen.  This is special.",
        "7": "We felt when we made our run in the fourth quarter it was starting to swing our way, something had to go right for Cleveland sports, something had to go right, and we made a real big run.  This game reminds me of my freshman year in high school in the state championship, and what Boobie did tonight reminded me of our point guard, Drew Joyce hitting six consecutives threes, he hit seven threes in a row, and we won the state championship.  They doubled me, we kicked it to Drew and he hit back to back to back to back threes in a row. And Boobie is unbelievable, what he's done, how he's grown, and I'm lost for words right now, I'm not even answering your question, (Chuckles.)  I'm so excited, I'm not answering your question at all, but you guys know how I feel right now. Yeah, it was a turn when Rasheed got a technical, I guess.  (Laughter.)",
        "8": "I never put a time limit on when I thought we could reach this point, but what I did -- I honestly believed we could get better every single year, and I mean, we won 30-something games my rookie year, we won 40 games my second year, missed the playoffs, and in my third year we win 50, my fourth year we win 50, and we've gotten better every single year I've been in this league, and we added the pieces that we needed to compete every single night and brought in a guy in Coach Brown that stresses defense, defense, defense, defense, defense, defense.  And it's unbelievable, you can have so many struggles during the course of a season, so many people criticizing your team, \"they don't have enough pieces, they're not a good outside-shooting team, Coach Brown lacks this, LeBron lacks this,\" but we've also believed and it's always been 15 guys in the locker room that just believed and we have a special team.",
        "9": "If you've been up on my commercials, someone wise told me that I couldn't get through Detroit swimming in a pool, so I guess I had to do it on the court. I think it was just our time.  It was our time.  I think Detroit, we give all the respect in the world to that team.  That team is awesome, they're great but I believe it was just our time and we're here now and we've got -- still got business to do. We're going to enjoy tonight, enjoy our day off tomorrow and get back to work on Monday and get ready for the big bad wolf of the West. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "LeBron, you scored 29 of your team's last 30 points in the fourth quarter and the two overtimes, was this just you taking the team on your back and not letting them lose?  What was your mindset?",
        "1": "LeBron were you surprised at all that through the fourth quarter and the overtime there was so much one-on-one coverage and you were able to drive the lane so easily?",
        "2": "LeBron, were you surprised how easily you were able to get to the rim, especially down the stretch?  You beat Tayshaun Prince for two dunks, one in regular time and one in overtime.",
        "3": "LeBron, where does this rank for you in terms of performances you've had in a game?",
        "4": "How do you feel right now --",
        "5": "I meant physically, are you tired?  Exhausted?",
        "6": "Are you tired?  You feel like you can --",
        "7": "LeBron, how emotional is this for you to have the kind of game you had in this environment, this situation in Game 5, and be able to play the way you played tonight?",
        "8": "When this run of yours started, this scoring, it was right after the Pistons ran off 10-0, about the middle of the fourth quarter, what are you thinking at that point?  At that point do you say, that's enough, I'm not letting this go any farther?",
        "9": "LeBron, you joked around in one of your television commercials about having to go through Detroit, for you what did the pitches represent?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Just the simple fact of us coming here in Game 1 and 2 and playing so well and falling short, and throughout this whole game we played the same way.  The same way we played in Games 1 and 2, and we couldn't leave out of here without getting at least one win, just as well as we've played in this building, and that was just my mindset.",
        "1": "I don't believe there was a lot of one-on-one coverage; there was a lot of double-teaming, a lot of triple-teaming, and I just tried to get the ball up.  They have to respect my shooters out on the court, with Daniel Gibson and Donyell Marshall and Sasha and Damon Jones and Z, you have to respect my shooters, you can't just leave them open.  So I was able to attack once I got the ball back, and make a lot of tough shots. I give all the credit to my teammates.  This is definitely not an individual performance on my part, but without those other 14 guys, we would be down 3-2 instead of up 3-2.",
        "2": "Why do I have to be surprised?  I made a lot of good moves and I was able to finish.  It wasn't just like they opened up the lane and let me through there.  I made a lot of good moves, my teammates did a good job of spacing the floor and I just wanted to try to finish.  They're definitely a great defensive team, but at times I wanted to attack as much as possible and that's it.",
        "3": "Just for the simple fact that we won the ballgame means more than anything besides my performance.  If I did everything I did tonight and we lost, it means nothing.  So the win is the most important thing for us, and we are one more win from getting to our goal.",
        "4": "Terrible.",
        "5": "Yeah, I feel terrible right now.",
        "6": "I'm everything, I'm banged up, I'm winded, I'm fatigued.  I've got all day tomorrow.  It's going to be tough to get some rest when you got a crazy two-year-old running around the house.  So hopefully I can take him to one of his grandma's house.",
        "7": "The simple fact that I was able to will my team to victory and definitely pleasing to me.  This is definitely a big win, one of the biggest wins in Cavaliers' franchise history, for me and my teammates, it's definitely the biggest win.  But we have a goal, we can't dwell on this tonight when we have another game on Saturday.  We have got to do our best to try to win that ballgame and get where we wanted to be all year.",
        "8": "The Pistons do a great job of making runs and you kind of never know when it's going to happen, but when it happens it's quick.  So I just wanted to try to be aggressive and not allow them to make too much of a run, and give ourselves an opportunity to win down at the end of regulation.  And it took two overtimes to do it, but as a team we definitely -- this is a gutted-out victory.",
        "9": "Team passion, hard work, this is a group of guys that's never going to give up, and team basketball.  When you look at San Antonio and you look at Detroit, that's what you want to be at a certain point in your career.  They've done it year after year after year after year after year after year.  So I respect the Pistons more than any team in the league just because I'm in the Eastern Conference, and I play against them as much as I do. So this is definitely a group of guys that have a lot of fight in them, and we have to take the challenge on Saturday. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "2-2 now going back to Detroit, very similar two last year.  Can you take me through the mindset of this team able to get back to this point and make this a whole new series?",
        "1": "LeBron, earlier in the playoffs you were talking about the team in the fourth quarter and how you felt good about fourth quarter situations.  The last two games were won the game in the fourth quarter.",
        "2": "LeBron, Daniel stepping up big for you guys in key points.  Can you talk about what he meant to the team and the spark he provided.",
        "3": "LeBron, with four seconds left, you're on the line.  What are your thoughts that are going through your head?",
        "4": "Was Rip bothering you?  What was he doing there?",
        "5": "I am going to ask you to put your scouting GM hat already:  Break down what was going on with you in the third quarter versus break down what you did so well and what worked for you in the third quarter.",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "We were definitely a much better team going into Detroit last year.  We won the game just because we have more playoff experience.  Last year was based on us making the playoffs; this year is based on us getting to the championships, and we have to approach it with the same mentality that we had.  Honestly for the first four games we only have two games to show for it.",
        "1": "Have to clean up that third quarter.  Good in the fourth, but that third quarter is going to catch up to us sooner or later, and I don't know what we're going to do about it.  We'll have to put our finger on it some way, some how, but we got stops down the stretch and executed on the offensive end and made big shots and that's what it's about.",
        "2": "He definitely gave us a lift throughout the whole game of attacking and getting to the rim.  You know, a lot of guys don't understand that Daniel is much better than shooting an outside shot, which I told you guys after Game 3.  He got to the line 12 times, made technical free-throws, and it's different when everybody else is up there.  It's about talent, I should be a GM someday, I guess.",
        "3": "Make both and the game is over.  You know, I don't want to make the first one, I wanted to make both and there is no way they can win the game with four seconds, and we're smart enough to know if we go up four, don't foul anyone and don't contest, we win the game. I've definitely stepped up with my free-throw percentage and it was something I had to get over with.",
        "4": "The same thing I did to Gilbert last year.  I invented that -- no, no, Scottie Pippen invented that to Karl Malone.  But he tried to mess with me and I have to stay focused.",
        "5": "I missed a lot of shots I usually make in the third quarter, I missed two lay-ups, I missed a wide-open baseline shot, but in the fourth quarter the game is on the line and I live for the fourth quarter.  I love the fourth quarter and I told my teammates, get me to the fourth and it's close, and I'll try my best to win the game and I was able to do that.",
        "7": "I think besides Drew grabbing eight rebounds and 18 points, what he did on Rasheed was big; he was able to front him and the way he played defense on Rasheed allowed us on the backside not to double Rasheed, and allowed us to stay home, and he did a heck of a job.  And to be able to guard Rasheed and score and get the rebound, it was a big inspiration to our team today.",
        "9": "I was very surprised, because I know Larry's history of injuries and -- but when I seen him in the training room with his uniform on, I asked him was he going to give it a go and he said \"yeah,\" and that showed me this is more about the team more than anything, and he did what he could. I mean, he came out there -- just being him out on the court and gutting it through.  What he's going through right now was an inspiration for us because we know he could have easily sat out tonight.  But him being on the court and saying, \"who cares about my injury.  It's about this team.\"  And it don't get no bigger than that."

        "6": "The Western Conference, you've seen the teams starting to run away with it by the middle of the second half and the fourth quarter isn't as important, what is it about the type of basketball in the Eastern Conference that makes that fourth quarter just so do or die?",
        "7": "How does that change the importance of the fourth quarter in this series?",
        "8": "Even when you finish off those two deep post catches, you sit here and don't you think it's key for you to keep doing that?",
        "9": "What about the electricity coming from the fans?  Do you sense it here in the locker room?",
        "10": "\"Execute\" is a broad word.  What do you actually do or what did you do last night to make those shots fall in?",
        "11": "There were a fair number of dunks last night that were very difficult, what changed out there?  What did you do differently and what did they do differently that opened up some of those lanes?",

        "16": "He said that he earned your trust and he could keep it by knocking down shots, how much trust do you have in him?",
        "17": "This may be over-thinking it, but is there any danger of giving him too much respect because of their history of bouncing back after losses?",
        "18": "Can you explain Mike's comment to us last night about random offense?  Just explain how random is random?",
        "19": "Is that a groove that you maybe weren't able to get into the first two games, that you kind of found a balance?",

      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Just mentally try to prepare ourselves to be focused today and try to hold down home court, make it a three-game series.  We've got to try to do our best to try to win the game.  We know they're going to come out strong, and we've got to try to match the intensity.",
        "1": "No, it's not doing the impossible when you go down 3-1.  It's definitely going to be a challenge, but we don't even want to think about that.  We want to try the tie the series up 2-2 and make it a three-game series.",
        "2": "It was about execution.  We've been able to get stops in the fourth quarter.  That hasn't been our problem.  What's been our problem is we haven't been able to execute offensively, we've turned the ball over, not even getting looks at the basket.  But we had a lot of great looks, we moved the basketball from one side to another, made a defensive shift, and we connected on it.",
        "3": "For me I watch film all the time, so I got an opportunity to watch it twice already.  It was definitely a great performance by our team.  We definitely took the challenge and we answered the call.  We did a great job of keying up our crowd's intensity, and we showed why we're one of the best teams in the NBA.",
        "4": "That wasn't much of me trying to score more, it was trying to be more aggressive, and if that had to do with me getting to the basket and scoring or making the winning play for our team, to try to make a good shot at the basket.  One thing we want to do in the second half was just try to execute, especially down the stretch, not turn the ball over, at least try to get a shot at the basket.  We knocked them down.",
        "5": "It's very important.  Like I said before, their defense is very good when you allow them to set up in the half court, and we try to want to get up the court as fast as possible, try to get some early offense opportunities, where we can get to the basket without their defense being set.  It's also important for me to catch a rhythm and it's important for our team at the same time, and we took advantage of it.",
        "6": "We definitely defend.  You know, we take pride in the Eastern Conference about defending, and that's not saying that Utah and San Antonio don't, because they're very great defensive teams, but we rely more on our defense in the Eastern Conference, and we know it's important.",
        "7": "Well, it's all about execution down the stretch.  We know the fourth quarter is definitely going to be some hard fouls, there's going to be a lot of things going on in the fourth quarter because we know the game is going to be tight.  We have to do a good job of executing offensively and defensively and try and take what's there.",
        "8": "Definitely.  I definitely felt comfortable yesterday by just trying to attack the defense early.  I got a few early post catches, didn't convert them like you said, but it felt pretty good to get down there, and it definitely helped the team.",
        "9": "Well, last night we did.  Today is definitely -- everyone is ready to eat some barbecue, I guess, and forget about last night, but we'll get ready for tomorrow night.",
        "10": "What we did was almost everyone touched the basketball.  It wasn't just give the ball to me and let me make a play and see if I can get it to somebody else.  I caught the ball in the post one time and we did a great job on the backside of flood and Daniel Gibson got a wide open three.  The next time we ran our offense I was able to come off a pick-and-roll and hit Z, and then Z hit Drew for an open jump shot.  So it's important for us to continue to move their defense because it allows us to get better shots on the backside.",
        "11": "I'm not quite sure.  Those lanes were definitely there.  I just wanted to try to attack as much as possible, and some of the small lanes that I was able to find, I wanted to be able to take advantage of.  I definitely took advantage of them and my teammates did a great job of spacing the floor to allow me to get into the lane and do the type of things I was able to do last night.",
        "12": "I don't know (laughter).  I don't know.",
        "13": "Well, as always, you need to be able to adjust -- they're definitely going to try to keep me out of the lane in the fourth quarter and the whole game, but that's been the emphasis the whole series is to try to keep me out of the lane and try to make my teammates beat them.  I think my teammates are focused, they know they're going to have to do a big part of contributing, and that's going to allow us to win.",
        "14": "He's important to our team.  Hopefully Larry is healthy enough to play tomorrow, but we don't know at this point, and if he's not, one thing that -- we've played without him.  We don't like to, but we have done it, so it's something that's not new to us.  \"Boog\" has started a lot of games this year, so he knows the role.  He knows how big he is, and he knows how to play in front of a big crowd on a big stage.",
        "15": "He's mentally prepared to play, whatever role is given to him.  It's not about what he did last night or what he's done in the past.  He's mentally prepared to go out there and be a big player on our team.  We need him out there on the court just because of the way he can shoot the ball, the way he defends, and he's going to be big for us.",
        "16": "I have a lot.  I believe every time he catches the basketball on the perimeter, he can make a basketball play, and I'm not just saying that he can cast up a three.  I believe he can do a lot of things off the dribble, he can shoot the basketball extremely well.  On the other end, he plays with a lot of heart defensively, and he showcased that last night.",
        "17": "No, it's not all about history here.  It's about us trying to hold down our home court, and it's just like us, we've been a very good team after losing ballgames, too.  I think they're going to make a lot of adjustments, we're going to make a lot of adjustments, and we'll be ready to play tomorrow.",
        "18": "You know, it's a different type of random offense.  Last night we got to a lot of random offense but we were able to be comfortable with it.  What he doesn't like is when we come down and we take early jump shots, maybe one passing shot or just come down and not get into our sets and not getting our spacing.  Last night we had a lot of random offense but it was successful because we had a lot of spacing, we had a lot of ball movement, we had a lot of player movement and it worked in our favor.",
        "19": "Oh, definitely.  You've got to try to attack this team early, as much as possible, and I think it works in our favor at times.",
        "20": "Well, it definitely hurts us.  If Larry is not able to play tomorrow it definitely hurts us because he's experienced and how well we've been with him at the point guard and how well he defends and how well he's able to shoot the ball.  It definitely will hurt us, but at the same time, the best thing about it is we've played without him.  Like I said, we don't like to, but we've played without him so guys are going to have to step up.  It's something we can't control.",
        "21": "His intensity.  I think offensively and defensively he's very in tune, and his ability to knock down open shots.  That's definitely a gift for me.  It makes sure the defense stays on us, especially with him out on the court, that he can make an open shot and he can get to the lane, also.  And then on the other end he's not a liability.  That's important for us.",
        "22": "Well, we didn't start out too good last night in the third quarter, but we definitely ended it the right way.  We didn't get too down on ourselves.  I don't know, we have to put our finger on it soon, getting better in the third quarter.",
        "23": "No, I just think his before-and-after practice workout, that he definitely stays before (and after).  I'm there before practice and he's always there, and after practice I'm shooting and he's always shooting.  When I'm off the court, he's still shooting.  He has a lot to prove, being a second-round draft pick and people saying he shouldn't have come out of college, he was too young.  He has a lot to prove. End of FastScripts"

        "0": "LeBron, what was different tonight offensively for you guys throughout the entire game that allowed you guys to get better looks and shoot a better percentage?",
        "1": "LeBron, you said earlier today that this was the biggest game of your life; you responded.  What was different?  Did you realize that just you've got to play at a different level at this point?",
        "2": "LeBron, the question on the dunk with Rasheed, just describe the play.",
        "3": "Can you talk about the last shot you made over Rip with 16 seconds to go.  Can you talk about that play.",
        "4": "LeBron, after all the debate over the first two games, are you feeling any sense of vindication whatsoever after this win?",
        "5": "You mentioned Daniel grew tonight.  Do you feel like you grew a little tonight, too?",
        "6": "It just seemed like you were not only trying to push along Daniel but everybody else on your team.  We could see you during timeouts yelling encouragement.  What were you thinking during timeouts and what made you grow aggressively in the huddle?",
        "7": "Could you talk a little bit about Zydrunas and when he's playing like he did tonight, what that does for the rest of your offense?",
        "8": "When you were preparing for this game we asked you what you specifically wanted to do, and you said that you personally wanted to be more aggressive.  Can you analyze for us to what degree you were more aggressive in this game and how.",
        "10": "LeBron, you talked about how starved this city is for a winner and a championship, can you talk about the crowd and what that means to both of you guys when you're out there.",
        "12": "LeBron, having won a game like this, do you feel like now you've learned how to win close playoff games?",
        "13": "You told us before you did a little bit more unusual pregame preparation for today, can you tell us more about your morning and afternoon and any meaningful conversations you might have had with your family.",
        "14": "Will you do the same Tuesday?"
      },
      "answers": {
        "0": "Well, we did a great job of coming down the early offense and getting to our offense a lot quicker, attacking a lot quicker before their defense set.  They're very good when you allow them to set up.  So we did a great job of coming down early on offense, moving the ball, getting it from one side to the other, drive and kick, and it worked for us.",
        "1": "It's all or nothing at this point.  You either make a series and be 2-1 or you make the impossible and be down 3-0.  It's common sense.  For me it was the biggest game of my career, and I was happy that my teammates were able to help me get through it, and we won a big game.",
        "2": "Any time you get on offensive rebound, it allows the defense not to set.  So I just wanted to try to be aggressive and I was able to get to the hole and seen the open lane and was able to make something happen.",
        "3": "It was definitely an opportunity for me to just -- just wanting to be aggressive and try to see the whole floor.  If a double-team came, try to get the ball up, and if not, try to be as patient as I could, try to get the shot clock, try to get some time off of it.  I didn't want to force it to the basket.  I was able to take just a very comfortable mid-range jump shot and it was a big play for us.",
        "4": "No, all I'm excited about was I was able to get a team victory.  This guy sitting next to me is growing up before our eyes, and he played some big minutes for us tonight.  Defensively he was very in tune and we responded.",
        "5": "I grow a little every night.  I need my teammates out on the court to make me grow.  You see a guy like Daniel, as young as he is and as young as I am, we're out there working as hard as we can to try to win ballgames.  It's a great opportunity and great to see he made the most of it. We ain't done yet.  We've still got to hold down home court and try to make it a three-game series.",
        "6": "Being in the same situation honestly in the first two games, you don't want to let one slip away again.  I could see if we could just get over the hump finally, we could win this ballgame.  We finally got the stop that we needed.  We finally made the offensive execution play that we needed.  I wanted to make sure that the guys were very in tune and know that hey, we need one more stop here, we need the offensive execution, and win the ballgame, and the guys responded.",
        "7": "Well, it definitely helps us perimeter guys when you have inside presence, and Z shot the ball extremely well.  He defended extremely well and it just spreads the defense out when you have a guy that's seven-foot tall that can shoot outside jumpers and get to the lane.  As perimeter guys we need that production out of our bigs, and he showed up tonight and it was great to see.",
        "8": "Just not holding the ball as much and allowing our defense to set.  Like I said before, they're very, very good when you allow them to set up.  I was very aggressive early in trying to attack before their five guys were able to set up on the defensive end.  I was a little bit more aggressive on the post, not allowing their guys to bump me out to the perimeter.  Once I started getting some easy buckets, that opened up my outside shot.  Very productive.",
        "10": "Well, we knew it was going to be electrifying tonight, first time since '92.  Like I said before, I was a WWF fan at that time, so I don't know what Cleveland sports was doing at that time. The crowd was exciting.  We need them to be the same way on Tuesday because they really helped us.  It gets us a little bit more energy when they're out there cheering.  I mean, they deserve it.  We haven't had a Cleveland sports team or Ohio sports team win in a long time, so they really deserve it.",
        "12": "I've won a lot of playoff games in my two years in the playoffs.  I mean, I just try to be the best player I can be out there for my teammates.  You learn from mistakes, you learn from wins and you learn from losses, but this game doesn't put something on me where it's saying, hey, I've finally done it.  I've won playoff games before, I've won playoff series.  This is a big game and we won it and we need to move on.",
        "13": "It's the first time in my career I've ever showed up to the gym three hours before a game.  I usually take my nap before the game, and I woke up earlier today, so I had nothing else to do.  I didn't want to sit around.  I didn't want to continue to answer my phone about tickets (laughter), so I came to the gym and I turned my phone off and I was here, and the guys were still setting up the camera on the baskets. The mindset that I had today coming to this ballgame was we have to win, simple as that.  We have to win.  And me being the leader of this team, I have to be that guy that sparks this team, I have to be that guy that does it on both ends of the floor, but at the same time, my teammates, when they see that, they have to respond, also, with me, and I guess we did it.",

        "1": "It's about the same honestly.  We had a very physical run against New Jersey, a little bit more than we expected, but we kind of took it for what it was.  About the same.",
        "2": "Definitely, definitely.",
        "3": "We've been here before.  That's the best thing that can happen to us right now is we've been in this position before, so we know how to react to it.  Being down 0-2, never being in that position before we wouldn't know what to do, so we've been here before so we should know what to do and how to catch them.",
        "4": "We've definitely talked about the course of the playoffs before the playoffs started, good luck to each other, and since he's been home and rehabbing, basketball highlights, injuries going, and he was able to get successful surgery on his shoulder and stuff like that, and he's just telling me play as hard as possible and lead my team to victory.  He's definitely given me some pointers.",
        "5": "Well, basically just trying to be more aggressive against Detroit's defense.  They're definitely a team where you definitely hold the ball, so just try to score more in early offense and not allow them to set up.",
        "6": "Shoot the ball every time, I guess.  He doesn't give good advice all the time.",
        "7": "He's very active, and definitely he helps the guys that's guarding on the ball.  He's a great outside defender.  He's very long so you try to attack him, he's very capable of moving his feet and sliding and getting some good shots blocked.  He's definitely a big part of the defensive scheme.",
        "8": "Our crowd knows how important they are going to be tomorrow.  They should come in with a lot of energy, and we look forward to seeing our fans tomorrow night.",

        "0": "Well, I thought so.  You're not allowed to use your hands on the perimeter once a guy starts penetrating towards the basket.  There was a lot of physical contact throughout the course of the game, so I don't want to look back at just that one play, but it could have made a difference.",
        "1": "Absolutely not.  I wanted to be aggressive, and I was able to do that and I was able to create some contact.",
        "2": "Well, no, I found that he was right on one side of my move, so I was able to spin, and once I went up to my shot, I felt some more contact.  But I guess -- you call this playoff basketball, I do the best I can do and hopefully we get some respect at some point.",
        "3": "No, I still made some passes throughout the course of the ballgame.  I made one that was called for a turnover that wasn't a turnover on Sasha.  We had an open look and he was able to pass the ball before it landed. But I try to take what's there.  You don't want to try to force anything because they're a very good defensive team.  We fell short again.",
        "4": "I don't know, I can't put a finger on it right now.  If we could, we'd be able to fix it.  We can't put our finger on it right now, but it has to get better and soon, or we're not going to be in the best position possible in this series.  We have to try our best, try to fix it and come out in the third quarter with a little bit more focus, try to attack their pressure because they come out with a lot of aggressiveness on the defensive end and just try to get better.  We have to do it now.  We can't wait until Game 4.  We have to do it now.  We have to get better at it.",
        "5": "We're starting off with too many jump shots.  We're having a lead, we feel like we can continue to shoot jump shots and then they get on the other end and they get fouls or they get dunks or they get lay-ups.  They do a better job of trying to go inside, trying to get some contact, trying to get early in the penalty in the third quarter.  I have to do a better job of that, also, and my team has to do a better job of reacting to what's going on in the third.",
        "6": "Yeah, I have to, or we're not going to win this series, simple as that.  I'm the leader of this team and I have to do more on the defensive end and offensive end.  For us to win ballgames, we have to make better decisions down the stretch and eliminate some of the mistakes that I make throughout the course of the ballgame.  It is some room for improvement with us, and we have time.  Have to win four out of five.  It's not impossible, but we have to do it now.",
        "7": "I don't know, you just have to wing it.  You just have to see during the course of the ballgame what's there for you as an individual, what's there for your team, what's the best fit, and we have to go with it.  At a point if we have something that's very comfortable to us, we have to stick with it.  Everyone just has to continue to play hard, which we've done the first two games but we haven't played hard enough to win.",

He's definitely done a good job on the offensive end, too.  He's definitely one of the best power forwards in this league.  His numbers don't speak for it, but everyone knows how well of a player he is.",
        "9": "Because I'm still in the playoffs, I guess.  You wouldn't talk about it if I was at home, you know?  You have to have something to talk about.  I make the decisions and I live with them.  You know, my teammates respect the decisions that I make and I've always come through for them, if it's either late or early in the game.  It doesn't bother me at all.",

        "11": "No, I wanted to -- when I decided to attack I wanted -- the best thing I wanted to do was, hey, if I get the ball to the rim, just give us another opportunity to get a look at it, and we did.  Larry got a great look and Andy got a great tip at it.  So I started to attack, I seen him start to shift and I backed up a little bit more and I started to attack again and created some contact and created some more contact and we was able to get another look at it.  You live with it.",
        "12": "I think it's all about paying dues right now, you know, earning respect.  You look at it, you can say, hey, these guys have been in the Conference Finals five years in a row.  This is our first time in a long time.  Right now it seems like it's about paying our dues and earning respect to everybody.",
        "13": "I'm not sure.",
        "14": "It's a challenge, but it's nothing we haven't been part of before.  We was down 2-0 to these guys last year, even though last year is not this year, but we've been in this situation.  It's always good to be in certain situations.  We've been up 2-0, we've been down 2-0, so we have to see how we react. Our fans are great and hopefully they'll do a great job of supporting us on Sunday.",
        "15": "I think it is.  You know, you just don't care about where your man is, they can just kind of react to letting the pass go and kind of react to it.  They have a great defensive strategy.  Those guys are doing a great job of just trying to make me do some things that's out of my comfort zone.",
        "16": "It says that I'm just not a one-man show.  That's what it says to me.  I have a great team, and out of 30 teams we're still here.  You know, no one ever looks at that, they just look at, hey, we had an easy run, we played a team in Washington that was depleted and we played a team in New Jersey that had no inside presence, but it's never the Cavs won these ballgames.  It's never that.  Whenever anybody else wins, they did a great job of executing, they did a great job of winning ballgames down the stretch.  But when we win it's like the other team was depleted or they didn't do a great job of making things happen.  It's just we have to earn respect.  I don't know how we do that, but I guess you do it by winning, and we've done nothing but win in this postseason.",
        "17": "We don't want to make excuses.  We've been a no-excuse team all year.  Everyone knows how we felt throughout the course of that game, but we got an opportunity to really calm down and prepare ourselves for Game 3.  It was definitely a situation where maybe things could have got out of hand on that podium with me up there last night and with Coach, also.  You guys could see it in our guys that we maybe wanted to say something, but it's not about that.  You have to just learn from what happened and maybe try to execute a little bit better the next time. End of FastScripts"

That's something as a team we've got to figure it out, but they do a great job in the third quarter of coming out and putting the pressure on you.  We haven't been a good third quarter team all year.  I don't know why.  That's something we'll have to figure out very soon or we're going home. End of FastScripts"
